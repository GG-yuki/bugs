            "report_content": "Texas v. Pennsylvania, 592 U.S. ___ (2020), was a lawsuit filed at the United States Supreme Court contesting the administration of the 2020 presidential election in certain states, in which Joe Biden defeated incumbent Donald Trump.\nFiled by Texas State Attorney General Ken Paxton on December 8, 2020, under the Supreme Court's original jurisdiction, Texas v. Pennsylvania alleged that Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin violated the United States Constitution by changing election procedures through non-legislative means. The suit sought to temporarily withhold the certified vote count from these four states prior to the Electoral College vote on December 14. The suit was filed after about 90 lawsuits arising from disputes over the election results filed by Trump and the Republican Party had failed in numerous state and federal courts.\nThe suit had been drafted by a team of lawyers with ties to the Trump presidential campaign. Paxton agreed to file the case after other state attorneys general declined to so. The Solicitor General of Texas Kyle D. Hawkins objected to the suit and refused to let his name be added. Paxton hired Lawrence J. Joseph, who had helped draft the suit, as special counsel to assist with the suit.[1]\nWithin one day of Texas's filing, Trump, over 100 Republican Representatives, and 18 Republican state attorneys general filed motions to support the case.[2][3] The incumbent president referred to this case as \"the big one\".[4] Attorneys general for the defendant states, joined in briefs submitted by their counterparts from twenty other states, two territories, and the District of Columbia,[5] urged the Court to refuse the case, with Pennsylvania's brief calling it a \"seditious abuse of the judicial process\".[6] Legal experts argued that the case was not likely to be heard and not likely to succeed if it did get heard, and that it was thus a \"Hail Mary\" action.[7][8][9]\nThe Supreme Court issued orders on December 11, declining to hear the case on the basis that Texas lacked standing under Article III of the Constitution to challenge the results of the election held by another state.[10][11]\nSeveral states changed their voting laws prior to the 2020 United States presidential election to make postal voting easier, due to fears that in-person voting would expose people to COVID-19. Numerous legal challenges to voting changes were raised across the country. A number of these cases involved voting regulations that were altered by states' executive branches and not by state legislatures. In Texas v. Pennsylvania, Texas claimed that such alterations violated Article Two of the United States Constitution.[12]\nThe initial tallies of votes in the election, completed within the week of election day, showed that Joe Biden had won sufficient votes in the Electoral College to secure the presidency over incumbent Donald Trump. Trump and the Republican National Committee (RNC) launched numerous lawsuits against various swing states challenging their vote tallies, particularly in states that had voted for Trump in the 2016 United States presidential election but had turned to Biden in 2020, such as Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, and Georgia. Most of these cases raised by Trump and the RNC have been dismissed on procedural grounds or rejected on substantive grounds in the courts, and in so being have not affected the projected Electoral College result.[13] PolitiFact noted that the forces behind reversing the election had by this point \"lost dozens of election lawsuits.\"[14]\nBefore and after the election, Trump stated his expectation that the Supreme Court would determine the outcome. After the election, his legal team sought a path to bring a case before the Court, on which conservative justices—including three appointed by Trump—held a 6–3 majority.[15]\nThe case was filed on December 8, 2020, directly with the Supreme Court as it holds original jurisdiction over disputes between states.[16][17][18] Such cases are infrequent: there were 123 \"original jurisdiction\" cases from 1789 to 1959.[19] Original jurisdiction cases are immediately docketed pursuant to Rule 17 once the plaintiff submits its motion for leave to file and pays its docket fees.[20][a] Because the suit requested expedited consideration, the Court set a deadline at 3:00 p.m. on December 10 for the four defendant states to respond.[19][21] Whereas a typical case submitted through a writ of certiorari requires only four justices to accept to be certified by the Supreme Court, this case would have required five justices.[22]\nThe suit was filed by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton. It claimed that Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin violated the Constitution by changing their election procedures to limit the spread of COVID-19.[23] The case was filed on the same day as the \"safe harbor\" threshold, beyond which Congress must accept certified results from states ahead of the Electoral College's official vote on December 14, 2020.[18][16] The suit alleged that the four states \"ignor[ed] statutory requirements as to how [mail-in ballots] were received, evaluated and counted\".[24] It further argued that electoral processes in the four defendant states \"suffered from significant and unconstitutional irregularities\", and therefore that it was not clear who \"legitimately won the 2020 election\".[25]\nIn the lawsuit, Texas alleged that the defendant states, by changing their election processes, violated three clauses of the Constitution: the Electors Clause (Article II, Section 1, Clause 2), the Equal Protection Clause, and the Due Process Clause.[26][27] In particular, it argued the Constitution requires changes to electoral procedures to be made only by state legislatures, and not by executives such as secretaries of state.[28] Accordingly, it argued, changes to election procedures made by executive action, and not by alterations to state law, rendered election results constitutionally infirm.[28]\nTexas argued it had standing to sue to prevent its votes from becoming \"diluted\".[29] Texas instead alleged that \"fraud becomes undetectable\" because \"unlawful actions of election officials effectively destroy the evidence\". Whether \"voters committed fraud\" was not the \"constitutional issue\" in this case, according to Texas. Therefore, Texas declared that it did not need to \"prove\" fraud.[30]\nTexas sought relief by requesting the Supreme Court block those four states from voting in the electoral college and extend the deadline by which states must submit their certified vote.[23]\nTexas, in its December 11 response to the defendant states, stated \"Defendant States do not seriously address grave issues that Texas raises, choosing to hide behind other court venues and decisions in which Texas could not participate and to mischaracterize both the relief that Texas seeks and the justification for that relief.\"[31] In an interview, Paxton further argued that \"the only place we can file is the Supreme Court, and we did what we did appropriately, so to call it 'seditious' is really ridiculous.\"[32] In response to commentators who said the action was a Hail Mary, Paxton said, \"Unless you throw the pass, you can't complete it.\"[32]\nAttorneys general of seventeen additional states filed a joint brief on December 9 supporting Texas.[33][19][34]\nOn the same day, Trump filed a motion to intervene in his personal capacity, thereby attempting to join the case as a plaintiff.[35] Trump's brief was filed by Chapman University School of Law professor John C. Eastman, who in August 2020 authored an article published in Newsweek questioning Kamala Harris's eligibility for the position of vice president.[36] On social media, the president referred to the case as \"the big one\".[37] Over 120 Republican members of the House of Representatives filed an amicus in support of the suit, including leader Kevin McCarthy and his deputy Steve Scalise.[38][39][40]\n106 members of the House initially signed on to the lawsuit in support of the plaintiff.[41] 20 additional members of the House signed on to the lawsuit in support of the plaintiff before it was dismissed.[42]\nLater on December 10, attorneys general of six states that had already responded in an amicus brief, Arkansas, Utah, Louisiana, Missouri, Mississippi and South Carolina, petitioned to the Supreme Court to let them join Texas as a plaintiff in the case.[43] This effort was led by Missouri Attorney General Eric Schmitt.[43]\nAn amicus curiae brief on the side of the defendants was filed by a group of former Republican office holders and officials.[44]\nThe defendant states responded on December 10, urging the Court to reject the case. Pennsylvania's reply called the suit a \"seditious abuse of the judicial process\".[6] The states urged that the justices \"send a clear and unmistakable signal that such abuse must never be replicated\".[6]\nAttorneys general of the District of Columbia, Guam, the Virgin Islands, and 20 states filed a brief in support of the defendant states the same day:[5][45]\nAlthough Montana Attorney General Tim Fox participated in the joint brief filed on December 9 supporting Texas,[34] Montana Governor Steve Bullock filed a separate brief on December 10 in support of the defendants.[46]\nOn December 10, Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost filed a motion supporting neither side, but stated that \"the [s]tates need this Court to decide, at the earliest available opportunity, the question whether the Electors Clause permits state courts (and state executive officials) to alter the rules by which presidential elections are conducted.\"[47] Yost also stated Ohio could not support Texas's request for relief because Ohio's position is that state legislatures' power over elections should not be overridden by federal courts.[27] Arizona also filed a brief on jurisdiction but supporting neither party.[5]\nThe suit was criticized by legal experts and called \"outlandish\".[48][18][49] University of Texas School of Law law professor Stephen I. Vladeck called the suit the \"craziest lawsuit filed to purportedly challenge the election\". Election law expert Rick Hasen characterized the lawsuit as a \"press release masquerading as a lawsuit\" and \"the dumbest case I've ever seen filed on an emergency basis at the Supreme Court.\"[50][49] Edward Foley, director of the election law program at Ohio State University, urged the court to ignore the case and refrain from interfering in the election.[17]\nAlan Dershowitz of Harvard Law School described the 11th-hour case a \"Hail Mary pass\" that was \"creative but unlikely to win\", because alleging that Texas, instead of its voters, was injured (in order to bypass the Eleventh Amendment to the U.S. Constitution) is \"far-fetched\"; he also expressed concern that the case was filed too late.[9]\nSenator Ted Cruz, who has served as Solicitor General of Texas and has argued several cases before the Court, accepted Trump's request to argue the case should the Court hear it.[51]\nLaw professor Noah Feldman characterized the lawsuit as a coup attempt by Republicans to overturn the results of the election.[52]\nLegal experts also did not expect the Supreme Court to certify the case, given its reluctance to hear post-election challenges. On the same day as Texas's filing, the Court refused to hear arguments in another post-election challenge, Kelly v. Pennsylvania, without any dissents.[22][53] The defendants also argued that the legal principle of laches, which may bar an action if it is filed too late, is grounds for dismissing Texas's claim.[31][54][b]\nRepublican Texas Governor Greg Abbott signaled his support for the case, saying the case \"tries to accelerate the process, providing certainty and clarity about the entire election process. The United States of America needs that.\"[23]\nPresident Trump retweeted several tweets that expressed support for the suit.[16] On December 9, he promised to intervene in the suit,[55] and filed a motion to do so the same day,[35][56][57] thereby attempting to join the case as a plaintiff. On December 10, he tweeted \"the Supreme Court has a chance to save our Country from the greatest Election abuse in the history of the United States.\"[58] On December 11 he tweeted, \"I just want to stop the world from killing itself! ... Now that the Biden Administration will be a scandal plagued mess for years to come, it is much easier for the Supreme Court of the United States to follow the Constitution and do what everybody knows has to be done.\"[4]\nRepublican Senators David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler, both involved in close runoff races in Georgia, voiced support for the suit.[59] In a tweet, Republican Missouri attorney general Eric Schmitt stated his support for the suit, promising to \"lead the effort in support of Texas's #SCOTUS filing today\".[60] On Twitter, Republican Arkansas attorney general Leslie Rutledge stated she would legally support the motion.[61] Republican Louisiana attorney general Jeff Landry also supported the complaint.[62]\nIn response to an email to every Republican member of the House of Representatives from Representative Mike Johnson of Louisiana, 125 Republicans joined him to sign an amicus brief supporting the suit.[63][64] The number represented a clear majority of the Republican caucus in the House.[4] Politico referred to the large number of GOP House members supporting the suit as \"jaw-dropping\".[65] Republican members of the Senate, on the other hand, were much less likely to speak in favor of the suit, reflecting their different temperaments and political imperatives.[65]\nThe office of Republican Georgia attorney general Chris Carr also criticized the suit and Paxton. On December 8, Carr's spokeswoman said that Paxton was \"constitutionally, legally[,] and factually wrong about Georgia\".[49][24] Georgia's deputy secretary of state Jordan Fuchs denounced the suit as \"false and irresponsible\".[18] Trump warned Carr to not rally other Republican officials in opposition to the suit, and the Republican majority in the Georgia State Senate expressed their approval for the filing.[66][49][24]\nDemocratic Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel criticized the suit, labelling it a \"publicity stunt ... beneath the dignity\" of the Texas attorney general office and saying \"[t]he erosion of confidence in our democratic system isn't attributable to the good people of Michigan, Wisconsin, Georgia[,] or Pennsylvania but rather to partisan officials, like Mr. Paxton, who place loyalty to a person over loyalty to their country.\"[16] Wisconsin Attorney General Josh Kaul called the case \"genuinely embarrassing\".[18] Pennsylvania attorney general Josh Shapiro stated that \"[t]hese continued attacks on our fair and free election system are beyond meritless, beyond reckless—they are a scheme by the President of the United States and some in the Republican party to disregard the will of the people—and name their own victors.\"[29]\nAttorney and Lincoln Project founder George Conway called the lawsuit the \"most insane thing yet\".[67] Former Federal Elections Commissioner Hans von Spakovsky said, \"By almost any measure, this is the legal equivalent of a Hail Mary pass.\"[8]\nChip Roy, a Republican Texas congressman and former chief of staff to Texas senator Ted Cruz, characterized the suit as \"a dangerous violation of federalism [that] sets a precedent to have one state asking federal courts to police the voting procedures of other states\".[68] Republican Texas senator and former Texas Supreme Court justice John Cornyn said he was unable \"to understand the legal theory\" behind the suit.[69]\nGovernor Gary Herbert and Governor-elect Spencer Cox of Utah, both Republicans, denounced Republican Utah state attorney general Sean Reyes's decision to join the amicus brief in support of the lawsuit.[70] Several other states also saw division among Republicans about whether coming out in favor of the suit was wise.[58] The Associated Press wrote that the action \"has quickly become a conservative litmus test.\"[58]\nMichael Steele, formerly the chair of the Republican National Committee, called Republican House members' decision to join the suit \"an offense to the Constitution\" that would \"leave[] an indelible stain\" on their \"political skin\".[71] Jeb Bush opined on the suit: \"This is crazy. It will be killed on arrival\".[72]\nTexas Solicitor General Kyle Hawkins, who normally would speak on behalf of the state in matters before the Supreme Court, was not listed on the suit.[43]\nThe lawsuit included a declaration from Charles Cicchetti, who claimed that his statistical analysis showed that there was a less than one-in-one-quadrillion chance of Biden's having won any of the states in question. Cicchetti's analysis was widely criticized,[73] since it assumed that voters behaved the same in 2020 as they had in 2016[74] and because it assumed that vote tallying patterns were random over time. In reality, Biden was a different candidate than Hillary Clinton had been in 2016, and the marked shift of early Republican vote counts to later Democratic votes counts had been anticipated well in advance, because several battleground states had forbidden mail-in ballots from being counted earlier; mail-in ballots favored Biden in part because Trump had long attempted to discredit the reliability of mail-in voting.[6]\nWriting at PolitiFact, Eric Litke described the analysis as \"wildly illogical\", citing professors of political science who described the analysis as \"ludicrous\" and \"statistical incompetence\", with one wrong assumption being that \"votes are all independently and randomly distributed\".[75] At The Volokh Conspiracy, David Post described Cicchetti's analysis as \"idiotic\" because it was based on two blatantly false assumptions: (1) that voters' preferences had not changed since 2016, and (2) that party preferences did not differ between mail-in and in-person voters. Post stated that Paxton's use of Cicchetti's work was \"unethical\" because Paxton had not mentioned Cicchetti's key assumptions.[76] At The Washington Post, Philip Bump said that the analysis in the lawsuit was \"utterly ridiculous\", noting that the 2016 results could not be extrapolated to 2020, because Biden was more popular than Clinton and because voters had become more polarized. Bump also wrote that vote-counting was not \"homogeneous\", with the \"blue shift\" phenomenon being entirely expected due to mail-in ballots favoring Biden.[77]\nOn December 11, in an unsigned ruling, the court ruled that Texas lacked standing and denied the suit.[78][79][80][81]\nThe State of Texas's motion for leave to file a bill of complaint is denied for lack of standing under Article III of the Constitution. Texas has not demonstrated a judicially cognizable interest in the manner in which another State conducts its elections. All other pending motions are dismissed as moot.[11][82]\nJustice Alito, joined by Justice Thomas, disagreed with the ruling denying leave to file a bill of complaint, but did not otherwise find for the plaintiffs. He wrote that the Court is duty-bound to hear the case, referencing Thomas's dissent in Arizona v. California, 589 U. S. ___ (Feb. 24, 2020):\nIn my view, we do not have discretion to deny the filing of a bill of complaint in a case that falls within our original jurisdiction ... I would therefore grant the motion to file the bill of complaint but would not grant other relief, and I express no view on any other issue.[11]\nAfter the Court declined to hear the case, Allen West, chairman of the Republican Party of Texas, suggested that \"law-abiding states should bond together and form a Union of states that will abide by the constitution\".[83] The statement was criticized by Illinois Republican Adam Kinzinger, saying the call for secession was dangerous. The Lincoln Project's George Conway and National Review editor Rich Lowry also criticized West's remarks, stating they were unrepresentative of the \"Party of Lincoln\".[84]\nPresident Trump harshly criticized the Court's decision, saying \"This is a great and disgraceful miscarriage of justice. The people of the United States were cheated, and our Country disgraced. Never even given our day in Court!\"[85][86] White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany echoed the notion that the case was never given a chance, saying the justices \"hid behind procedure ... There's no way to say it other than they dodged.\"[87] Paxton, for his part, said the decision was \"unfortunate\".[88]\nThe Biden campaign said of the ruling: \"The Supreme Court has decisively and speedily rejected the latest of Donald Trump and his allies' attacks on the democratic process. This is no surprise—dozens of judges, election officials from both parties, and Trump's own attorney general have dismissed his baseless attempts to deny that he lost the election.\"[89]\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi issued a statement that \"The Court has rightly dismissed out of hand the extreme, unlawful and undemocratic GOP lawsuit to overturn the will of millions of American voters.\" and admonished that \"Republicans must once and for all end their election subversion—immediately.\" Additionally she reprimanded House members who supported the lawsuit: \"The 126 Republican Members that signed onto this lawsuit brought dishonor to the House.  Instead of upholding their oath to support and defend the Constitution, they chose to subvert the Constitution and undermine public trust in our sacred democratic institutions.\"[90][91]\nNew Jersey Representative Bill Pascrell, citing section three of the 14th Amendment, called for Pelosi to not seat Republicans who signed the amicus curiae brief supporting the suit. This proposal would not seat nearly two-thirds of the Republican representatives of the incoming 117th United States Congress. Pascrell stated, \"The text of the 14th Amendment expressly forbids Members of Congress from engaging in rebellion against the United States. Trying to overturn a democratic election and install a dictator seems like a pretty clear example of that.\"[92]",

            "report_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Cruz",
            "report_content": "Rafael Edward \"Ted\" Cruz (/kruːz/; born December 22, 1970) is an American  politician and attorney serving as the junior United States senator for Texas since 2013. A member of the Republican Party, Cruz served as Solicitor General of Texas from 2003 to 2008.\nAfter graduating from Princeton University and Harvard Law School, Cruz pursued a career in politics. He worked as a policy advisor in the George W. Bush administration before serving as Solicitor General of Texas from 2003 to 2008. In 2012, Cruz was elected to the U.S. Senate, becoming the first Hispanic American to serve as a U.S. senator from Texas. In the Senate, Cruz has taken consistently conservative positions on economic and social policy; he played a leading role in the 2013 United States federal government shutdown, seeking to force Congress and President Barack Obama to defund the Affordable Care Act. He was reelected in a close Senate race in 2018 against Democratic candidate Beto O'Rourke.\nIn 2016, Cruz ran for President of the United States, placing second behind Donald Trump in the Republican primaries. The competition for the Republican presidential nomination between Trump and Cruz was deeply acrimonious and characterized by a series of public personal attacks. While Cruz initially declined to endorse Trump's campaign once he won the nomination, he became a staunch Trump supporter during the latter's presidency. After the January 2021 Capitol attack, Cruz provoked widespread political and popular backlash for objecting to the certification of Joe Biden's victory in the 2020 presidential election and giving credence to the false claim that the election was stolen from Trump.[2]\nRafael Edward Cruz was born on December 22, 1970,[3][4] at Foothills Medical Centre[5][6] in Calgary, Alberta, Canada, to Eleanor Elizabeth (née Darragh) Wilson and Rafael Cruz.[7][8][9][10] Eleanor Wilson was born in Wilmington, Delaware. She is of three-quarters Irish and one-quarter Italian descent, and earned an undergraduate degree in mathematics from Rice University in the 1950s.[11][12]\nCruz's father was born and raised in Cuba, the son of a Canary Islander who immigrated to Cuba as child.[13] As a teenager in the 1950s, he was beaten by agents of Fulgencio Batista for opposing the Batista regime.[14] He left Cuba in 1957 to attend the University of Texas at Austin and obtained political asylum in the United States after his four-year student visa expired.[15] He earned Canadian citizenship in 1973[5] and became a naturalized United States citizen in 2005.[9][16][17]\nAt the time of his birth, Ted Cruz's parents had lived in Calgary for three years and were working in the oil business as owners of a seismic-data processing firm for oil drilling.[9][18][19][20][21] Cruz has said that he is the son of \"two mathematicians/computer programmers.\"[22] In 1974, Cruz's father left the family and moved to Texas.[23] Later that year, Cruz's parents reconciled and relocated the family to Houston.[5] They divorced in 1997.[24] Cruz has two older half-sisters, Miriam Ceferina Cruz and Roxana Lourdes Cruz, from his father's first marriage. Miriam died in 2011.[24][25][26]\nCruz began going by Ted at age 13.[27]\nFor junior high school Cruz went to Awty International School in Houston.[28] Cruz attended two private high schools: Faith West Academy, near Katy, Texas;[29] and Second Baptist High School in Houston, from which he graduated as valedictorian in 1988.[16][30][31] During high school, Cruz participated in a Houston-based group known at the time as the Free Market Education Foundation, a program that taught high school students the philosophies of economists such as Milton Friedman and Frédéric Bastiat.[21][32]\nCruz graduated cum laude from Princeton University in 1992 with a Bachelor of Arts in public policy[33] from the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs.[3][34] While at Princeton, he competed for the American Whig-Cliosophic Society's Debate Panel and won the top speaker award at both the 1992 U.S. National Debating Championship and the 1992 North American Debating Championship.[35] In 1992, he was named U.S. National Speaker of the Year and, with his debate partner David Panton, Team of the Year by the American Parliamentary Debate Association.[35] Cruz and Panton later represented Harvard Law School at the 1995 World Debating Championship, losing in the semifinals to a team from Australia.[36][37][38] Princeton's debate team named their annual novice championship after Cruz.[38] At Princeton, Cruz was a member of Colonial Club.[39]\nCruz's 115-page senior thesis at Princeton investigated the separation of powers; its title, Clipping the Wings of Angels: The History and Theory behind the Ninth and Tenth Amendments of the United States Constitution, was inspired by a passage attributed to James Madison from the 51st essay of the Federalist Papers: \"If angels were to govern men, neither external nor internal controls on government would be necessary.\" Cruz argued that the drafters of the Constitution intended to protect their constituents' rights, and that the last two items in the Bill of Rights offer an explicit stop against an all-powerful state.[11][40]\nAfter graduating from Princeton, Cruz attended Harvard Law School, graduating magna cum laude in 1995 with a Juris Doctor degree.[3][41] While at Harvard Law, he was a primary editor of the Harvard Law Review, an executive editor of the Harvard Journal of Law and Public Policy, and a founding editor of the Harvard Latino Law Review.[34] Referring to Cruz's time as a student at Harvard Law, Professor Alan Dershowitz said: \"Cruz was off-the-charts brilliant.\"[42][43][44][45] At Harvard Law, Cruz was a John M. Olin Fellow in Law and Economics.[46]\nCruz serves on the Board of Advisors of the Texas Review of Law and Politics.[47]\nCruz served as a law clerk to J. Michael Luttig of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit in 1995[46][48] and to William Rehnquist, Chief Justice of the United States, in 1996.[3]\nAfter Cruz finished his clerkships, he took a position with Cooper, Carvin & Rosenthal, now known as Cooper & Kirk, PLLC, from 1997 to 1998.[49] At the firm, Cruz worked on matters relating to the National Rifle Association and helped prepare testimony for the impeachment proceedings against President Bill Clinton.[50] In 1998, Cruz was briefly one of the attorneys who represented Representative John Boehner during his litigation against Representative Jim McDermott over the alleged leak of an illegal recording of a phone conversation whose participants included Boehner.[51][52]\nCruz joined the George W. Bush presidential campaign in 1999 as a domestic policy adviser, advising then-Governor Bush on a wide range of policy and legal matters, including civil justice, criminal justice, constitutional law, immigration, and government reform.[49] During the 2000 Florida presidential recounts, he assisted in assembling the Bush legal team, devising strategy, and drafting pleadings for filing with the Supreme Court of Florida and U.S. Supreme Court in the case Bush v. Gore.[46][53] Cruz recruited future Chief Justice John Roberts and noted attorney Mike Carvin to Bush's legal team.[50]\nAfter Bush took office, Cruz served as an Associate Deputy Attorney General in the U.S. Justice Department[3][53] and as the director of policy planning at the U.S. Federal Trade Commission.[3][42][53]\nAppointed to the office of Solicitor General of Texas by Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott,[48][54] Cruz served in that position from 2003 to 2008.[32][46] The office was established in 1999 to handle appeals involving the state, but Abbott hired Cruz with the idea that Cruz would take a \"leadership role in the United States in articulating a vision of strict constructionism\". As Solicitor General, Cruz argued before the Supreme Court of the United States nine times, winning five cases and losing four.[50]\nCruz authored 70 U.S. Supreme Court briefs and presented 43 oral arguments.[42][48][55] His nine appearances before the Supreme Court are the most by any practicing lawyer in Texas or current member of Congress.[56] Cruz has said, \"We ended up year after year arguing some of the biggest cases in the country. There was a degree of serendipity in that, but there was also a concerted effort to seek out and lead conservative fights.\"[56]\nIn 2003, while Cruz was Texas Solicitor General, the Texas Attorney General's office declined to defend Texas's sodomy law in Lawrence v. Texas, in which the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that state laws banning homosexual sex were unconstitutional.[57]\nIn the landmark case of District of Columbia v. Heller, Cruz drafted the amicus brief signed by the attorneys general of 31 states arguing that the Washington, D.C. handgun ban should be struck down as infringing upon the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms.[55][58] He also presented oral argument for the amici states in the companion case to Heller before the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.[55][59]\nCruz successfully defended the constitutionality of the Ten Commandments monument on the Texas State Capitol grounds before the Fifth Circuit and the U.S. Supreme Court, winning 5–4 in Van Orden v. Perry.[42][46][55]\nIn 2004, Cruz was involved in the high-profile case surrounding a challenge to the constitutionality of public schools' requiring students to recite the Pledge of Allegiance (including the words \"under God\", legally a part of the Pledge since 1954), Elk Grove Unified School District v. Newdow.[42][46] He wrote a brief on behalf of all 50 states that argued that the plaintiff, a non-custodial parent, did not have standing to file suit on his daughter's behalf.[60] The Supreme Court upheld the position of Cruz's brief.[61]\nCruz served as lead counsel for the state and successfully defended the multiple litigation challenges to the 2003 Texas congressional redistricting plan in state and federal district courts and before the U.S. Supreme Court, which was decided 5–4 in his favor in League of United Latin American Citizens v. Perry.[46][62]\nIn Medellin v. Texas, Cruz successfully defended Texas against an attempt to reopen the cases of 51 Mexican nationals, all of whom were convicted of murder in the United States and on death row.[42][46][48][55] With the support of the George W. Bush Administration, the petitioners argued that the United States had violated the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations by failing to notify the convicted nationals of their opportunity to receive legal aid from the Mexican consulate.[50][63] They based their case on a decision of the International Court of Justice in the Avena case, which ruled that by failing to allow access to the Mexican consulate, the United States had breached its obligations under the Convention.[64] Texas won the case in a 6–3 decision, the Supreme Court holding that ICJ decisions were not binding in domestic law and that the President had no power to enforce them.[50][63]\nMichael Wayne Haley was arrested for stealing a calculator from Walmart in 1997.[65] Because of Haley's previous criminal convictions, he was sentenced to 16-and-a-half years in prison under the Texas habitual offender law. After Haley had exhausted his appeals, it became known that Haley's robbery offense occurred three days before one of his other convictions was finalized; this raised a question about the applicability of the habitual offender statute in his case. As Solicitor General, Cruz declined to vacate Haley's sentence, saying \"I think justice is being done because he had a full and fair trial and an opportunity to raise his errors.\"[66] The Supreme Court later remanded the case to lower courts based on Haley's ineffective assistance of counsel claim. During oral argument, Cruz conceded that Haley had a very strong argument for ineffective assistance of counsel since Haley's attorney failed to recognize the sentencing error and that he would not move to have Haley re-incarcerated during the appeal process.[66] After remand, Haley was re-sentenced to \"time served\".[67]\nIn 2008 American Lawyer magazine named Cruz one of the 50 Best Litigators under 45 in America,[54][68] and The National Law Journal named him one of the 50 Most Influential Minority Lawyers in America.[69][70] In 2010 Texas Lawyer named him one of the 25 Greatest Texas Lawyers of the Past Quarter Century.[71][72]\nAfter leaving the Solicitor General position in 2008, Cruz worked in a private law firm in Houston, Morgan, Lewis & Bockius LLP, often representing corporate clients, until he was sworn in as U.S. senator from Texas in 2013.[11][46][73] At Morgan Lewis, he led the firm's U.S. Supreme Court and national appellate litigation practice.[73] In 2010, he abandoned a bid for state attorney general when incumbent Attorney General Greg Abbott, who hired Cruz as Solicitor General, decided to run for reelection.[16]\nAt Morgan, Lewis & Bockius, Cruz represented Pfizer in a lawsuit brought by a group of public hospitals and community health centers, who accused Pfizer of overcharging.[74] Shandong Linglong Rubber Company was found guilty of marketing versions of tires that were based on blueprints stolen by a former employee of a Florida businessman and ordered to pay $26 million to the Floridian. Cruz worked on the Chinese company's appellant brief. The appeals court denied the appeal and affirmed the jury's award.[75] Cruz represented drug manufacturer B. Braun Medical Inc. in front of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit after the company was found guilty of wrongfully discharging a former employee. Cruz asserted that she had failed to prove that B. Braun had directed her to violate the law and that she had not presented sufficient evidence that her refusal to violate the law was why she had been fired. The appeals court rejected Cruz's argument and affirmed the $880,000 award.[75] Cruz represented Toyota in an appeal to the Texas Supreme Court in a statute of limitations case, where a judge wanted to investigate Toyota for contempt after a former Toyota in-house lawyer accused Toyota of unlawfully withholding documents in a product liability case.[76] Cruz unsuccessfully argued the judge's jurisdiction expired 30 days after the case was dismissed following an out-of-court settlement, but later won a second appeal using the same argument.[77]\nCruz defended two record-setting $54-million personal injury awards in New Mexico at the appellate level, including one that had been thrown out by a lower court.[78] He represented a mentally disabled man who was allegedly raped by an employee of the facility where he lived, and the family of a 78-year-old resident of an Albuquerque nursing home who died of internal bleeding.[78][79] The settlements were sealed in both cases.[78][79]\nCruz ran as a Tea Party candidate in the 2012 Republican primary,[80][81][82] and The Washington Post called his victory \"the biggest upset of 2012 ... a true grassroots victory against very long odds\".[83]\nOn January 19, 2011, after U.S. Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison said she would not seek reelection, Cruz launched his campaign via a blogger conference call.[84] In the Republican primary, he ran against sitting Lieutenant Governor David Dewhurst. Cruz was endorsed first by former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin[85] and then by the Club for Growth, a fiscally conservative political action committee;[86] Erick Erickson, former editor of prominent conservative blog RedState;[87] the FreedomWorks for America super PAC;[88] nationally syndicated radio host Mark Levin;[89] Tea Party Express;[90] Young Conservatives of Texas;[91] and U.S. Senators Tom Coburn, Jim DeMint,[92] Mike Lee,[93] Rand Paul[94] and Pat Toomey.[95] He was also endorsed by former Texas Congressman Ron Paul,[96] George P. Bush,[53] and former U.S. senator from Pennsylvania Rick Santorum.[97] Former Attorney General Ed Meese served as national chairman of Cruz's campaign.[53]\nCruz won the runoff for the Republican nomination by a 14-point margin over Dewhurst, support for Dewhurst having plummeted while Cruz's vote total dramatically increased from the first round.[98] Cruz won despite being outspent by Dewhurst, who held a statewide elected office,[99] $19 million to $7 million.[99][100]\nIn the November 6 general election, Cruz faced Democratic nominee Paul Sadler, an attorney and a former state representative from Henderson, in east Texas. Cruz won with 4.5 million votes (56.4%) to Sadler's 3.2 million (40.6%). Two minor candidates garnered the remaining 3% of the vote.[101] According to a poll by Cruz's pollster Wilson Perkins Allen Opinion Research, Cruz received 40% of the Hispanic vote, outperforming Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney among Hispanics in Texas.[102][103]\nAfter Time magazine reported that Cruz might have violated ethics rules by failing to publicly disclose his financial relationship with Caribbean Equity Partners Investment Holdings during the 2012 campaign, he said his failure to disclose the connection was inadvertent.[104]\nIn January 2016, The New York Times reported that Cruz and his wife had taken out nearly $1 million in low-interest loans from Goldman Sachs (where she worked) and Citibank, and failed to report them on Federal Election Commission disclosure statements as required by law.[105] Cruz disclosed the loans on his Senate financial disclosure forms in July 2012, but not on the FEC form.[106] There is no indication that Cruz's wife had any role in providing any of the loans, or that the banks did anything wrong.[106] The loans were largely repaid by later campaign fundraising. A spokesperson for Cruz said his failure to report the loans to the FEC was \"inadvertent\" and that he would file supplementary paperwork.[105]\nAs of November 2018, Cruz has sponsored 105 bills of his own, including:[107]\nCruz had a leading role in the October 2013 government shutdown.[108][109][110][111][112] Cruz gave a 21-hour Senate speech in an effort to hold up a federal budget bill and thereby defund the Affordable Care Act.[111][113][114] Cruz persuaded the House of Representatives and House Speaker John Boehner to include an ACA defunding provision in the bill.[112] In the U.S. Senate, former Majority Leader Harry Reid blocked the filibuster attempt because only 18 Republican Senators supported the filibuster.[112] During the filibuster he read Green Eggs and Ham by Dr. Seuss.[115] To supporters, the move \"signaled the depth of Cruz's commitment to rein in government\".[111] This move was extremely popular among Cruz supporters, with Rick Manning of Americans for Limited Government naming Cruz \"2013 Person of the Year\" in an op-ed in The Hill, primarily for his filibuster against the Affordable Care Act.[116] Cruz was also named \"2013 Man of the Year\" by conservative publications TheBlaze,[117] and The American Spectator,[118] \"2013 Conservative of the Year\" by Townhall.com,[119] and \"2013 Statesman of the Year\" by the Republican Party of Sarasota County, Florida.[120][121] He was a finalist for Time magazine's \"Person of the Year\" in 2013.[122] To critics, including some Republican colleagues[112] such as Senator Lindsey Graham, the move was ineffective.[111]\nCruz has consistently denied any involvement in the 2013 government shutdown, even though he cast several votes to prolong it and was blamed by many within his own party for prompting it.[123][124]\nOn April 1, 2014, Cruz introduced S. 2195, a bill that would allow the President of the United States to deny visas to any ambassador to the United Nations who has been found to have been engaged in espionage or terrorist activity against the United States or its allies and may pose a threat to U.S. national security interests.[125] The bill was written in response to Iran's choice of Hamid Aboutalebi as its ambassador to the UN.[126] Aboutalebi was involved in the Iran hostage crisis, in which of a number of American diplomats from the US embassy in Tehran were held captive in 1979.[126][127][128]\nUnder the headline \"A bipartisan message to Iran\", Cruz thanked President Barack Obama for signing S. 2195 into law. The letter, published in the magazine Politico on April 18, 2014, starts with \"Thanks to President Obama for joining a unanimous Congress and signing S. 2195 into law\". Cruz also thanked senators from both political parties for \"swiftly passing this legislation and sending it to the White House\".[129][130][131]\nIn his first two years in the Senate, Cruz attended 17 of 50 public Armed Services Committee hearings, 3 of 25 Commerce Committee hearings, and 4 of the 12 Judiciary Committee hearings, and he missed 21 of 135 roll call votes during the first three months of 2015.[132]\nIn a November 2014 Senate speech, Cruz accused the president of being \"openly desirous to destroy the Constitution and this Republic\".[133] In the same speech, Cruz invoked the speeches of the ancient Roman senator Cicero against Catiline to denounce Obama's planned executive actions on immigration reform.[133] Classics Professor Jesse Weiner, writing in The Atlantic, said that Cruz's analogy was \"deeply disquieting\" because \"In casting Obama in the role of Catiline, Cruz unsubtly suggests that the sitting president was not lawfully elected and is the perpetrator of a violent insurrection to overthrow the government ... In effect, he accuses the president of high treason. Regardless of one's views on immigration reform and the Obama administration at large, this is dangerous rhetoric.\"[133]\nCruz has repeatedly said that the 2015 international nuclear agreement with Iran \"will make the Obama administration the world's leading financier of radical Islamic terrorism\".[134] In response, Obama called Cruz's statements an example of \"outrageous attacks\" from Republican critics that crossed the line of responsible discourse: \"We've had a sitting senator, who also happens to be running for President, suggest that I'm the leading state sponsor of terrorism. Maybe this is just an effort to push Mr. Trump out of the headlines, but it's not the kind of leadership that is needed for America right now.\"[134] Former Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney also criticized Cruz's remarks, writing that although he, too, opposed the Iran agreement, Cruz's statement connecting Obama to terrorism was \"way over the line\" and \"hurts the cause\".[135][136]\nAfter the death of Associate Justice Antonin Scalia, Cruz said that the winner of the 2016 U.S. presidential election, rather than Obama, should appoint a new Justice.[137] In June 2016, Cruz blamed the Obama administration for the Orlando nightclub shooting, reasoning that it did not track the perpetrator Omar Mateen properly while he was on the terrorist watch-list.[138] Following the terrorist attack on Nice, France, Cruz said in a statement that the country was at risk as a result of the Obama administration having a \"willful blindness\" to radical Islamists.[139] With the passing of Fidel Castro in November, Cruz charged Obama with celebrating and lionizing Castro in public statements he made addressing the death.[140] On December 28, after Secretary of State John Kerry gave a speech defending the U.S.'s decision to allow a U.N. resolution to pass that condemned Israeli settlements \"on land meant to be part of a future Palestinian state\", Cruz denounced the speech as \"disgraceful\", and said that history would remember Obama and Kerry as \"relentless enemies of Israel\". Cruz also accused the Obama administration of having a \"radical anti-Israel agenda\".[141]\nCruz was one of Donald Trump's most vocal critics during the 2016 presidential campaign, with the two often exchanging heated comments directed at each other, and Cruz's family.[142] But he became an important ally of Trump's in the Senate.[143][144]\nIn late January 2017, Cruz praised Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch as \"brilliant and immensely talented\" in a written statement.[145] On February 23, while speaking at the 2017 CPAC, Cruz showed interest in Trump's nomination of a young justice in the mold of Scalia and Clarence Thomas.[146] On March 1, he called Trump's joint address to Congress the previous day \"positive\" and \"unifying\".[147] Cruz said that during his visit to the Mar-a-Lago estate on March 18, he spoke with affiliates of Trump while negotiating the American Health Care Act.[148] On April 6, shortly after the Shayrat missile strike, he released a statement displaying his interest in having Trump appeal to Congress to take \"military action in Syria\" to prevent Islamic terrorists from acquiring weapons stored in Syria.[149]\nIn April 2018, in the copy accompanying Trump's entry on the Time 100 most influential people of 2017, Cruz wrote, \"President Trump is doing what he was elected to do: disrupt the status quo.\"[150] Cruz's authorship was criticized by Charles Pierce of Esquire,[151] Jay Willis of GQ,[152] and CNN's Chris Cillizza.[150]\nCruz has used harsh rhetoric against fellow Republican politicians, and his relationships with various Republican members of Congress have been strained.[153][154] In 2013, he called Republicans he considered insufficiently resistant to Obama's proposals a \"surrender caucus\".[153] He also called fellow Republicans \"squishes\" on gun-control issues during a Tea Party rally.[153] Cruz's role in the United States federal government shutdown of 2013 in particular attracted criticism from a number of Republican colleagues.[154] Republican Senator John McCain was reported to have particularly disliked Cruz; in a Senate floor speech in 2013, McCain denounced Cruz's reference to Nazis when discussing the Affordable Care Act.[154] In March 2013, McCain also called Cruz and others \"wacko birds\" whose beliefs are not \"reflective of the views of the majority of Republicans\".[154] During the 2016 Republican presidential primaries, John Boehner described Cruz as \"Lucifer in the flesh\";[155] in an interview, Lindsey Graham said, \"If you killed Ted Cruz on the floor of the Senate, and the trial was in the Senate, nobody would convict you.\"[156]\nIn a heated Senate floor speech in July 2015, Cruz accused Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell of telling \"a flat-out lie\" over his intentions to reauthorize the Export-Import Bank of the United States, which Cruz opposes. \"What we just saw today was an absolute demonstration that not only what he told every Republican senator, but what he told the press over and over and over again was a simple lie\", Cruz said.[157] His \"incendiary outburst\" was \"unusual in the cordial atmosphere of the Senate\", according to Reuters.[157][158] In the same speech, Cruz assailed the \"Republican majority in both houses of Congresses\" for what he called an insufficiently conservative record.[158] His speech, and especially his accusation against McConnell, was condemned by various senior Republican senators, with McCain saying that the speech was \"outside the realm of Senate behavior\" and \"a very wrong thing to do\".[159] Orrin Hatch expressed a similar opinion: \"I don't condone the use of that kind of language against another senator unless they can show definitive proof that there was a lie ... And I know the leader didn't lie.\"[160] Cruz alleged that McConnell scheduled a vote on the Ex-Im Bank as part of a deal to persuade Democrats like Maria Cantwell to stop blocking a trade bill; McConnell denied there was any \"deal\", and that denial was what Cruz called a \"lie\". Hatch said McConnell did pledge to help Cantwell get a vote on the Ex-Im Bank.[161]\nAmong Cruz's few close allies in the Senate is Mike Lee of Utah.[162][163] Cruz has expressed pride in his reputation for having few allies, saying in June 2015 that he has been vilified for fighting \"the Washington cartel\".[164]\nWhen Boehner resigned from the House in September 2015, Cruz expressed his concern that before resigning Boehner might have \"cut a deal with Nancy Pelosi to fund the Obama administration for the rest of its tenure\".[165] The next month, the budget agreement passed in the House by a vote of 266 to 187, with unanimous support from Democrats and Boehner, lifting the debt ceiling through March 2017. Cruz called the agreement \"complete and utter surrender\".[166]\nCruz is one of the Senate Republicans in favor of the \"nuclear option\", \"to speed up consideration of President Trump's nominees\". Changing the Senate's rules to a simple majority vote would \"ensure a quicker pace on Trump's court picks\".[167]\nCruz ran for reelection to a second term in 2018.[168] The primary elections for both parties were held on March 6, 2018,[169] and he easily won the Republican nomination with over 80% of the vote.\nCruz faced the Democratic nominee, U.S. Representative Beto O'Rourke, in the general election.[170] The contest was unusually competitive for an election in Texas, with most polls showing Cruz only slightly ahead. The race received significant media attention[171] and became the most expensive U.S. Senate election in history up to that point[172] (until the 2020–21 Georgia special election between incumbent Kelly Loeffler and Raphael Warnock).\nOn November 6, 2018, Cruz defeated O'Rourke by a slim margin, 50.9% to 48.3%.[173]\nIn September 2020, Trump included Cruz on a shortlist, alongside fellow Senators Tom Cotton and Josh Hawley, for possible appointment to the Supreme Court. Cruz declined consideration for the position.[174]\nCruz backed a failed appeal to the United States Supreme Court attempting to overturn or nullify the 2020 presidential election in Pennsylvania filed by U.S. Representative Mike Kelly, which argued that the Pennsylvania Constitution requires in-person voting except in narrow and defined circumstances; the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania had already rejected this argument.[175][176][177] The U.S. Supreme Court declined to take up the case or issue an injunction and Pennsylvania's Electoral College votes were cast for Joe Biden.[178] Cruz later led an effort by a group of Republican senators to refuse to count Pennsylvania's Electoral College votes,[179][180] citing baseless allegations of fraud.[181]\nOn January 6, 2021, during the debate about whether Congress should accept Arizona's electoral votes, Cruz said that 39 percent of Americans believed the 2020 presidential election was rigged, but that \"I am not arguing for setting aside the result of this election\".[182] Some observers think Cruz knew claims about fraud in the election were inaccurate and that this speech and his earlier statements were attempts to mislead for political gain.[182] (There are also concerns that he misrepresented the percentage of those concerned about rigging, with the correct proportion being 28%.)[183][184]\nCongress's counting of the Electoral College votes was interrupted by an insurrectionist mob that stormed the United States Capitol after a rally near the White House. The attack on the Capitol resulted in the deaths of five people, including a police officer.[185]\nWhen Congress reconvened that evening to continue the count, Cruz voted in support of the objections to Arizona's and Pennsylvania's electoral votes.[186] The Senate rejected these objections by 93–6 and 92–7, respectively.[187] The Texas Democratic Party called on Cruz to resign, saying that his efforts to block Joe Biden's lawful victory empowered the Trump supporters who stormed the Capitol.[188] The Texas Democratic Party also called on the U.S. Department of Justice to open an official investigation into Cruz for inciting sedition and treason.[189][190][191] The Houston Chronicle called for Cruz to resign.[192] The San Antonio Express News called for Cruz to be expelled from the Senate.[193] Thousands of lawyers and law students called for him to be disbarred for inciting the insurrection.[194] President-elect Joe Biden and Republican senator Pat Toomey both said Cruz was complicit in the 'big lie' of Trump's allegations of voter fraud.[195] Republican operative Chad Sweet, the chair of Cruz's 2016 presidential campaign, denounced Cruz for \"assault on our democracy.\"[196] Several corporations halted donations to Cruz and other Republicans who voted to overturn the election based on Trump's false claims.[197][198][2] Lauren Blair Bianchi, Cruz′s communications director, resigned.[199]\nOn May 28, 2021, Cruz voted against creating an independent commission to investigate the riot.[200]\nIn February 2021, during a historic winter storm, up to 4.3 million Texas residents were left without power and millions of others without drinking water, including Cruz and his family. In the middle of the storm, Cruz and his family were spotted on a plane heading to Cancún, Mexico, where they planned to stay at the luxury Ritz Carlton hotel and escape their home, which Heidi Cruz called in a text message \"FREEZING\".[201][202][203] Cruz requested that the Houston police escort him and his family through the airport.[204]\nCruz left the family poodle Snowflake alone inside the house without heat; reporters saw the dog through the window of the front door of the dark and empty house.[205] Later, a self-identified security guard told a reporter he was caring for the dog.[206]\nCruz's political allies and rivals condemned him for leaving Texas during a crisis and traveling internationally during the COVID-19 pandemic.[201] Cruz initially said he was taking his daughters on a weeklong vacation from school at their request, in an attempt to be a \"good dad\".[207] Later that day, he returned to Texas, after allowing his family to stay in Mexico, saying that the vacation was a mistake.[208] Protesters calling for his resignation greeted him in front of his house upon his return.[209] After returning from Cancún, Cruz volunteered in Houston to help with recovery efforts.[210]\nAs early as 2013, Cruz was widely expected to run for the presidency in 2016.[211][212][213] On March 14, 2013, he gave the keynote speech at the annual Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in Washington DC.[214] He tied for 7th place in the 2013 CPAC straw poll on March 16, winning 4% of the votes cast.[215] In October 2013, Cruz won the Values Voter Summit presidential straw poll with 42% of the vote.[216] Cruz finished first in two presidential straw polls conducted in 2014 with 30.33% of the vote at the Republican Leadership Conference[217] and 43% of the vote at the Republican Party of Texas state convention.[218]\nCruz did speaking events in mid-2013 across Iowa, New Hampshire, and South Carolina, all early primary states, leading to further speculation that he was laying the groundwork for a 2016 bid.[219] Legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin described Cruz as the first potential presidential candidate to emphasize originalism as a major national issue.[50]\nOn April 12, 2014, Cruz spoke at the Freedom Summit, an event organized by Americans for Prosperity and Citizens United.[220] The event was attended by several potential presidential candidates.[221] In his speech, Cruz mentioned that Latinos, young people and single mothers are the people most affected by the recession, and that the Republican Party should make outreach efforts to these constituents. He also said that the words \"growth and opportunity\" should be tattooed on the hands of every Republican politician.[220]\nCruz delivered one of many State of the Union responses in January 2015.[222]\nOn March 23, 2015, Cruz started his 2016 presidential campaign for the Republican primaries and caucuses, in a morning speech delivered at Liberty University in Lynchburg, Virginia.[223] Also, at the same hour, he posted on his Twitter page: \"I'm running for President and I hope to earn your support!\"[224] He was the first major Republican presidential candidate for the 2016 campaign.[225][226] During the primary campaign, his base of support was mainly among social conservatives, though he had crossover appeal to other factions within his party, including in particular libertarian conservatives.[227][228]\nHarperCollins published Cruz's book A Time for Truth: Reigniting the Promise of America on June 30, 2015.[229] The book reached the bestseller list of several organizations in its first week of release.[230][231]\nIn the 2016 Republican presidential primaries, Cruz received over 7.8 million votes,[232][233] won 12 states, and earned 559 delegates.[234] He raised nearly $92 million, a record for a Republican primary candidate, much of it from small online donors. The Cruz campaign had more than 325,000 volunteers.[235]\nOn February 1, 2016, Cruz won the Iowa caucuses.[236] The Iowa win made him the first Hispanic to win either a presidential primary election or caucus.[236][237][238] He received 28% of the vote.[238] On February 10, 2016, Cruz placed third in the New Hampshire primary, with about 12% of the vote.[239] On February 21, 2016, he placed third in the South Carolina Republican primary with about 22.3% of the vote.[240]\nOn March 1, 2016, Super Tuesday, Cruz won Texas by 17%, along with Alaska and Oklahoma, providing him with four state primary victories total.[241] In the Texas primary, he received the most votes in all but six of the state's 254 counties.[242] On March 5, 2016, Cruz won the Kansas and Maine caucuses, giving him six statewide wins.[243][244][245]\nCruz won his widest margin up to that point in Kansas, where he beat frontrunner Donald Trump by 25 points.[246] With his victories over Trump in Texas, Kansas, and Maine, he established himself as the candidate with the best opportunity to defeat Trump, the leading contender for the nomination.[247][248]\nOn March 8, 2016, Cruz won the Idaho primary with 45% of vote—defeating Trump by 17% and earning his seventh statewide victory.[249] He placed second in Michigan, Mississippi, and Hawaii.[249] On March 12, 2016, Cruz won the Wyoming county conventions with 67% of the vote and 9 delegates, giving him his eighth statewide win.[250] On March 22, Cruz won the Utah Caucus with 69.2% of the vote, versus John Kasich with 16.8% and Trump with 14%.[251] Because he surpassed the 50% winner-take-all threshold, he won all 40 of Utah's delegates. This win was his ninth. On April 3, 2016, North Dakota elected a slate of delegates dominated by pro-Cruz delegates. Cruz received the support of the majority of the delegates.[252]\nOn April 6, 2016, Cruz won the Wisconsin primary with 48.2% of the vote to Trump's 35.1%. It was Cruz's tenth statewide win. He won 36 of the 42 delegates available in Wisconsin. Trump received the other six. On April 2 and 7–9, 2016, Cruz swept the Colorado congressional district and state conventions, taking all 34 delegates.[253][254][255][256] This gave Cruz his eleventh state win. On April 16, 2016, Cruz won all 14 of Wyoming's at-large delegates in the state convention. This secured the majority of state delegates, giving Cruz his twelfth state win.[257] On April 27, 2016, Cruz said that, if he were selected as the party's nominee, he would choose former CEO of HP and fellow 2016 Republican presidential candidate Carly Fiorina as his vice-presidential running mate.[258] Shortly after losing overwhelmingly to Trump in the Indiana primary on May 3, 2016, Cruz officially suspended his campaign.[259]\nCruz has said that when he was a child, his mother told him that she would have to make an affirmative act to claim Canadian citizenship for him, so his family assumed that he did not hold Canadian citizenship.[260] In August 2013, after the Dallas Morning News pointed out that he had dual Canadian-American citizenship,[261][262] he applied to formally renounce his Canadian citizenship and ceased being a citizen of Canada on May 14, 2014.[260][263]\nSeveral lawsuits and ballot challenges asserting that Cruz is ineligible to become U.S. president have been filed.[264][265][266][267][268][269][270] No lawsuit or challenge has been successful, and in February 2016, the Illinois Board of Elections ruled in Cruz's favor, stating, \"The candidate is a natural born citizen by virtue of being born in Canada to his mother who was a U.S. citizen at the time of his birth.\"[271]\nShortly after the campaign's end, Cruz indicated that he would restart the bid if successful in the Nebraska primary,[272] which Trump instead won.[273]\nIn the months following, several publications noted that Cruz still had not endorsed Trump,[274][275] Cruz explaining in June that he was \"watching and assessing\" to determine if he would support him in the forthcoming general election.[276] On July 7, after a meeting with Trump, he confirmed that he would speak at the 2016 Republican National Convention.[277]\nIn his speech on July 20, the third day of the convention, Cruz congratulated Trump but did not endorse him. He instead told listeners to \"vote your conscience, vote for candidates up and down the ticket who you trust to defend our freedom and to be faithful to the Constitution\". The speech was met with boos and a negative reception among the crowd.[278] The following day at the Texas Republican delegation breakfast, Cruz defended his choice to not endorse Trump: \"I am not in the habit of supporting people who attack my wife and attack my father. That pledge was not a blanket commitment that if you go and slander and attack Heidi, that I'm going to nonetheless come like a servile puppy dog and say, 'Thank you very much for maligning my wife and maligning my father.'\"[279][280] On September 23, 2016, he publicly endorsed Trump for president.[281]\nOn October 10, following the 2005 audio recording of Trump being released and several Republicans retracting their endorsements, Cruz reaffirmed his support, calling Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton \"manifestly unfit to be president\".[282] On November 15, he met with President-elect Trump at Trump Tower in New York City. It had been reported that Trump was considering Cruz for the position of U.S. Attorney General, but the position went to Alabama Senator Jeff Sessions.[283] On November 28, in light of Trump showing a softer tone on his campaign promises, Cruz warned that justified backlash could ensue if he strayed from them.[284]\nCruz has been backed by the billionaire Mercer family, including Robert and his daughter Rebekah.[285]\nAccording to the Dutch political scientist Cas Mudde, Cruz is part of the \"radical right\" on the US political spectrum.[81] He has been characterized as staunchly conservative, a religious conservative, and anti-establishmentarian.[286][287][288]\nCruz is a critic of the rapprochement between Cuba and the United States, saying on Fox News in December 2014 that the thaw in relations was a \"manifestation of the failures of the Obama-Clinton-Kerry foreign policy\" that \"will be remembered as a tragic mistake\".[289]\nIn July 2018, Cruz spoke at the Rally for Religious Freedom in Asia. He said, \"It is a pleasure to be here and stand in solidarity for the men and women across this globe who have been persecuted by communists... We must stand united, in shining light, in highlighting heroism, in highlighting courage, in speaking out for those like my family, like so many millions across the globe who've seen the jackboot of communism firsthand.\"[290]\nCruz has called for an end to \"overcriminalization, harsh mandatory minimum sentences, and the demise of jury trials\".[291] He supports the death penalty.[292] In his 2012 Senate campaign, Cruz frequently mentioned his role as counsel for the State of Texas in Medellín v. Texas, a 2008 case in which the U.S. Supreme Court held that Texas has the right to ignore an order from the International Court of Justice directing the U.S. to review the convictions and sentences of dozens of Mexican nationals on death row.[293] He has called Medellín the most important case of his tenure as Texas solicitor general.[293]\nCruz is a gun rights supporter,[294] and opposes expanding gun control regulations.[295]\nIn an interview with radio host Hugh Hewitt discussing the attack that killed three people at a Planned Parenthood clinic in Colorado Springs, Cruz said that \"the simple and undeniable fact is the overwhelming majority of violent criminals are Democrats\", and claimed that Democrats are \"soft on crime\" because \"convicted felons tend to vote Democratic.\"[296]\nIn August 2015, in the wake of the ambush death of a Texas police officer who was gunned down while filling up at a gas station, Cruz said that police are \"feeling the assault from the President, from the top on down, as we see—whether it's in Ferguson or Baltimore, the response from senior officials, the President or the Attorney General, is to vilify law enforcement. That's wrong. It's fundamentally wrong. It's endangering all of our safety and security.\"[297]\nCruz opposes the legalization of marijuana, but believes it should be decided at the state level.[298] After Colorado legalized marijuana, he said, \"If the citizens of Colorado decide they want to go down that road, that's their prerogative. I personally don't agree with it, but that's their right.\"[299]\nCruz met with Alyssa Milano and Fred Guttenberg to discuss gun violence in the United States. Guttenberg said this was \"a really important day.\"[300]\nCruz has been described by the Cato Institute's Center for Trade Policy Studies as a \"free trader\"[301] and as a \"free-trade advocate\" by The Wall Street Journal.[302] In 2013, he proposed the abolition of the IRS and the implementation of a flat tax \"where the average American can fill out taxes on a postcard\".[303] Cruz is \"adamantly opposed to a higher minimum wage\".[304]\nCruz wants to decrease the size of the government significantly. In addition to eliminating the IRS as described above, he has promised to eliminate four other cabinet-level agencies: the Department of Energy, Department of Education, Department of Commerce, and Department of Housing and Urban Development.[305]\nCruz is a proponent of school choice[306] and opposes the Common Core State Standards Initiative.[307]\nCruz rejects the scientific consensus on climate change.[308][309] In March 2015, he said that some people are \"global warming alarmists\" and, citing satellite temperature measurements, said, contrary to NASA's analysis, that there had been no significant warming in 18 years.[309][310][311]\nCruz voted against the Water Resources Development Act of 2013 that would have created the National Endowment for the Oceans and authorized more than $26 billion in projects to be built by the Army Corps of Engineers, at least $16 billion of which would have come from federal taxpayers.[312][313] He voted against the bill because it neglected \"to reduce a substantial backlog of projects, to the detriment of projects with national implications, such as the Sabine–Neches Waterway\".[314] Cruz said the Corps' responsibilities were expanded without providing adequate measures for state participation.[314] Proponents of the bill argued that it would provide steady funding to support research and restoration projects, funded primarily by dedicating 12.5% of revenues from offshore energy development, including oil, gas, and renewable energy, through offshore lease sales and production based royalty payments, distributed through a competitive grant program.[315]\nIn 2017, Cruz was one of 22 senators to sign a letter[316] addressed to Trump urging him to withdraw from the Paris Agreement. According to the Center for Responsive Politics, Cruz has received more than $2.5 million in campaign contributions from oil, gas and coal interests since 2012.[317] He has a lifetime score of 3% on the National Environmental Scorecard of the League of Conservation Voters.[318]\nCruz is a supporter of TransCanada's Keystone XL Pipeline,[319] and following the Republican senate whip, was a cosponsor of legislation in support of the pipeline.[320]\nIn a 2014 opinion editorial in USA Today, Cruz wrote that auditing the Federal Reserve System was a top Republican priority in 2015 and that he supported legislation that would allow the Government Accountability Office to evaluate the Federal Reserve's monetary policy. Federal Reserve chairwoman Janet Yellen, whose confirmation Cruz tried to prevent, said in her confirmation hearing that she opposed any audit of the Federal Reserve and that \"for 50 years Congress has recognized that there should be an exception to GAO ability to audit the Fed to avoid any political interference in monetary policy.\"[321][322]\nIn 2015, Cruz voted for the USA Freedom Act, which reauthorized the USA Patriot Act but reformed some of its provisions.[323][324]\nCruz has been an adamant opponent of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, a 2015 international nuclear agreement with Iran negotiated by the U.S. and other world powers, calling it \"catastrophic\" and \"disastrous\".[325][326]\nIn 2013, Cruz said that the U.S. had no \"dog in the fight\" during the Syrian Civil War and that its armed forces should not serve as \"al-Qaeda's air force\".[327] In 2014, he criticized the Obama administration: \"The president's foreign policy team utterly missed the threat of ISIS, indeed, was working to arm Syrian rebels that were fighting side by side with ISIS\", calling ISIS \"the face of evil\". In a statement opposing U.S. intervention for regime change in Syria, Cruz said, \"If President Obama and Hillary Clinton and Sen. Rubio succeed in toppling [Syrian President Bashar] Assad, the result will be the radical Islamic terrorists will take over Syria, that Syria will be controlled by ISIS, and that is materially worse for U.S. national security interests.\"[328]\nIn September 2016, Cruz backed the Obama administration's plan to sell more than $1.15 billion worth of weapons to Saudi Arabia.[329]\nIn early January 2017, Cruz, Texas governor Greg Abbott and some others met with Taiwanese president Tsai Ing-wen. Cruz criticized the People's Republic of China after it reportedly made a statement asking members of Congress not to meet with Tsai.[330][331][332]\nOn January 5, 2017, Cruz voted in favor of a House resolution condemning UN Security Council Resolution 2334, which condemned Israeli settlement building in the occupied Palestinian territories as a violation of international law.[333]\nIn June 2017, Cruz co-sponsored the Israel Anti-Boycott Act (s. 720), which would make it a federal crime for Americans to encourage or participate in boycotts against Israel and Israeli settlements in the West Bank if protesting actions by the Israeli government.[334][335]\nIn August 2018, Cruz and 16 other lawmakers urged the Trump administration to impose sanctions under the Global Magnitsky Act against Chinese officials responsible for human rights abuses against the Uyghur Muslim minority in western China's Xinjiang region.[336] They wrote, \"The detention of as many as a million or more Uyghurs and other predominantly Muslim ethnic minorities in 'political reeducation' centers or camps requires a tough, targeted, and global response.\"[337]\nOn December 18, 2018, Cruz and Senator Tom Cotton put forth a resolution in the U.S. Senate urging the United States to affirm Israel's sovereignty over the Golan Heights.[338]\nCruz has called the Nord Stream II natural gas pipeline a threat to the security of Europe and the U.S. In December 2019 he and Senator Ron Johnson wrote a letter to Edward Heerema, the owner of the offshore pipe layer Allseas, to warn him of sanctions if Allseas did not suspend its work on the pipeline, which would deliver natural gas from Russia to Germany.[339] A few days later Allseas suspended the work.[340] In December 2020, the Russian pipelaying ship Akademik Cherskiy continued pipelaying.[341] In January, another pipelayer, Fortuna, joined forces with the Akademik Cherskiy to complete the pipeline.[342] On June 4, 2021, Putin announced that the pipelaying for first line of the Nord Stream 2 was fully completed. On June 10, the pipeline's sections were connected.[343] The laying of the second line was completed in September 2021.[344]\nA co-sponsor of the resolution to commemorate the Armenian genocide, Cruz said that while Turkey is a NATO ally, \"We should never be afraid to tell the truth, and alliances grounded in lies are themselves unsustainable.\"[345]\nAmerican video game company Activision Blizzard punished a Hong Kong-based professional gamer for supporting pro-democracy Hong Kong protests. Cruz accused Blizzard and Apple of censorship.[346] He co-signed a letter to Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick that read, \"As China amplifies its campaign of intimidation, you and your company must decide whether to look beyond the bottom line and promote American values—like freedom of speech and thought—or to give in to Beijing's demands in order to preserve market access.\"[347]\nBeginning during his time as a Dublin, California, city councilman, Eric Swalwell was targeted by a Chinese woman believed to be a clandestine officer of China's Ministry of State Security. Swalwell's general relationship with a suspected Chinese agent, Christine Fang, has been characterized as problematic, particularly given his high-profile role as a member of the House Intelligence Committee.[348] Cruz tweeted, \"More than once, I've said 'screw the Chinese communists'. Little did I know how closely Swalwell was listening.\"[349]\nIn October 2021, Cruz posted a tweet that was critical of Australia's Northern Territory's vaccine mandates.[350] Northern Territory chief minister Michael Gunner's response to the tweet went viral quickly, garnering almost universal support from Australians.[351][352][353][354]\nCruz was one of six Republican senators to vote against expanding the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act, which would allow the U.S. Justice Department to review hate crimes related to COVID-19 and establish an online database.[355][356]\nCruz was a vocal critic of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act passed under President Obama in 2010. During the first year of Trump's presidency, Cruz sponsored legislation to repeal the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, and was part of the group of 13 senators that drafted the unsuccessful 2017 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act replacement proposals of the AHCA.[357][358][359][360]\nIn 2013, Cruz voted against a bill to provide a package of federal aid to the Northern East Coast for recovery from Hurricane Sandy[361] because, he said, the bill was \"filled with unrelated pork\" and \"two-thirds of that bill had nothing to do with Sandy\". The Washington Post disputed this, writing that \"the bill was largely aimed at dealing with Sandy, along with relatively minor items to address other or future disasters.\"[362] The New York Times wrote that \"of 23 examples of extraneous spending that a spokesman for Mr. Cruz provided, all but one—$195 million in discretionary funds for the secretary of health and human services—were Sandy-related or sought to mitigate future storms, as the law required.\"[363]\nIn 2015, in the wake of severe flooding in Texas, Cruz supported federal aid funding; and in 2017, called for federal intervention as Hurricane Harvey approached the coast of Texas.[364]\nCruz took a \"hard-line stance\" on immigration issues during the 2014 border crisis[365] and opposes comprehensive immigration reform.[50][365] He advocates an increase from 65,000 to 325,000 annually in skilled foreign workers entering the United States using H-1B visas.[366] According to McClatchy, Cruz staked out \"hard-right immigration stances\" during his 2016 presidential campaign.[367]\nCruz opposes paths to citizenship for undocumented immigrants brought to the United States as children (so-called DREAMers).[368] In February 2018, he was the sole senator to oppose a Republican motion to begin debate on legislation intended to resolve the question of what to do with DREAMers.[369] He has called for the repeal of the clause of the 14th amendment that grants citizenship to those born in the United States.[370] He defends the Trump administration's policy of separating migrant children from their parents,[371][372] blaming the migrant parents for crossing the U.S. border to seek asylum and claiming that the Obama administration maintained a similar policy.[371][372]\nIn December 2020, Cruz blocked the Hong Kong People's Freedom and Choice Act, which would give Hong Kongers refugee status, citing the threat of spying by China. He said the law was an attempt by Democrats \"to advance their long-standing goals on changing immigration laws\".[373]\nDuring a May 2021 Senate Rules Committee hearing, Cruz falsely asserted that House Democrats had \"designed\" the For The People Act such that it \"directs\" people \"to break the law and register millions of people to vote who are not eligible to vote because they are not United States citizens\" and \"automatically registers to vote anyone who interacts with the government\" regardless of their immigration status. The bill repeatedly states only U.S. citizens would be permitted to register.[374]\nIn March 2016, about seven months before the forthcoming presidential election, Cruz argued the Senate should not consider Obama's nominee to the Supreme Court on the grounds that \"this should be a decision for the people. Let the election decide. If the Democrats want to replace this nominee, they need to win the election\". In September 2020, less than two months before the next presidential election, Cruz supported an immediate vote on Trump's nominee to fill the Supreme Court vacancy caused by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's death.[375]\nDuring Donald Trump's presidency, Cruz and fellow Texas Senator John Cornyn contributed to the appointment of multiple conservative judges to federal courts with jurisdiction over Texas.[376][377][378][379]\nCruz has criticized the U.S. military for becoming \"emasculated\" by its recruiting efforts, comparing those efforts unfavorably to the Russian military's.[380][381] He accused Democratic politicians of trying to transform \"the greatest military on earth\" into \"pansies\".[380] He has claimed the military is debilitated and its \"ability to project power and obtain air superiority is tragically anemic\".[382] Blaming \"bloated bureaucracy and social experiments\", Cruz has proposed reducing the size of the active duty military while increasing spending.[383]\nCruz opposes net neutrality—which prevents Internet service providers from deliberately blocking or slowing particular websites—arguing that the Internet economy has flourished in the United States simply because it has remained largely free from government regulation.[384] He has argued that net neutrality is the \"Obamacare for the internet\".[385][386] Cruz said that the Obama-era implementation of the principle of net neutrality had the \"end result\" of \"less broadband, less innovation, and less freedom for the American consumer\".[386] In December 2017, after the Republican-controlled Federal Communications Commission repealed net neutrality, he mocked supporters of net neutrality as \"snowflakes\" who were misled by \"online propaganda\".[387]\nCruz is strongly anti-abortion, but \"would allow the procedure...when a pregnancy endangers the mother's life\".[388][389] He is in favor of cutting federal funding to Planned Parenthood.[390]\nCruz opposes both same-sex marriage and civil unions.[391] In 2013, he said he wanted marriage to be legally defined as only \"between one man and one woman\",[392] but also said that the legality of same-sex marriage should be left to each state to decide.[393] In 2015, after the Supreme Court decision in Obergefell ruled same-sex marriage bans unconstitutional, he called the decision \"the \"very definition of tyranny\",[394] accused the court of judicial activism, and said it was \"among the darkest hours of our nation.\"[395] In 2017, the same day that an audio clip resurfaced of Alabama Judge Roy Moore calling Obergefell \"worse\" than the 1857 ruling that upheld slavery, Cruz endorsed Moore for U.S. Senate.[396]\nCruz compared the vandalism and destruction of monuments and memorials in the United States to the 2001 destruction of the giant Buddhas of Bamiyan by the Taliban.[397]\nCruz and Michael J. Knowles started a podcast, Verdict with Ted Cruz, on January 21, 2020. The first episodes were summaries of the impeachment hearings of Donald Trump. After the hearings ended the podcast expanded its content to include other topics and interviews, including with Washington politicians such as U.S. Senators Tim Scott, Lindsey Graham, and Mike Lee, Trump administration officials including White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows, then-U.S. Attorney General Bill Barr, U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos, and actors Jon Voight and Isaiah Washington.[398]\nCruz married Heidi Nelson on May 27, 2001;[399] they have two daughters, Caroline and Catherine.[400] The couple met when Cruz was working on George W. Bush's 2000 presidential campaign. Heidi took leave from her position as head of the Southwest Region in the Investment Management Division of Goldman, Sachs & Co. in 2016 to support Cruz's run for president.[401] She previously worked in the White House for Condoleezza Rice and in New York as an investment banker.[402] Cruz lives in River Oaks, Houston.[403]\nCruz has joked, \"I'm Cuban, Irish, and Italian, and yet somehow I ended up Southern Baptist.\"[404] He loves to wear cowboy boots, but he refrained from doing so when arguing before the Rehnquist court.[405]\nIn 2017, someone on Cruz's Twitter account \"liked\" a pornographic Twitter post. Shortly thereafter, a Cruz staffer undid the \"like\", but not before other Twitter users had taken screenshots of the post and circulated them widely online. Cruz said that the person who \"liked\" the post was a staffer of his.[406]\nAs of 2018, according to OpenSecrets.org, Cruz's net worth was more than $3.1 million.[407]\nOn March 8, 2020, Cruz took a temporary leave of absence from his Senate office[where?] due to concerns about his contact with a person infected with COVID-19 at the ACU's Conservative Political Action Conference. Staying at his home in Texas,[408] he avoided contact with colleagues and constituents for 14 days (believed to be the limit of the virus's incubation period). Cruz said he had been advised chances of his contracting the virus were very low.[409]\n2012\n2016\n2018",

            "report_content": "Our country faces serious challenges.\nWe have one in six Americans out of work, the highest poverty rate in 51 years, a sick economy, record home foreclosures, record deficits, rising debt. Most Americans believe we’re on the wrong track.\nToday millions of Americans fear that future generations will inherit a country that is worse off than the America they inherited.\nSince Nancy Pelosi became speaker of the House in 2007, we have lost more than 7 million jobs. In the nearly two years since Barack Obama became president, we have lost nearly 3 million jobs, in spite of spending a record $814 billion on an “economic stimulus” plan. Also, during the past year, unemployment has risen in every county across our Central Texas congressional district.\nTwenty-year Congressman Chet Edwards, D-Waco, has been a stalwart supporter of Obama and Pelosi and their job-killing agenda.\nWe remember February 2008, when Edwards stood on the Suspension Bridge in Waco and endorsed Obama for president, saying Obama had the “solid judgment our citizens want.” Edwards has also voted multiple times for Pelosi for speaker of the House. She even recommended him for vice president.\nWhen it comes to his voting record, Edwards is in line with Obama and Pelosi, not with our district. He votes with the Pelosi-Obama agenda over 96 percent of the time, in favor of every spending bill (and against nearly every spending cut), growing government, endless bailouts, record increases in the debt ceiling, irresponsible budgets and the failed stimulus bill.\nOur families cannot afford this agenda, nor can they afford Chet Edwards.\nIf I am elected, we will focus on private- sector job creation, helping our economy recover, and cutting federal spending. We must repeal ObamaCare, kill cap-and-trade for good, reduce spending to 2007-08 levels, and extend current tax rates permanently to prevent the largest tax increase in American history.\nIn this campaign, we have held more than 100 public events across the 12 counties of this district, answering every question and staying until the last person leaves. Contrast that with Edwards who has not held a public town hall meeting since summer 2009. He doesn’t want to hear from voters because he knows you’re deeply angry about his liberal voting record.\nInstead of talking about his record, Edwards has lashed out at me, making numerous false claims in negative ads. PolitiFact, an independent journalism organization, recently reviewed one of his attack ads and labeled it “false.” The ad claimed I helped run a company that laid off 3,000 workers. This is a deceitful, false and defamatory claim. I never worked for that company.\nAfter spending more than 30 years in business, I know how to create jobs, balance budgets, meet payrolls, and borrow and repay debt. It’s the kind of experience that the current Congress desperately needs and that Edwards clearly lacks.\nWe must end the out-of-control Obama-Pelosi-Edwards agenda; and, if we elect 40-60 conservative congressmen in November, we will provide a check on the Obama White House.\nI am running for Congress because I fear for the future of our country. I promise you that I will take my experience and my principles to Congress to fix the mess we are in and then come home — just as our nation’s Founders intended.\nI refuse to be part of the first generation of Americans to pass on a country to future generations with fewer opportunities than what we were given.\nIt is time that we returned to conservative principles: limited government, free-market economics, common-sense social values and adherence to the U.S. Constitution.\nWe can turn things around but we must win in November. Join with me to restore America’s promise, prosperity and security for our children and grandchildren. I would be honored to have your support and your vote in this very important election.\nBill Flores is a retired businessman from Bryan and the Republican nominee for Congress in Texas’ 17th Congressional District.\nGet opinion pieces, letters and editorials sent directly to your inbox weekly!\nGet up-to-the-minute news sent straight to your device.",
