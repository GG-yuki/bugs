            "report_content": "Scappoose, Ore.— Congresswoman Suzanne Bonamici (D-OR) today toured Hi-School Pharmacy in Scappoose to discuss her support for a reform that would cut as much as $156 billion from the deficit over the next ten years and save seniors up to $27 billion through reduced drug prices over the same time period.  The change would require the Secretary of Health and Human Services to negotiate prescription drug prices on behalf of Medicare Part D beneficiaries. The program, which serves 28 million seniors, has been barred from negotiating rates with the pharmaceutical industry since 2004.\n“If we lift the ban on allowing Medicare to negotiate prescription drug prices, we would cut our deficit by as much as $156 billion over 10 years,” said Bonamici. “This simple reform would also cut costs for seniors, and help us to avoid cuts in other places like education. The Department of Veterans Affairs has been negotiating prices for years and it’s saved taxpayers billions of dollars.”\nPrice negotiation has a history of saving money. The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has reduced costs significantly by negotiating rates. One Families USA report found that the top five Medicare Part D insurers charged prices 58 percent higher than the VA for 20 commonly prescribed drugs.\nBonamici also highlighted her support for a reform that would allow small community pharmacies to remain competitive against larger pharmacies in Medicare Part D’s new preferred pharmacy networks. Most preferred network plans do not allow independently owned pharmacies to participate. The policy has the unintended effect of forcing seniors to travel great distances to access lower co-pays at preferred pharmacies. Bonamici says Medicare should develop a plan to alleviate this problem.\n“It’s getting harder and harder for community pharmacies to compete against the larger chains,” Jack Holt, owner of Hi-School Pharmacy, said. “We’re often excluded from Medicare’s preferred pharmacy networks, and that’s forcing many of our longtime customers to travel longer distances to access lower prices. We’ve always been a strong, affordable option for seniors and we would like to keep it that way. We just want a level playing field so that we can continue to be the face of neighborhood healthcare.”\n###\nPhone: (202) 225-0855\n\tFax: (202) 225-9497\nPhone: (503) 469-6010\n\tFax: (503) 469-6018",

            "report_content": "Congresswoman Suzanne Bonamici visited Hi-School Pharmacy in Scappoose Wednesday, March 27, to show support for community pharmacies and discuss Medicare reforms.\n“If we can save money for our seniors, we should be doing it,” Bonamici said as she walked into the small drug store with director and president of Hi-School Pharmacy, Jack Holt, and his vice president of operations, John Crawford.\nBonamici supports a reform she says could save up to $156 billion while lowering prescription drug prices for seniors by up to $27 billion. The reform would require price negotiations to be held by the Secretary of Health and Human Services on behalf of the Medicare Part D Program, which currently serves 28 million seniors.\nMedicare administrators have been barred from negotiating new rates with the pharmaceutical industry since 2004.\n“If we lift the ban on allowing Medicare to negotiate prescription drug prices, we would cut our deficit by as much as $156 billion over the next 10 years,” Bonamici said. “This simple reform would also cut costs for seniors and help us to avoid cuts in other places like education.”\nBonamici also highlighted support for a reform that would allow small community pharmacies to remain competitive against larger chains when providing affordable prescription drugs for seniors. Most preferred network plans under the Medicare Part D Program do not allow independently owned pharmacies to participate.\n“We’re often excluded from  Medicare’s preferred pharmacy networks, and that’s forcing many of our longtime customers to travel longer distances to access lower prices,” Holt said. “We’ve always been a strong, affordable option for seniors and we would like to keep it that way. We just want a level playing field so that we can continue to be the face of neighborhood healthcare.”\nHolt gave Bonamici a tour of the pharmacy and explained how the business operates. He also raised the issue of the high costs of some drugs. Different pharmaceutical companies sometimes require the pharmacy to pay more than what they can sell the product for, Holt explained.\n“I can’t name the company, because if I complain about the company, they’ll pull the drug,” Holt said. “The pricing plan can be different almost every time.”\nThe rising cost of pharmaceuticals is a result of products being produced by only one manufacturer; with no competitors, manufacturers can raise their prices, Holt said.\n“The worst thing—aside from losing money—is that I have no opportunity to keep people in the store,” he said.\nPortland Tribune Beaverton Valley Times  Tigard Tualatin Times  Lake Oswego Review  West Linn Tidings  Wilsonville Spokesman  Hillsboro Tribune  Forest Grove News Times  Newberg Graphic  Clackamas Review  Oregon City News  The Outlook  Sandy Post  Estacada News  Canby Herald  Woodburn Independent  Molalla Pioneer  Columbia County Spotlight  Regal Courier Sherwood Gazette The Bee Southwest Community Connection\nMadras Pioneer  Central Oregonian\nSubmit an Obituary\nColumns  Public Notices  Oregon Property Foreclosures Business Calendar  Business Leads  News Links  Plan Center  Marketing\nColumns  Public Notices  Oregon Property Foreclosures Business Calendar  Business Leads  News Links  Plan Center  Marketing\nPrinting and Distribution Services\nPublic Notices\nDigital Marketing Solutions\nSubmit an Obituary\nColumns  Public Notices  Oregon Property Foreclosures Business Calendar  Business Leads  News Links  Plan Center  Marketing\nColumns  Public Notices  Oregon Property Foreclosures Business Calendar  Business Leads  News Links  Plan Center  Marketing\nPrinting and Distribution Services\nPublic Notices\nDigital Marketing Solutions\nWeekly Ads This Week's Circulars Find your Next Vehicle  Special Sections  Insiders\nNews Tips Letters to the Editor  Births  | Anniversaries  | Weddings  | Engagements  | Business  | Birthday  | ObituariesCommunity Calendar\nWeekly Ads This Week's Circulars Find your Next Vehicle  Special Sections  Insiders\nNews Tips Letters to the Editor  Births  | Anniversaries  | Weddings  | Engagements  | Business  | Birthday  | ObituariesCommunity Calendar\nClick Here\nAdvertise with UsCurrent Job Openings\n© 2021 Pamplin Media Group | All rights reserved | 6605 SE Lake Rd, Portland, OR 97222 | 503-684-0360 | Privacy Policy  | Refund Policy",

            "report_content": "Forgot Password?\nDear Administrator Verma:\nWe write to express strong bipartisan support for the Medicare Advantage program, which 39.2 percent of eligible Medicare beneficiaries, more than 22 million people, choose to enroll in. We appreciate your ongoing commitment to preserving and strengthening the Medicare Advantage program for current and future Medicare beneficiaries. As the Administration considers updates to the program for plan year 2020, we urge you to ensure that the Medicare Advantage program will continue to offer affordable, high-quality, patient-centered coverage options.\nMillions of seniors depend on Medicare Advantage plans to provide comprehensive, affordable health care as they age. The success of the Medicare Advantage program is demonstrated by survey findings showing that more than 90 percent of beneficiaries report high satisfaction with their coverage.[1] In 2019, average premiums decreased by an estimated 6 percent while enrollment is projected to increase by almost 12 percent.[2] Further, the average number of plan choices has increased.\nMedicare Advantage offers care coordination, disease management programs, out-of-pocket spending limits, access to community-based programs, additional supplemental benefits such as vision and dental coverage, and often prescription drug coverage for no additional premium. Moreover, due to recent changes included in the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, an estimated 1.5 million beneficiaries will have access to expanded supplemental benefits such as adult day care services and in-home and caregiver support services. Other new flexibilities will foster greater competition and reduce costs for beneficiaries and taxpayers.\nFor plan year 2020, we urge the Administration to continue its efforts to promote flexibility and innovation, support value-based arrangements with health care providers, and ensure that any substantive changes to the Medicare Advantage program provide plan sponsors with sufficient time for thorough evaluation and implementation. We also encourage the Administration to build on the enhanced supplemental benefits that were offered this plan year by providing additional flexibility to help drive the next generation of innovative approaches in Medicare to improve health outcomes, while also maintaining robust beneficiary protections.\nWe look forward to continuing to work with you to further strengthen the Medicare Advantage program and ensure millions of seniors have access to comprehensive, affordable health coverage choices.\nSincerely,\nVote Smart's mission is to provide free, factual, unbiased information on candidates and elected officials to ALL Americans.\nREAD MORE\nAll content © 1992 - 2021 Vote Smart unless otherwise attributed - Privacy Policy\nLegislative demographic data provided by Aristotle International, Inc.",
