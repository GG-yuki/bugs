            "report_content": "To revisit this article, select My Account, then View saved stories\nTo revisit this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories\nBy Adam Gopnik\nPresident Obama’s decision that the federal government will now call what was formerly Mount McKinley, the continent’s highest peak, by its older, First Nations name of Denali, which means “The High One,” caused some hysteria this week, though mostly among the predictably hysterical. Part of it may have come from stripping away the prefatory article: from now on it’s not even Mount Denali, just Denali, causing in some the shock your parents felt when you explained that the band was not called “The Cream” but “Cream,” for God’s sake. Denali, to be sure, though itself an excellent rock-band name, has more of a seventies feeling—one expects a band called Denali to have a lead singer with a shaky falsetto, chirping songs of natural mysticism like, well, like the band called America.\nThe hysteria seems to have been the result of a suspicion that the new, or rather original, name was preferred because it was more “politically correct.” They’re just practicing identity politics at twenty thousand feet! the cry went up, amid accusations of kowtowing to the Yupik or Inuit or choosing a new name just because it’s the kind of thing people like that do. Let Obama rename a mountain, and the next thing you know he might do something really pernicious, like avoiding unnecessary wars or expanding health care for the helpless. And then there was the Internet rumor that “Denali” was the “Kenyan” word for black power (it isn’t), not to mention an anagram for “Denial,” presumably of our glorious imperial past. Rather tellingly silent throughout has been the half-termer herself, former Governor Sarah Palin, perhaps for the simple reason that she, too, appears to be part of this new plot against America, having called the mountain Denali, as Alaskans often do, even in her resignation speech.\nWeirdly, no one has mentioned the earlier occasion when the name of a liberal President was pushed off an entire peninsula and no one complained. In 1963, the Kennedy family apparently made the modest suggestion that a fitting tribute to the murdered President might be the Florida space center that he had done so much to bring into existence. L.B.J., with his usual Texan appetite for overcharge, caused the entire peninsula of Cape Canaveral to be renamed in J.F.K.’s honor, as Cape Kennedy. The earlier name was a popular one, though, and a mere decade later the state of Florida turned it back into Cape Canaveral. The federal authorities acquiesced, and the Kennedy family, and liberals generally, were properly quiet.\nThe truth is that the obsession with word magic and names is a primitive one, inherently irrational. Names are notional. A rose by any other name would smell as sweet—or as rancid, depending; a mountain by its older name is just as tall. Yet the desire to remedy the wrongs of the past by righting our nomenclature is a deep one, and it burns on. Word magic it may be, and no more than that, but we believe in magic, and we think in words. During and after the French Revolution, a flurry of renaming turned the Place Louis XV into the bloody Place de la Révolution and finally into the conciliatory Place de la Concorde, and the Place Royale into the mundane Place des Vosges (the Vosges being the department of France that most speedily paid Napoleon’s taxes). Big things have names that change as the people who own them change, too. The mountain we call Everest was named, in the nineteenth century, after a Welshman, though the Tibetan people had called it Chomolungma, “Mother Of The Universe.” (Weirdly, if the Welshman’s name were properly pronounced, it would be known as Eve-Rest, evoking the final resting place of the mother of us all, rather than the superlative form of “ever.”) In more recent decades, the Nepalese government, in what was in some measure an expression of nationalism, took up the Sanskrit name of Sagarm­atha for the peak.\nSome new names never catch on, while old names stick irrevocably, no matter what Presidents say or do. A sixteen-year-old girl who had passed most of her life in New York asked her father the other day to please explain why there were insignia medallions of Cuba and Canada on lower Sixth Avenue. From his own musty memories, he explained that the avenue was once named—was actually still named, though never called—the Avenue of the Americas, due to a bit of showy postwar politicking with Fiorello La Guardia (and Nelson Rockefeller leaning in) at the controls. (The dad was actually disappointed to learn that most of the medallions, once a bit of ornamental excess whose point was to be treated disdainfully, have vanished; they ought to be restored.)\nMost of the renamings of the past to suit the present are harmless, or silly, but some have an edgy and quarrelsome side. Andrew Jackson, Indian killer and hardened racist, gives his name and his face to the twenty-dollar bill. Should we obliterate his image from our money, as we have obliterated McKinley from the mountain? Should we rename every street, rededicate every monument, repurpose every President, to conform to our enlightenment?\nIt’s obvious—or it should be so—that we cannot rename and reorder all the remnants of the past according to the present’s pieties, for the simple reason that the present’s pieties will not be the pieties of the future. One of the many evils of ISIS and the Taliban is their desire to remake the past entirely in their own image; changing old names too casually is a more harmless form of blowing up Buddhas. Pluralism makes retrospective, historical demands as well as immediate ones. New York should not again become New Amsterdam, no matter how passionately any revanchist Dutch may feel about it.\nBut we can distinguish, simply enough, between the stubbornly recalcitrant parts of the past and those easily remedied—an Alaskan mountain with a fine and ancient native name has no need to bear that of an Ohio politician who was never anywhere near it. We are not insulting William McKinley, the former President, when we change it; we are honoring the mountain, and the first people who saw it often enough to love it.\nThere is, in general, an easy resolution to this problem of when we should adjust the past to the present, one neither “relativist” nor unduly pietist. We need ask merely, What was the most humane view being widely urged at the time, and does the name or people we honor celebrate that? Slavery is a good instance—there was absolutely no shortage of articulate and eloquent people for whom slavery was an absolute evil. Already in the mid-eighteenth century, long before the classic period of American abolitionism began, Samuel Johnson, the greatest conservative poet in the English language, was outspoken about the evils of slavery; he thought, with uncomfortable persuasiveness, that the American Revolution was stained beyond redemption by its hypocrisy on the subject. Those who stood and made the case for slavery, then and later, were not simply people of their time and temper. They were wrong, and were called so by the good people of the same time. When we honor them—say, on the side of a mountain in Georgia—we honor what everyone knew was wrong, or could have known.\nSo let us remove the wrong people’s names and pictures from our bills and byways, while remembering that we are, or will be, regarded as the wrong people ourselves in some way we cannot yet fully conceive—as we will be seen as better people than we know in some way that we do not yet fully recognize. (We now cherish the diets of nineteenth-century farm dwellers, though they merely mostly endured them.) Nothing depends on names. The rock will not get an inch taller or shorter or changed in nature depending on what we call it. If Ohioans want to keep calling it Mount McKinley, let them, and let them take a place of pride along with those who are fighting to keep Pluto called a planet. We are not slaves of our tongues. But we are citizens of our languages. Choosing names is a way of expressing emotions. The things of this world can exist with as many names as we choose to give them, and the biggest among them can take on many identities without getting any smaller.\nBy signing up, you agree to our User Agreement and Privacy Policy & Cookie Statement.\nThe ice-class bulk carrier Nordic Odyssey travels through the Northern Sea Route, which is becoming increasingly navigable as Arctic ice melts.\nBy Adam Gopnik\nBy John Luther Adams\nBy Saïd Sayrafiezadeh\nSections\nMore\n© 2021 Condé Nast.

            "report_content": "Conservatives reacted accordingly when the White House announced President Obama‘s plan to rename Mt. McKinley, named for President William McKinley, after its traditional Athabaskan name, “Denali.”\nMost of the criticism consisted of the usual accusations — Obama overstepping his power in the executive branch, ignoring the U.S. Congress (where a similar discussion has been ongoing for years), and a litany of other supposedly impeachable offenses.\nHowever, perhaps the most volatile — yet otherwise unsurprising — bit of flack came in the form of a rather misinformed meme. The meme claims that “Denali” is a Kenyan word for “black power”:\nAs the fact checkers over at Snopes were quick to point out, however, this is not the case for a variety of easily discernible reasons.\nCitizens of Kenya do not speak “Kenyan” because such a language does not exist. Instead, they either speak English or Swahili — the country’s two official languages. As for Kenya’s other 66 languages, one is dead, five are linguistic imports brought in by immigrants, and the rest mostly consist of east African tribal languages and pidgin dialects. None of these are called “Kenyan.”\nThe word “Denali” has no phonetic or semantic equivalent in any of these languages. Rather, it originates from North America, specifically the indigenous Athabaskan language of the region. The most common English translation is “the great one,” though the word famously has no hard-and-fast English referent. Even so, Alaskans have been calling Mt. McKinley by its older, traditional name for quite some time.\n“This name change recognizes the sacred status of Denali to many Alaska Natives,” U.S. Secretary of the Interior Sally Jewell said in a statement. “The name Denali has been official for use by the State of Alaska since 1975, but even more importantly, the mountain has been known as Denali for generations. With our own sense of reverence for this place, we are officially renaming the mountain Denali in recognition of the traditions of Alaska Natives and the strong support of the people of Alaska.”\nAnd perhaps that’s one of the more important glossed-over aspects of this whole silly debacle. For while conservative and social media commentators took great pleasure in blaming Obama directly for the official name change, it was actually Jewell’s doing. Secretarial Order No. 3337 was created, drafted and approved by Jewell’s office — it merely received the White House’s blessing.\nOr if you want to think about it linguistically, Jewell’s order was blessed by President Barack (Hebrew/Arabic roots meaning “blessed”) Obama.\n[h/t Eric Geller, Snopes]\n[Images via Shutterstock.com, Snopes]\n— —\n>> Follow Andrew Husband (@AndrewHusband) on Twitter\nHave a tip we should know? tips@mediaite.com\nHave a tip or story idea?

            "report_content": "(Photo: Taylor Swift)\nTaylor Swift's “Wildest Dreams” video is, as they say, problematic.\nThe problem is not that Taylor Swift’s video uses stereotypical images of Africa, though it certainly does tick off quite a few of Binyavanga Wainaina’s boxes. But if it were just that, it would be pretty unremarkable; stereotypes are, by definition, normal. Nor is the problem that the video uses the bodies of black people as props (as her video “Shake It Off” notoriously did). “Wildest Dreams” mostly doesn’t have any black people in it at all. There are a handful, but they aren’t even prominent enough to be objectified; if you blink, you’ll miss them:\nThat’s sort of the point: There are black people in this image of Africa, but they are in the background, serving. Otherwise, they are absent. This is Africa as a backdrop for white people taking selfies. This is Africa as white-supremacist fantasy, Africa as a romantic prop. After all, the video doesn’t show us “Africa” in any particular sense. It’s not set in Out of Africa’s Kenya, for example, or Botswana or Zimbabwe, or any other particular place; it’s set in “Africa,” timeless and placeless, an Africa that resembles the world of the Lion King more than anywhere real.\nAnd this is where the video’s cynicism is truly breathtaking: It doesn’t want the real thing; it wants the fantasy. “Wildest Dreams” (2015) is not set in Africa, but rather on the movie set of an imagined 1950 Hollywood film, Wildest Dreams.\nThis is why the video carefully shows the construction of a stereotypical image of Africa. We see the blazing African sun ... and then we see the movie lighting that is used to create the effect.\nWe see Swift posing next to a wild animal—CGI, of course—but her dress is not being blown back by the real African wind; it’s being held aloft by movie magic.\nWe see make-up being applied, as she sings the words “red lips and rosy cheeks,” and we see the fantasy break down, as the camera pulls back from this shot.\nAnd reveals that we aren’t even in Africa at all; we’re on a Hollywood sound-stage.\nThe fantasy on offer in this video, in other words, is not to actually be Karen Blixen, not to be the actual person who actually “had a farm in Africa” on whom Sydney Pollack’s Out of Africa was based. Swift’s video is a fantasy about being an actress, Meryl Streep, as she pretends to be Karen Blixen in Out of Africa (or Katherine Hepburn, or some other glamorous actress pretending to be in Africa). Swift doesn’t want to be in Africa in 1950 in other words; she wants to be an actress making a movie about being in Africa in 1950.\nThis may seem like a defense of the video. It isn’t, but I am saying something very similar to what the director of the video, Joseph Kahn, said in his defense of the video:\nThis is not a video about colonialism but a love story on the set of a period film crew in Africa, 1950. The video is based on classic Hollywood romances like Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton, as well as classic movies like the African Queen, Out of Africa, and the English Patient, to name a few.... There is no political agenda in the video. Our only goal was to tell a tragic love story in classic Hollywood iconography.\nThe things he says are completely true: The video is not “about” colonialism (or about Africa); it’s about the desire for “classic Hollywood iconography,” for the glamour of that period. Kahn uses the word “classic” three times. Because Swift’s video is “based on classic Hollywood romances,” he insists, it cannot be about colonialism. Because it uses “classic Hollywood iconography,” there can be “no political agenda in the video.” Because it’s a tragic love story, it is absolved of nostalgia for white supremacy.\nBut if the word “classic” is a load-bearing piece of rhetoric, the argument here is a load of crap. Another “classic” Hollywood film is 1915’s Birth of a Nation—an adaptation of Thomas Dixon’s The Clansman: An Historical Romance of the Ku Klux Klan—and the film’s success played a direct and decisive role in reviving the Ku Klux Klan, an organization that occasionally dabbled in politics. For decades, as black people struggled against Jim Crow repression and law-by-lynching, Hollywood films like Gone With the Wind (1939) produced very effective and powerful propaganda for a white supremacist vision of American society; Hollywood in the 1930s was, in everything but name, a public relations office for Jim Crow. But, and here is the point, Hollywood sold white supremacy by foregrounding white romance. Gone With the Wind is not about slavery, ostensibly; it’s about white people in love who just happen to own slaves. And it’s no coincidence that Birth of the Nation literally ends with voter suppression and white people getting married. The romance—the marriage between North and South—is there to make white supremacy look good, to make you forget little things like the fact that Black Lives Matter.\nLike Gone With the Wind, Taylor Swift’s “Wildest Dreams” is not explicitly nostalgic for white supremacy. But it’s nostalgic for a time when you could be nostalgic for white supremacy, when having a wedding at a former slave plantation raised no eyebrows. As in “Shake It Off,” Swift’s previous flirtation with white supremacy, the white fantasy that Swift is selling is the idea that you can play around with racism but not get your hands dirtied by it. You can have your racist cake and eat it too: you can smirk at a line of twerking black bodies, but if anyone criticizes you, you can just shake it off.\nThis is why Swift's video seems primarily nostalgic not for white supremacy, per se, but for a time and a place when you could be nostalgic for white supremacy: classic Hollywood. And, to be blunt, “classic” Hollywood was racist; it was, to paraphrase Taylor Swift, really bad (though it did it so well). The bigotry of early Hollywood found vocal critics at the time, of course; the NAACP mounted a public campaign against Birth of a Nation, and however mainstream the minstrelsy of movies like Gone With the Wind were (both literal and figurative blackface were mainstream, for a very long time), it was always political, always protested, always called out. And the classic defense was always precisely what Kahn says above—i.e., to maintain that Gone With the Wind is not a movie about slavery or white supremacy: no, it’s just a love story that happens to be set against the backdrop of the civil war.\nOne difference was that, in 1939, a film about the Old South could be openly and nakedly nostalgic for slavery days, as the movie’s opening card makes explicit:\nThere was a land of Cavaliers and Cotton Fields called the Old South.... Here in this pretty world Gallantry took its last bow.... Here was the last ever to be seen of Knights and their Ladies Fair, of Master and of Slave.... Look for it only in books, for it is no more than a dream remembered. A Civilization gone with the wind....\nIn 2015, it’s a little harder to be so openly and nakedly nostalgic for white supremacy, even if that's how you feel in your heart. It isn’t quite so sexy to be overt about it. Even 30 years ago, Out of Africa’s white-washed and romanticized vision of Kenyan colonialism struck more than a few people the wrong way; after all, while Kenya’s white-settler state collapsed 25 years before Sydney Pollack made his movie, in 1985, the apartheid state in South Africa had not yet been consigned to the dustbin of history.\nNelson Mandela was still in prison when a film romanticizing white settlers won seven Academy awards.\nEven in 1985, not everyone was oblivious to that irony. But, even today, Hollywood—and mainstream white entertainers like Swift—work hard to remain oblivious, to insist on the right to make iconography without being tarred with politics. For example, there was nothing surprising about MTV’s Video Music Awards featuring jokes about police violence, however shocking it may have been to see and hear. This is precisely why the Black Lives Matter movement exists: because most white people would prefer not to take black lives seriously. But you don’t make jokes about police violence at an awards show—as Rebel Wilson did—because you’re unaware of police violence against black people, or of the growing movement to top it. You make Black Lives Matter into a joke about “stripper police” because the reality makes you uncomfortable, and because you resent having to feel uncomfortable. You don’t want to listen to the haters; you don’t want to feel bad about white privilege. And so, as Taylor Swift taught us last year, you shake it off.\nAt a certain point in the 1950s, it become a bit more impolitic to make movies about how great and gallant slavery days had been. This is not to say that Hollywood suddenly began embracing progressive politics, but it was harder to enjoy the nostalgic glow of Dixie’s moonlight and magnolias at a time when redneck sheriffs were setting dogs on black children. This was the 1950s; today, people might prefer to remember the 1960s as the moment when America got hip, but Brown v. Board of Education was decided in 1954, followed by the Montgomery Bus Boycott the following year (though if these landmarks in Civil Rights History are usually regarded as the beginning of the movement, it was on April 23, 1951, that 16-year-old Barbara Johns led a student strike for equal education at Moton High School in Prince Edward County, Virginia).\nThe 1950s, in short, was when American white supremacy got a little less sexy. And so, after the Civil Rights Movement had made it harder for white people to openly long for the bygone days, Hollywood stopped making movies about how glamorous it was to be white in a white supremacist America—instead, they made movies about how sexy it was to be white in a white supremacist colonial state in Africa. The 1950s was a golden era for safari movies set in Africa, and the convergence between white romance and black bodies is both disturbing and predictable. Here, for example, are some films from the 1950s about white people being sexy together in Africa.\nKillers of Kilimanjaro, 1959. (Photo: Public Domain)\nSafari, 1956. (Photo: Public Domain)\nTarzan's Peril, 1951. (Photo: Public Domain)\nThese films were made—always about Kenya—at a time when Great Britain was fighting a long and ultimately Pyrric counter-insurgency campaign to put down what they called the “Mau Mau” uprising; the British liked this name because it fit the savage uprising they believed they were fighting (the “Mau Maus” themselves tended to use names like Kenya Land and Freedom Army). Britain would win the battle but lose the war; in 1963, Jomo Kenyatta would become the first president of independent Kenya, a black president who had, a few years earlier, been widely demonized as a Mau Mau general (he wasn’t, but that’s another story). This is why, for contemporary white supremacists, calling our black president a “Kenyan” is not just a way of marking him as foreign. It’s a way of marking him as a militant black power nationalist. In part, this is because black power movements in the 1960s and '70s looked to a (romanticized) vision of Mau Mau as a model. As Gerald Horne observes in Mau Mau in Harlem?:\n“Mau Mau” quickly became a metaphor for fierce resistance and was adopted as such by African Americans, before spreading as a verb to the population at large. In the heart of darkness that was Jim Crow Mississippi, Charles Evers—brother of the slain civil rights martyr, Medgar Evers—contemplated early on, \"Why not create a Mau Mau in Mississippi?” That is, “each time whites killed a Negro, why not drive to another town, find a bad sheriff or cop, and kill him in a secret hit-and-run raid.” So, they “bought bullets and made some idle Mau Mau plans\" before—presumably—dropping the idea.\nAmerican films about Africa were always also about America, which is why Hollywood collaborated in creating a romantic image of Mau Mau. The Mau Mau seen in films like Something of Value is a savage, atavistic cult, more indebted to decades of Tarzan movies (and contemporary British propaganda) than to anything in reality, but this is what it means to call Barack Obama a “Kenyan,” or to assert, hilariously, as this recent meme did, that “Denali is the Kenyan word for ‘Black Power.’”\nAmong Americans of a certain age, you could almost say that “Kenyan” is a word for black power.\nOf course, Taylor Swift was born in 1989, which means that for her entire adult life, a black man has been president of the United States. For an American of her age, “Barack Obama” is the American term for post-racialism—the conceit that bad things once happened and that we’re over it now.\nBut of course we aren’t. And after Swift was widely criticized for using a line of black women’s bodies as a prop in her video even she must have become aware that she couldn’t just shake it off and keep moving. And that’s why this video doesn’t look forward, why it wants to look back, to 1950, back to a time when the Civil Rights Movement hadn’t yet made white supremacy un-sexy. (As clever observers have noted, the two actors in the video are actually named for Swift’s grandparents; if she was born in 1989, she wants to track her biography back to 1950. But if her grandparents had gone on a romantic safari in 1950—as more than a few upper-class Americans did at the time—and Swift comes from a long line of bank presidents, hilariously—then Swift’s grandparents’ romance would have occurred against the backdrop of the innocent white supremacist playground which Kenya had been for its white tourists.)\nWhat's so romantic about white supremacy? Why do white people get off on this kind of fantasy? The harder people insist that such iconography is merely “classic,” the clearer it becomes that what makes it “classic”—and what makes such classic iconography desirable—is precisely the promise of guilt-free white supremacy. But nostalgia for colonial Africa is exactly like nostalgia for Dixieland segregation and Jim Crow. When white people get married at a Southern plantation house, it is Gone With the Wind and its inherited racial hierarchy that they are emulating, a sense of classic romance that was predicated on subjugated black bodies. The same is true of the African safari, a white landscape where white people can travel in luxury to look at animals, while the only black bodies are seen and not heard, serving, docile. Staging a music video against that backdrop is not that different than if Swift had cast herself as Scarlet O’Hara and Scott Eastwood as Rhett Butler, or used Nazi imagery in a video about ... something. But she would never do that. Those instances of white supremacy aren’t nearly so easy to enjoy; in the present moment, they hit too close to home.\nSo you go to Africa. Africa is timeless. Africa is classic. In Africa, you can turn back the clock. You can cast a few black people as porters, and leave them out of the shot. In Africa, you can make the collapse of colonial rule the backdrop for the collapse of a love affair. And then you collect your awards. And you donate to a conservation fund.

            "report_content": "For decades, the Alaska Federation of Natives has been pushing to restore the name of Mount McKinley, the tallest peak on the North American continent, to its original Koyukon Athabascan name, Denali. Earlier this week, following Obama’s endorsement of the change, U.S. Secretary of the Interior Sally Jewell announced that Denali would henceforth be the new, old name of this magnificent geological landmark.\nConservatives immediately protested with the usual talking points claiming abuse of presidential powers, even as the internet spit out a fantastically deluded meme claiming that “’Denali’ is the Kenyan word for ‘Black Power’.”\nThis claim is so obviously wrong that it could easily have been a parody put out by The Onion. Alas, so many people obeyed the command, “Like and Share to Spread Awareness,” that the meme’s been effectively outed as a demographic Rorschach test: if you believed the lie without laughing, you’re too old to be a Millennial. (I will confess that part of my poor, paranoid brain wondered if the meme was whipped up by Mark Zuckerburg’s minions as another secret experiment aimed at manipulating Facebook subscribers by messing with their page postings. Who knows, really?)\nSecret machinations and political theater aside, what does restoring the name “Denali” mean in the broader, cultural plane? Names are so critical to our understanding of the world that they drive our sense of identity. To name is to affirm the power of creation. As recorded in the Book of Genesis, it is by naming that God created Heaven and Earth, then Day and Night, thus simultaneously creating the primordial dualism that bedevils modern Western thought. It is by continuing to name things that we give order to “all the familiar landmarks of my thought – our thought,” wrote philosopher Michel Foucault in \"The Order of Things,\" “the thought that bears the stamp of our age and our geography – breaking up all the ordered surfaces and all the planes with which we are accustomed to take the wild profusion of existing things.”\nIn Denali’s case, the conceptual landmark is an imposing geographic landmark as well, one that has given rise to countless stories and shaped generation upon generation as it anchored Native peoples to the land. (You can listen to Athabascan storyteller Patricia Wade (from the Alaskan village of Chickaloon) tell stories of Denali here.)\nEarlier this year, the blog, “Athabascan Woman,” run by Angela Gonzalez, featured a round-up of Facebook comments regarding the “Denali” question. Vera Schafer affirmed: “That’s the real name. The people who came and changed every name didn’t know each place had a name.  The people who wrote about Alaska said it was ‘vast wastelands.’ It wasn’t because people were already living here and everything had a name. Every hill, knoll, river bends, slough had a native name.” Another commentator, Darlene Reena Herbert, wrote: “There is a word for everything on earth and beyond in Dinjii zhuh ginjik” (Native people language).”\nThat language, however, is not American English. Worse, the word itself, meaning “great one,” refers to the physical properties of the mountain, and not to the achievements of mortal men who become immortal through great deeds. “Alaska is full of glaciers and other places named for white male explorers,” Alaska transplant Amy Price McCord wrote in an email to me. These places include Prince William Sound and Mt. Edgecumbe (thought to be named after George, earl of Edgecumbe; its original Tlingit name is L’ux).\nThe names systematically affirm a colonialist mentality that subjugates rather than respects the land, exploiting a theologically-informed attitude to nature that has enriched coffers for centuries. Now, that model is beginning to crumble in the face of overwhelming evidence of climate change. The president’s trip to Alaska is partly driven by the widespread recognition that it’s one of the places in the world most vulnerable to its immediate effects.\nThe partisan refusal to recognize climate change is driving its own set of memes linking \"Denali\" to \"Denial.\" Hence there is political peril in restoring the names of people, places, and things using the names originally bestowed on them. Return the names to their original forms, return the land to the people? For some Conservatives, renaming is a sign that the world is run amok with political correctness, but also something more when the President of the U.S. endorses it. To restore a name symbolically acknowledges that other cultural systems have legitimacy and merit, which correspondingly confirms that the landmarks of my thoughts are not the same as the landmarks of your thoughts.\nHence the Conservative plaint that liberals are godless atheists, which is correct to the extent that “God” is understood as a holistic unifying principle permeating all aspects of socio-political life. Four centuries ago, this used to be the case when kings ruled by divine right and life was rotten for the 99 percent who weren't directly related to him. But it’s now the 21st century, and the U.S. elects its leaders. Welcome to post-modernity! For Alaskans, however, restoring the mountain’s name to “Denali” merely recognizes lived reality, insofar as people who actually reside in the state never called it “McKinley.” Locally, on the official as well as the vernacular plane, it’s always been Denali.\nJewell’s statement released earlier this week stressed that “the name Denali has been official for use by the State of Alaska since 1975, but even more importantly, the mountain has been known as Denali for generations.” In an email to me, augmented reality artist Nathan Shafer (whose collaboration with Angela Gonzalez on an Athabascan comic book can be seen here), confirmed her assessment. “Denali is what we have been calling it for years. Nobody in Alaska calls it Mt. McKinley.” He adds: “This is also [just] one mountain, which represents a change in how we respect First Nations people and their cultures. I would like to see where I live, in Cook Inlet, revert to what the Dena'ina Athabascans call it: Tikhatnu.”\nSarah Palin might have been able to see Russia from her house, but a good chunk of Alaskans can see Denali from their porch.  Jeanne Devon is editor-in-chief of the Alaskan political website The Mudflats. In an email to me, she writes: “To me personally, as one who sees the mountain every day the weather allows, I’ll be happy it is no longer named for a person, regardless of who that is.”\nThe land itself demands political recognition, but for First Peoples, who live with the land in a way that few in the lower 48th can fully comprehend, this means recognizing them too. Denali is not just a word, and restoring its name confirms its identity as part of a living culture. “It felt like Alaska Natives were given back something taken away from us,\" Gonzalez writes. \"People may think colonization is just something that you read about in text books. It is a very real thing when you see names like Mount McKinley take over our place names. People from all over the world travel to Alaska to see the nation’s highest peak. Now, they will see a place where the very President himself thought it was important enough to recognize and honor Athabascan people.”\nPaula Young Lee is the author of \"Deer Hunting in Paris,\" winner of the 2014 Lowell Thomas \"Best Book\" award of the Society of American Travel Writers.

Not only do weâthe American peopleâneed it, we deserve it.\nI am stating the obvious here, but itâs been a rough few years for blacks (and by years, I mean lots of yearsâcenturies full of years).

His current work is situated in three places: the Arctic in the U.S.–Canada borderlands; the desert in the U.S.–Mexico borderlands; and the mangrove forest of the Sundarban in the India–Bangladesh borderlands.\nAuthor of Seasons of Life and Land: Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and editor of Arctic Voices: Resistance at the Tipping Point, Subhankar was most recently co-editor (with T.J. Demos and Emily Eliza Scott) of the Routledge Companion to Contemporary Art, Visual Culture, and Climate Change; co-host (with U.S. Senator Tom Udall) of the UNM Biodiversity Webinar Series; and co-curator (with Josie Lopez) of Species in Peril Along the Rio Grande. Subhankar is the Lannan Foundation Endowed Chair and a professor of Art & Ecology at the University of New Mexico (UNM) where he serves as the founding director of both the UNM Center for Environmental Arts and Humanities and the Species in Peril project at UNM.\nEmphasis\nSubhankar will share stories and images during the evening talks. With interactive conversations with the guests, using concrete examples, he will discuss the significance of close reading of images and close reading of text—to make-visible otherwise overlooked themes. The conversations will be particularly attentive to how environmental and multispecies justice and Indigenous rights can guide and shape public policy for species conservation.\n \nIn the first talk, he will focus on the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, particularly its Coastal Plain, a biological nursery of global significance that the Indigenous Gwich’in people call, “the sacred place where life begins.” In the second talk, he will focus on some of the other important biological nurseries and culturally significant places in Arctic Alaska, including the Teshekpuk Lake wetlands, the Utukok River uplands, the Kasegaluk Lagoon, and the Arctic seas: the Beaufort and the Chukchi. In the third talk, he will share some of his most recent work from the desert of New Mexico and the tropical forests of India.\nCarolyn Finney, PhD is a storyteller, author and a cultural geographer. She is deeply interested in issues related to identity, difference, creativity, and resilience. Carolyn is grounded in both artistic and intellectual ways of knowing - she pursued an acting career for eleven years, but five years of backpacking trips through Africa and Asia, and living in Nepal changed the course of her life. Motivated by these experiences, Carolyn returned to school after a 15-year absence to complete a B.A., M.A. (gender and environmental issues in Kenya and Nepal) and a Ph.D. (where she was a Fulbright and a Canon National Science Scholar Fellow). Along with public speaking, writing, media engagements, consulting & teaching, she served on the U.S. National Parks Advisory Board for eight years.\nHer first book, Black Faces, White Spaces: Reimagining the Relationship of African Americans to the Great Outdoors was released in 2014. Recent publications include Self-Evident: Reflections on the Invisibility of Black Bodies in Environmental Histories (BESIDE Magazine, Montreal Spring 2020), and The Perils of Being Black in Public: We are all Christian Cooper and George Floyd (The Guardian, June 3rd 2020). She is currently working on a performance piece about John Muir (The N Word: Nature Revisited) as part of a Mellon residency at the New York Botanical Gardens Humanities Institute this summer and is the new columnist at the Earth Island Journal. She is also an artist-in-residence in the Franklin Environmental Center at Middlebury College.\nEmphasis\nWhat does it mean to be Black and be Green? While the murder of George Floyd struck at the heart of America’s unreconciled past concerning systemic racism, the experience had by Christian Cooper in Central Park ignited conversation within the environmental sector. In this moment of racial reckoning, Dr. Carolyn Finney weaves stories of our collective past with the personal (naming and claiming her family’s story of love, labor and erasure on the land) and invites us all to consider the power of accountability, reconciliation, and emergence as we dream up a new conversation.\nPrincess Daazhraii Johnson is Neets’aii Gwich’in and her family is from Arctic Village, Alaska. Johnson is the former Executive Director for the Gwich’in Steering Committee and is a founding member of the Fairbanks Climate Action Coalition. She also has experience working on climate adaptation for tribes through her on-going work with the Cold Climate Housing Research Center. Johnson received a B.A. in International Relations from The George Washington University and a Masters in Education at the University of Alaska Anchorage with a focus on Environmental and Science Education.\nShe has been a member of the SAG-AFTRA Native American Committee since 2007 and also serves on the Board of Dancing with the Spirit, a program that promotes spiritual wellness through music. In 2015 Johnson was appointed by President Obama to serve on the Board of Trustees for the Institute of American Indian Arts. She is based in Alaska and is currently creative producing an animated series for the WGBH that premiered on PBS in 2019.\nEmphasis\nIndigenous storytellers have a unique worldview based on Indigenous values that the world could benefit from as we navigate challenging times. In this talk, Johnson will discuss the history of both literature and cinema as they relate to Native American people, the damage this has caused, and how reclaiming our own image and stories is leading us through this time of transition in surprising and empowering ways.\nMargaret McKeown is a judge on the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, which covers nine states, including Alaska, and two US territories. She was appointed in 1998. Before joining the bench, Judge McKeown practiced law in Seattle and Washington, DC and was a Special Assistant to the Secretary of the Interior and at the White House. She is a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, a member of the Council of the American Law Institute, and former chair of the Federal Judges Association and the American Bar Association Rule of Law Initiative.

An avid hiker and outdoor woman, she was a member of the first American mountain climbing expedition to Mt. Shishapangma in Tibet.\nEmphasis:\nStay tuned! Additonal information forthcoming.\nTerry Tempest Williams\nTerry Tempest Williams has been called \"a citizen writer,\" a writer who speaks and speaks out eloquently on behalf of an ethical stance toward life. A naturalist and fierce advocate for freedom of speech, she has consistently shown us how environmental issues are social issues that ultimately become matters of justice. \"So here is my question,\" she asks, “what might a different kind of power look like, feel like, and can power be redistributed equitably even beyond our own species?\"\nKnown for her impassioned and lyrical prose, she is the author of the environmental literature classic, Refuge: An Unnatural History of Family and Place; An Unspoken Hunger: Stories from the Field; Desert Quartet; Leap; Red: Patience and Passion in the Desert; and The Open Space of Democracy. Her book Finding Beauty in a Broken World, was published in 2008 by Pantheon Books. She is a columnist for the magazine The Progressive. Her new book is The Story of My Heart by Richard Jeffries, as rediscovered by Brooke Williams and Terry Tempest Williams (Torrey House Press), in which she and Brooke Williams expand upon the 1883 book by Richard Jeffries. Her most recent book is The Hour of Land: A Personal Topography of America’s National Parks (Sarah Crichton Books/Farrar, Straus and Giroux). The book was published in June, 2016, to coincide with and honor the centennial of the National Park Service.\nBrooke Williams\nBrooke‘s life has been one of adventure and wilderness exploration.\nEarlier, this meant skiing and climbing in some of the great mountains of\nAmerica and wandering the cliffs and canyons of the Colorado Plateau.\nLately, during long solo walks he’s become familiar with his own vast and\ncomplex inner wilderness. His writing has documented his effort to\nunderstand the importance of wildness in modern life. Years ago, after\nencouragement from his mentor, the great teacher, William Kitteridge,\nBrooke realized that the one story he would tell over and over again for\nthe rest of his life would be this: “We live in bodies that are largely\nunchanged since the Pleistocene, trying to make them work in a world\nwhich is vastly different from the one for which evolution designed us.\nPerhaps acknowledging this is a big step toward solving some of our\ncurrent problems.”\nFrom this has come dozens of stories and articles, and\nfive books including Halflives: Reconciling Work and Wildness, and his\nmost recent, Open Midnight, which documents his exploration of places\nwhere the outer and inner wilderness meet. His conservation career spans\nfive decades, most recently with the Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance.\nHe has an MBA in Sustainable Business from the Bainbridge Graduate\nInstitute.\nEmphasis:\nBrooke and Terry will talk about connection and that wild places like Denali are not merely places to visit, but part of our DNA. They will explore that DNA using stories, ours as well as those of the participants, through writing and sharing.\nStan Senner recently retired as Vice President for Bird Conservation from the National Society. Stan brought to Audubon a unique combination of skill and experience with birds, science, conservation, and public policy. In a career spanning more than 45 years, he worked for The Wilderness Society and U.S. House of Representatives and helped pass the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act, served as executive director of Hawk Mountain Sanctuary in Pennsylvania, coordinated federal-state science and restoration programs following the Exxon Valdez oil spill in Alaska, and tracked the BP Deepwater Horizon oil disaster in the Gulf of Mexico for the Ocean Conservancy.\nStan worked for Audubon for more than 19 years, including 10 years as executive director of Audubon Alaska (1999-2009). Stan has received wide recognition for his work in conservation, including in a Lifetime Achievement Award in Shorebird Conservation from the international Western Hemisphere Shorebird Group in 2019. He was named a Fellow in the American Ornithological Society in 2020. Born and raised in Kansas, he holds an M.S. in biology from the University of Alaska-Fairbanks and lives with his wife, Pat, in Missoula, Montana.\nEmphasis:\nStay tuned! Additonal information forthcoming.\nSeptember 9-11\nRonn & Marketa are a husband and wife team, both in life and in business. They share a passion for many things, including photography, Northern Lights, nature, travel, and Angus, their wonderful Black Lab.\nRonn fell in love with photography in 2007 while working over the summer in California to pay his way through college. Later that year, he moved to Anchorage, Alaska, to follow his dream of becoming a professional photographer. It was then that he captured his first image of the Northern Lights and became entranced by their magic spell. In January 2008, he began working for a national school portrait studio and learned the ins and outs of studio portraiture. Later that summer, he moved to Fairbanks to manage their regional office. Being in the heart of Alaska put him in an excellent location for Aurora.\nMarketa was born and raised in the Czech Republic. In 2002, she moved to Iceland and went on to manage TGI Fridays for several years. During that time she fell in love with the night sky, the Aurora, the beautiful Icelandic landscapes and photography. She found that venturing out into the calm, cold, dark nights to photograph the Northern Lights was an excellent escape from the hustle and bustle of the busy restaurant. In 2011, she ventured to Alaska, where the two met and fell in love chasing the Aurora together. They were married a year later, beneath the majestic Aurora Borealis and have been “chasing the lights” together, ever since.\nEmphasis:\nRonn and Marketa will be discussing the science behind the Aurora Borealis-- why and how they occur, and when and where are the best time to see them. Additionally, they'll spend an evening discussing the best way to capture the northern lights in pictures and lead a nighttime excursion to look for and photograph the aurora.\n(907) 683-2290\nVisit our Anchorage Bed & Breakfast",
