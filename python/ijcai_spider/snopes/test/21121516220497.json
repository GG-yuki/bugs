            "report_content": "Municipalities commonly require, as a term and condition of employment, that municipal employees be residents of the City/Town for whom they are employed. This is a very emotional issue for both citizens and employees.  The citizens and elected officials often press for residency requirements on claims that it is a benefit to the community for employees to be residents.  The theory is that employees who are residents are more committed to the community.  They pay taxes in the community, own homes, use the schools and participate in the civic life. Some argue that it is a fair obligation to be required to be a resident in exchange for public employment. However, such requirements put a large burden on the public employees who lose choice in where they can live.  This impacts not only the employee him/herself but also the family of the employee.  If a family wants to live together a spouse/partner may be limited in where he/she can work, children are limited as to where to attend school and the employee may be unable to be a close part of his/her extended family, including caring for parents or other family members in need.\nGiven these important competing interests, there has been a great deal of litigation concerning residency obligations.  Nationwide litigation over residency requirements is fairly common. See e.g. Providence Teachers, Union Local 958, AFL-CIO, AFT v. City Council of City of Providence, 888 A.2d 9848 (R. I. 2005) (Rhode Island); Hill v. City of Scranton, 411 F.3d 118 (3rd Cir. 2005) (Pennsylvania); Gusewelle v. City of Wood River, 374 F. 3d 569 (7th Cir. 2004) (Illinois); Eastman v. City of Madison, 117 Wis.2d 106 (1983) (Wisconsin); City of Newark v. PBA Local 3, 272 N. J. Super. 31 (1994)( A.D., New Jersey); New Orleans Firefighters Ass’n Local 632, AFL-CIO v. City of New Orleans, 590 So.2D 1172 (La.1991) (Louisiana); Cleveland Branch, N.A.A.C.P. v City of Parma, 263 F.3d 513 (6th Cir.2001) (Ohio); Morgan v. City of Wheeling, 205 W. Va. 34 (1999) (West Virginia); Lewis v. City of Kinston, 127 N.C.App. 150 (1997) (North Carolina).\nThe U S Supreme Court has addressed the constitutional issues of a residency requirement and decided that residency requirements do not violate the Due Process Clause or the Equal Protection Clause since they are not “irrational.”  In McCarthy v. Philadelphia Civil Service Commission, 424  US  645 (1976), the Court specifically decided that a residency requirement for a public employee does not violate the constitutionally protected right of interstate travel.  The Court stated that there is no constitutional right to be employed by the City of Philadelphia while living elsewhere.Although residency requirements can be proper and enforceable, residency requirements are mandatory subjects of bargaining.  City of Worcester and Local 495 SEIU, AFL-CIO  MLC (1978).  Even in cases where there are city ordinances or charters the duty to bargain should exist.   Town of Lee and Lee Police Association, 10 MLC 1262 (1983).  Unions are therefore faced with various legal issues.  Some examples include:\n1.      Sudden enforcement of a “dormant” requirement2.      Procedures for measuring compliance with the requirements3.      Definition of residency4.      Exceptions to the requirements\n5.      Bargaining strategies\nOften, the labor relations issues arise when the municipal employer takes action to enforce actively an existing residency requirement.  Generally dormant residency requirements can be enforced despite a history of non enforcement or lax enforcement;   such lax enforcement does not establish a clear and unequivocal intention on the part of the Employer to forever relinquish its contractual rights with respect to residency.  However, individuals who moved believing that they were not required to be residents might be permitted to remain non residents on a reliance theory.  Lynn Police Association and City of Lynn  (L. Katz, Arbitrator).\nIssues also arise over the procedures used for enforcement.  Although it is generally accepted that an employer can take action to measure compliance with residency requirements there is much dispute over those mechanisms.  Bargaining is also implicated when the Employer changes the procedures or imposes additional obligations.  Employers may try to claim that inherent in having a residency requirement is the ability to measure compliance.  However enforcement criteria has been found to be bargainable.  In re Dracut School Committee 22 MLC 1013 (1995).\nEven in cases where compliance procedures are allowed, such procedures cannot require an employee to sign a form consenting to “voluntary termination” for falsification of the residency certification.  The employee continues to have contractual just cause protection as well as civil service protection where appropriate.  As Arbitrator Roberta Golick found in a case between the City of Boston and the Boston Police Patrolmen’s Association, requiring employees to “voluntarily” terminate their employment is “abhorrent to notions of fairness” and does “violence to the contractual just cause protection.”  Therefore enforcement mechanisms should be carefully considered and challenged where they overreach.\nThe definition of residency for purposes of municipal employee residency requirements is generally stated as “the actual principal residence of the individual, where he or she normally eats and sleeps and maintains normal personal and household effects.”  City of Lynn Charter 1999.  Even though such a definition may appear straight forward, the application of the residency standards is complicated.  For example, there are issues in cases of dual households, where an employer’s family lives outside the city but the employee sleeps at the city residence on workdays.  These situations are litigated through city compliance commissions, grievance arbitration or civil service proceedings if the employee is terminated for allegedly being in non compliance with the residency obligation.  Determinations are, of course, varied and very fact specific.\nAnother legal issue that arises is the concept of a “hardship exception” to a residency requirement.  Unions can and should take the position that there can be hardship exceptions to any residency requirement.  Most often there are employees who have been grandfathered as an exception since they were employed prior to the implementation of a residency requirement.  There should therefore be no legal prohibition against creating an exception for hardship as long as that exception has a reasonable basis and is based on principles of fairness.\nThere are also statutory reasons for a hardship exception.  In McDonald v. Menino, 1997 WL 106955 (D. Mass), two disabled employees were fired for violating the Boston residency ordinance.  The employees sued for discrimination under the ADA on grounds that the ordinance precluded reasonable accommodations.  The City moved to dismiss for failure to state a claim.  The court denied the motion finding that the City had provided no reason why the requested accommodation – an exception to the residency ordinance — harmed the City.  Therefore even where a residency requirement exists there can be and are exceptions.\nSome additional issues can be addressed in bargaining over residency requirements.  Unions can negotiate for replacing absolute residency requirements with a requirement that an employee be a resident for a certain number of years and then be permitted to move out of the city.  This creates a balance between the claimed benefits to the municipality and the ability of the employee to make choices over where to live.  Another method used in bargaining to address the economic burden of residing in an expensive city is for agreements to provide loans or other financing for the purchase of homes in the community.  The unions  can also establish municipal mortgage programs, such as the one established in Boston by the Boston Unions Residency Coalition.\nConsidering the clearly emotional and personal aspects to residency requirements it is clear that the challenges will continue.\nYour email address will not be published.

            "report_content": "It is not uncommon for states or municipalities to require local residency for public employment. Proponents of residency requirements feel that they benefit the community because residents are more likely to have a strong commitment to the community, to pay local taxes, attend local schools and participate in community activities. Critics of residency requirements often argue that removing the choice of where to live imposes too great a burden on the employee and his or her family. Residency requirements have been litigated in our courts all over the country. The United States Supreme Court has upheld the constitutionality of residency requirements in general, finding that they are not per se irrational.\nIn New Jersey, since September 1, 2011, the “New Jersey First Act”, signed into law by former Governor Chris Christie, has required most public employees working for the state, or one of its counties or municipalities, to live in New Jersey. That requirement has applied to employees of public agencies, commissions, public colleges and universities, and all school boards, among others to reside in the State of New Jersey unless otherwise exempted under the law. Exemptions were to be granted only when a worker could prove a “critical need or hardship.” Those who claimed qualification for the exemption had to present their case to New Jersey’s Employee Residency Review Committee and hope they were granted leave to live outside the state. As adopted by the Civil Service Commission, failure to comply with the State’s regulations on residence standards required the employee’s immediate suspension as “unfit for duty”.\nAn analysis by NJ Advance Media several years ago showed that in practice, the Employee Residency Review Committee has typically granted requests for exemptions to workers who can prove financial hardship or health concerns or who can submit proof that they are a “critical” employee who would be difficult to replace if they quit as a result of the residency requirement. Since its enactment, the Committee has granted exemptions to approximately 80% of applicants, with reasons ranging from child custody agreements to the inability to pay New Jersey’s high property taxes, to debilitating family illnesses. Other applicants have been granted permission to live outside the state simply by presenting a letter from their employer stating that they are “critical” to their work for the state.\nCritics of the New Jersey First Act blamed it for NJ Transit’s trouble finding enough engineers to keep trains operating. In September 2018, the Employee Residency Review Committee voted on a blanket exemption for all NJ Transit employees in “mission essential” jobs, including train engineers, bus drivers, conductors and rail maintenance workers. Additionally, many public and charter school employees have sought exemptions since the law was enacted, and schools have been especially critical of how the law has made recruitment and retention of high quality job candidates harder for them.\nThe Committee’s granting of exemptions for hardship have also not always been uniform or predictable. For instance, Rebecca Drake, a teacher in the Somerville school district, first applied to the state Employee Residency Review Committee in 2017 for an exemption to the residency law due to serious financial problems including a recent divorce, home foreclosure and looming bankruptcy. At the time, her application was rejected because she did not provide sufficient proof of her hardship. Drake moved out of state anyway, just a few miles over the New Jersey border in Pennsylvania. Rather than offering support, the Somerville Board of Education hired a private investigator to track the teacher to her Pennsylvania home where he observed her leaving the house one morning to take her children to school. Using that information, the Somerville Board of Education filed suit against Drake, seeking to terminate her despite her tenure and over a decade of service to the children in the Somerville school district. Drake applied for the exemption again in May 2018, and it was granted, allowing her to live out of state as long as she was teaching in Somerville schools. However, by then the school district’s lawsuit was already underway.\nIn good news for Rebecca Drake and many other public employees like her, the judge in the case ruled last week that New Jersey’s residency requirement is unconstitutional. Superior Court Judge Thomas Miller ruled that the state residency law is unconstitutional as applied to Drake and cannot be used to fire her. Specifically, the Court found that the New Jersey First Act is “vague” and does not adequately make clear what types of hardship exemptions should be granted and to whom. Important to note is that the Court’s decision applies only to Drake and does not automatically protect any other public employees living out of state. In order to invalidate the law for all state employees, the Legislature would have to repeal or rewrite it.\nThe constitutionality of public employment residency requirements is a complicated and fact specific issue that requires the attention of a skilled attorney.\nComments are closed.\nThis site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.\nPlease do not include any confidential or sensitive information in a contact form, text message, or voicemail.

First class cities, which operate under their own charters, are probably not restricted by RCW 35.21.200, discussed below, but are subject to the restrictions in the civil service statutes, also discussed below.\nSo, effectively only for mayor-council cities, RCW 35.21.200 provides, in part:\nAny city or town may by ordinance of its legislative authority determine whether there shall be any residential qualifications for any or all of its appointive officials or for preference in employment of its employees, but residence of an employee outside the limits of such city or town shall not be grounds for discharge of any regularly appointed civil service employee otherwise qualified.\nNote that this statute allows for “residential qualifications for “appointive officials” but only a residency “preference” for “employees.” While the statute provides no definitions of these terms to aid a city in making a distinction between “appointive officials” and “employees,” the former would include statutory officials such as the clerk and treasurer and department heads. (Of course, for many purposes, appointive officials are also considered to be employees.)\nThis statute also places limits on residency requirements, if they are adopted:\nEven though the above statute allows residency requirements, other state law prohibits cities from requiring residency for its civil service employees.  For city or town firefighters, RCW 41.08.075 prohibits any requirement that a civil service employee or officer\nreside within the limits of such municipal corporation as a condition of employment, or to discriminate in any manner against any such person because of his or her residence outside of the limits of such city, town, or municipality.\nThe same limitation applies to police officers covered by civil service. RCW 41.12.075. (Incidentally, the same prohibition also applies to fire districts. RCW 52.30.050.)\nHow about response time requirements? Even if a city or town is not permitted to adopt residency requirements for some or all of its employees, can’t it require that some of those employees, such a fire and police, be able to respond to emergencies within a specified period of time? Although we are not aware of any Washington legal authority on point, it is our opinion that a city may establish reasonable response time requirements for any staff members whose skills could be essential in responding to various types of emergencies, such as fires, crimes, utility infrastructure breaks, major disasters, or computer system crashes. Regarding the response time requirements adopted by cities of which we are aware, most fall within the 15-30 minute time range.\nMost cities probably do not have residency requirements for their employees, even if they can. Is it a good idea to require residency? Residency helps build a bond between employees and the community they serve. The public may expect city employees face the same restrictions, taxes, policies that they do, and that’s only possible if employees live within the same community where they work. On the other hand, requiring residency limits the size of the pool from which good employees come – probably the strongest argument against requiring residency. The smaller the city, of course, the more that becomes an issue. Ultimately, it is a policy decision, one that needs to be carefully considered.\nFinally, note that, if the affected employees of a proposed residency or response time requirement are members of a union, this would be a matter that would need to be bargained.\nMRSC is a private nonprofit organization serving local governments in Washington State.

            "report_content": "Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker are locked in a heated debate over whether cities and school districts should be able to require employees to live in the jurisdictions where they work.\nWalker, a Republican, tucked a provision into his budget proposal that would prevent Wisconsin cities and school districts from imposing residency requirements on their employees. He argues it is an issue of personal freedom and individual choice, and that the residency requirement for Milwaukee teachers dissuades talented applicants from applying.\nBarrett, a Democrat, said the state should stay out of Milwaukee's affairs, and has called Walker's proposal “the very definition of big brother government.” He has publicly fretted about a potential exodus from Milwaukee of middle-class public employees –and a corresponding loss in tax revenue.\nHe used the Michigan legislature's 1999 elimination of residency requirements as a cautionary tale in an interview with the local Business Journal. “Eleven years ago the city of Detroit lifted the residency requirement for police officers and today, 53 percent of officers live outside of the city,” he said. “If we want the tax base of Milwaukee to resemble the tax base of Detroit, this is the way to go.”\nScott fired back in an interview with the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. “It's a weak argument, or an argument of weakness,” he said. “It's saying the only way we can keep people here is to build a wall.”\nResidency requirements in big cities are not as common as they used to be. “It can be pitched as a free choice issue, but on the other hand the whole purpose of residency requirements is to give public employees a real stake in the cities they serve, and of course to capture the revenues that they've generated,” said Peter Eisinger, a professor for The New School for Management and Urban Policy in New York who has studied residency requirements.\nPhiladelphia police several years ago negotiated a contract provision that allows them to live outside the city after five years on the job. Minnesota repealed the Minneapolis residency requirement in 1999, and Missouri lifted residency requirements for St. Louis police in 2005 and for firefighters in 2010.\nThe Ohio legislature passed a measure banning municipal residency requirements in 2006, which the state Supreme Court upheld in 2009. Cleveland's City Council fought back earlier this month with a city ordinance that requires all employees to live in Ohio and all emergency personnel to live within Cuyahoga County or six adjacent counties.\n“It's primarily to be prepared,” said Maureen Harper, communications chief for Cleveland Mayor Frank Jackson. “Fortunately in the last several years, the city hasn't faced a major crisis. In the event that we do, we need to make sure that first responders can get on the job quickly.” The ordinance comes on the heels of a series of audits that revealed leave abuses and shift-trading among firefighters, allowing some to live as far away as California for months at a time.\nMilwaukee's public safety unions have been pushing for an end to residency requirements for years. David Seager, president of the Milwaukee Professional Firefighters Association, said the requirement is archaic and dates back to an age when transportation options were more limited. He doesn't expect many Milwaukee firefighters to leave the city, where about 75 percent of them own homes, but believes they should have the choice to do so.\nSeager also dismisses the idea that public safety personnel should live within city limits so they can respond quickly to an emergency, pointing out that a full staff of 232 firefighters is on duty at all times. “There is not a massive disaster that our on-duty staff cannot mitigate,” he said. “I find it very insulting when people insinuate that we would not be part of the community if we do decide to leave the city.”\nMany Detroiters blame the end of the residency requirement for accelerating the city's decline. Ken Cole, Detroit's lobbyist in Lansing, pointed out that candidates for public jobs know when they apply that they will have to live in the community where they'll work. “It is the height of hypocrisy that many of the employees fast forward and now say ‘I have no choice where I live,'” Cole said.\nA year after the state repealed Detroit's residency requirement, the Anderson Economic Group, a consulting firm, estimated the change would reduce the city's annual revenue by $21 million. But Cole said the actual impact has likely been far greater than anticipated.\nFor example, many of the public employees who have moved out of the city are police officers and firefighters, and their departure has decimated some formerly middle-class neighborhoods, Cole said. “To the degree that that has compromised public safety, it has a snowballing effect that has precipitated the departure of other city residents,” he said. “You feel safer with cops and firefighters in your neighborhood.”\nDaily update — original reporting on state policy, plus the day's five top reads from around the web.\nWe are driven by the power of knowledge to solve today's most challenging problems.

Mayor Jim Kenney allowed the ordinance to go into effect without his signature.\nThis rule for civil service, which covers 81% of the roughly 30,000 positions in Philadelphia city government, was proposed after the protests over the death of George Floyd, who died during an arrest in Minneapolis. Some residency requirement backers expressed hope that it would produce a more diverse group of incoming police officers, in particular. The Philadelphia Police Department is 55% non-Hispanic White, 33% Black, and 9% Hispanic, while the city’s population is 34% non-Hispanic White, 40% Black, and 15% Hispanic.\nResidency requirements for municipal jobs are not uncommon in large American cities, although many, particularly in the South and West, do not have them. Some mandate that jobholders establish residency on their start dates or within weeks or months of their appointment. That had been the case in Philadelphia since 2008, with the time period set at six months in most cases. Those applying for laborer positions had to have been residents for at least one year before starting. And individuals must continue to live in the city to keep their jobs, although police officers and firefighters are permitted to move out after five years.\nTable 1 shows the residency policies in each of the 30 most populous U.S. cities, listed from largest to smallest. In 12 of them, state law prevents residency requirements; that’s the case in California, Michigan, Ohio, and Texas. Denver, which previously had a residency requirement, eliminated it to enhance competitive recruitment. Other cities, including Baltimore and Washington, restrict their residency requirements to certain job classes or salary bands. Most residency requirements take effect after a new employee starts working.\nBesides Philadelphia, Boston is the only one of the 30 cities to require any employees to live in the city for a year prior to appointment—but that applies only to police officers. This rule was adopted in March 2016 after the mayor and City Council formed a special commission in response to a 2014 newspaper investigation, which found that police command staff and other city department leaders were living outside Boston despite a residency requirement. At the time, only some municipal employees were required to live within city limits.\nBoston’s 2016 ordinance requires police officers to be city residents for at least a year prior to appointment. Nearly all other city employees must be residents by their appointment date.\nTable 1\nSource: Civil service rules and regulations for each city\n© 2020 The Pew Charitable Trusts\nPhiladelphia is not the only city to consider changing its residency requirement in response to the deaths of Floyd and others killed by police. In Detroit, Council President Brenda Jones wanted to do it for police officers: “If the young people see officers living in their community, it gives them an opportunity to say, ‘I want to be like Chief [Robert] Dunlap.’ … With no law enforcement living in their community, … they don’t have that mentorship.” But Detroit cannot impose such a requirement without the state Legislature’s permission.\nIn Baltimore, changes to residency requirements must be enacted by the Maryland General Assembly. A new state law taking effect in January 2022 will require all Baltimore police command staff members at the rank of colonel or deputy commissioner to live in the city after their start date.\nPhiladelphia’s rule change, proposed by Councilmember Cherelle Parker on Council President Darrell Clarke’s behalf, was adopted by a 16-1 vote. In a statement on the bill, Clarke, Parker, and fellow Councilmembers Curtis Jones Jr. and Mark Squilla said they had the police department in mind. They noted that the move “will not be a ‘silver bullet’ in curing [the department’s] long-entrenched systemic issues, but it’s a step in the right direction. … If they must look to hire from within the city’s borders and commit to their diversity goal, they have a chance at improving the culture within the force.” Waivers are an option if the city can’t find qualified Philadelphians for specific jobs. But Parker said if that happens in a city with nearly 1.6 million residents, “Shame on us.”\nPew explored the city’s employment practices in the 2018 report “Hiring and Employment in Philadelphia City Government.” At the time, Philadelphia had some of the strictest civil service hiring rules of any large U.S. city, including the Rule of Two, which requires hiring managers to choose between the top two scorers on a civil service exam.\nUntil the first decade of this century, Philadelphia and other U.S. cities had a one-year residency requirement for job candidates. But many abandoned this approach—as Philadelphia did in 2008—to create a larger applicant pool and more competitive hiring. By reverting to the old rule, Philadelphia now becomes an outlier.\nLarry Eichel is a senior adviser and Katie Martin is a senior manager with The Pew Charitable Trusts’ Philadelphia research and policy initiative.\nResources for federal, state, and local decision-makers\nData-driven policymaking is not just a tool for finding new solutions for emerging challenges, it makes government more effective and better able to serve the public interest.\nIn hiring municipal employees, Philadelphia, like many U.S. cities, faces the challenge of attracting top talent and diversifying its workforce while adhering to long-standing regulations that often restrict the pool of candidates. To residents, municipal workers embody city government; and to a large degree, their performance determines the quality and perception of city services.\nReceive our latest research on Philadelphia—plus related news and facts (monthly).\nWe are driven by the power of knowledge to solve today's most challenging problems.

            "report_content": "Home » Legal News » Residency Requirements for Municipal Employees\nBy:  Robert B. McCoy\nrobert.mccoy@mhtlaw.com\nIn most cases, a municipality can chose whether to mandate that its employees reside within the municipality’s corporate limits.   Special rules, however, apply to police officers, firefighters and appointed officers of a municipality.\nMunicipalities that have chosen to impose employee residency requirements have sometimes faced constitutional challenges to their policies.  These challenges seldom succeed in the courts.  All that is needed for an employee residency requirement to be constitutional is that the municipality had a “rational basis” for adopting the requirement.  This standard can be easily met.  The Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals (the federal appeals court that sits in Chicago) has noted, for example, that a city’s need to have its employees sometimes available on short notice is a sufficient, rational reason for a residency requirement to make it constitutional.  Gusewelle v. City of Wood River, 374 F.3d 569, 578 (7th Cir. 2004.)\nAlthough municipalities may choose to impose residency requirements on employees, the Municipal Code provides that certain appointed municipal officers must be residents. The default rule is that all appointed officers must be residents of the municipality in which they serve. (65 ILCS 5/3.1-10-6.) However, the Municipal Code exempts from this residency requirement “municipal engineers, health officers, attorneys, or other officers who require technical training or knowledge.”  There are no reported court cases giving guidance on this point, but it appears that a city council or village board could not adopt an ordinance imposing a residency requirement on “municipal engineers, health officers, attorneys, or other officers who require technical training or knowledge,” where such an ordinance would probably constitute an unlawful restriction on the mayor’s or village president’s authority to appoint officers of his or her choosing to these offices.\nPolice officers and firemen are considered officers, and per default rule, they must be residents of their municipality.  But, unlike the case for other officers, the Municipal Code expressly provides that a municipality can adopt an ordinance that changes this default rule and not require that its police officers and firemen be residents.  It is our opinion that a municipality could also exclude its police chief or fire chief from any residency requirements.  Note that for municipalities whose police officers of firemen are appointed by a board of police and fire commissioners, residency requirements for police officers or firemen cannot be made more restrictive for any individual during his or her period of service, nor can residency be made a condition of promotion, except for the rank or position of fire or police chief.  (65 ILCS 5/10-2.1-6.)\nWho is an officer of a municipality, as opposed to a mere employee, is not always clear.  The Municipal Code lists the following positons, which may be filled by the mayor or village president with the advice and consent of the city council or village board, as being appointive offices:  “(1) a treasurer (if the treasurer is not an elected position in the municipality), (2) a collector, (3) a comptroller, (4) a marshal, (5) an attorney or a corporation counsel, (6) one or more purchasing agents and deputies, (7) the number of auxiliary police officers determined necessary by the corporate authorities, (8) police matrons, (9) a commissioner of public works, (10) a budget director or a budget officer, and (11) other officers necessary to carry into effect the powers conferred upon municipalities.”  (65 ILCS 5/3.1-30-5.)  This last category is vague, but the courts have provided some guidance in its interpretation.  In determining whether a person is an employee or an officer, the courts look at whether appointment is for a certain term, whether an oath of office is required, and whether the person has the supervisory and discretion to act on behalf of the municipality.   Rinchich v. Village of Bridgeview, 235 Ill. App. 3d 614, 628, 601 N.E.2d 1202, 1211 (1st Dist. 1992).\nIf a position is held by an appointed officer, as opposed to a hired employee, and if there is no statutory exception that allows or requires the officer to be a non-resident, the Municipal Code requires that the person to be a resident.  For example, an appointed city administrator, who exercises a large amount of discretion in the performance of his or her duties, would likely be an officer, and without an applicable exception to the default rule that appointed officers must be residents, the city administrator would be required to be a city resident.\nIn summary:",
