In the fall of 1835 many Texans, both Anglo-American colonists and Tejanos, concluded that liberalism and republicanism in Mexico, as reflected in its Constitution of 1824, were dead. The dictatorship of President Antonio López de Santa Anna, supported by rich landowners, had seized control of the governments and subverted the constitution. As dissension and discord mounted in Texas, both on the military front and at the seat of the provisional government of the Consultation at San Felipe, the colonists agreed that another popular assembly was needed to chart a course of action. On December 10, 1835, the General Council of the provisional government issued a call for an election on February 1, 1836, to choose forty-four delegates to assemble on March 1 at Washington-on-the-Brazos. These delegates represented the seventeen Texas municipalities and the small settlement at Pecan Point on the Red River. The idea of independence from Mexico was growing. The Consultation sent Branch T. Archer, William H. Wharton, and Stephen F. Austin to the United States to solicit men, money, supplies, and sympathy for the Texas cause. At New Orleans, in early January of 1836, the agents found enthusiastic support, but advised that aid would not be forthcoming so long as Texans squabbled over whether to sustain the Mexican constitution. They then proceeded to Washington and separated: Wharton remained in the capital, Archer went to Richmond, and Austin headed for New York City.\nThe convention held at Washington-on-the-Brazos on March 1, 1836, was quite different from the Consultation. Forty-one delegates were present at the opening session, and fifty-nine individuals attended the convention at some time. Two delegates (José Francisco Ruiz and José Antonio Navarro of Bexar) were native Texans, and one (Lorenzo de Zavala) had been born in Mexico. Only ten of the delegates had been in Texas by 1836. A majority were from other places-primarily from the United States, but also from Europe. Two-thirds of the delegates were not yet forty years old. Several had broad political experience. Samuel P. Carson of Pecan Point and Robert Potter of Nacogdoches had served, respectively, in the North Carolina legislature and in the United States House of Representatives. Richard Ellis, representing the Red River district and president of the convention, and Martin Parmer of San Augustine, had participated in constitutional conventions in Alabama (1819) and Missouri (1821), respectively. Sam Houston, a former United States congressman and governor of Tennessee, was a close friend of United States president Andrew Jackson. Houston was chosen commander in chief of the revolutionary army and left the convention early to take charge of the forces gathering at Gonzales. He had control of all troops in the field-militia, volunteers, and regular army enlistees. The convention delegates knew they must declare independence-or submit to Mexican authority. If they chose independence they had to draft a constitution for a new nation, establish a strong provisional government, and prepare to combat the Mexican armies invading Texas.\nOn March 1 George C. Childress, who had recently visited President Jackson in Tennessee, presented a resolution calling for independence. At its adoption, the chairman of the convention appointed Childress to head a committee of five to draft a declaration of independence. When the committee met that evening, Childress drew from his pocket a statement he had brought from Tennessee that followed the outline and main features of the United States Declaration of Independence. The next day, March 2, the delegates unanimously adopted Childress's suggestion for independence. Ultimately fifty-eight members signed the document. Thus was born the Republic of Texas.\nThe convention declared all able-bodied men ages seventeen to fifty liable for military duty and offered land bounties of 320 to 1,280 acres for service from three months to one year. Those men who left Texas to avoid military service, refused to participate, or gave aid to the enemy would forfeit their rights of citizenship and the lands they held in the republic. The convention also halted public land sales and closed the land offices. It authorized its agents in the United States to seek a $1 million loan and pledge land for its redemption. With the declaration of independence, the chairman appointed one person from each municipality to a committee to draft a constitution. If one individual can be designated the \"father of the Texas Constitution,\" it should be David Thomas, who chaired the committee, spoke for the group, and put the draft together. The convention adopted the document about midnight on March 16.\nThe Constitution of the Republic of Texas was patterned after that of the United States and several Southern states. It provided for a unitary, tripartite government consisting of a legislature, an executive, and a judiciary. The arrangement was more like that of a state than a federal system of states bound together by a central government. The document specified that the president would serve three years and could not succeed himself in office. He would be the commander in chief of the army, navy, and militia, but could not \"command in person\" without the permission of Congress. There would be a two-house Congress. The House of Representatives would comprise from 24 to 40 members until the population reached 100,000; thereafter the number of seats would increase from 40 to 100. Members would serve one-year terms. The number of seats in the Senate would be \"not less than one-third nor more than one-half that of the House.\" Senators were to serve three-year overlapping terms, with one-third elected each year. The constitution legalized slavery but prohibited the foreign slave trade. Immigrants from the United States could bring slaves with them. Free Blacks could not live in Texas without the consent of Congress. No minister of the Gospel could hold public office. The constitution also contained a bill of rights. An ad interim government would direct affairs until general elections were possible.\nWith news that the Alamo had fallen and Mexican armies were marching eastward, the convention hastily adopted the constitution, signed it, and elected an ad interim government: David G. Burnet, president; Lorenzo de Zavala, vice president; Samuel P. Carson, secretary of state; Thomas J. Rusk, secretary of war; Bailey Hardeman, secretary of the treasury; Robert Potter, secretary of the navy; and David Thomas, attorney general. The delegates then quickly abandoned Washington-on-the-Brazos. The government officers, learning that Houston's army had crossed the Colorado River near the site of present La Grange (Fayette County) on March 17 and was retreating eastward, fled to Harrisburg and then to Galveston Island. With news of the Texan victory at San Jacinto, the Burnet government hastened to the battlefield and began negotiations to end the war. On May 14 at Velasco, Texas officials had Santa Anna sign two treaties, one public and one secret. The public treaty ended hostilities and restored private property. Texan and Mexican prisoners were to be released, and Mexican troops would retire beyond the Rio Grande. By the terms of the secret treaty, Texas was to take Santa Anna to Veracruz and release him. In return, he agreed to seek Mexican government approval of the two treaties and to negotiate a permanent treaty that acknowledged Texas independence and recognized its boundary as the Rio Grande. Military activity continued briefly along the Gulf Coast. On June 2 Maj. Isaac W. Burton, leading twenty mounted rangers, contacted a suspicious vessel in Copano Bay and signaled the vessel to send its boat ashore. His men captured the vessel, named the Watchman, and found it loaded with supplies for the Mexican army. On the seventeenth Burton seized the Comanche and the Fannie Butler, which were carrying provisions for the enemy valued at $25,000. Word soon reached Texas that the Mexican Congress had repudiated Santa Anna, rejected his treaties, and ordered the war with Texas to continue.\nThere was a widespread clamor that Santa Anna should be put to death, and on June 4-after the dictator, his secretary Ramón Martínez Caro, and Col. Juan N. Almonte had been put aboard the Invincible to be returned to Veracruz-Gen. Thomas Jefferson Green, who had just arrived from the United States with volunteers, compelled President Burnet to remove the Mexicans from the vessel and confine them. On June 25 Burnet appointed as secretary of war Mirabeau B. Lamar, a major general, to succeed Rusk, who had asked to be relieved. But with word that Gen. José de Urrea was advancing on Goliad, Rusk changed his mind about retiring. Thomas Jefferson Green and Felix Huston, who had brought volunteers from Mississippi, stirred up the soldiers against Lamar, and Rusk resumed command. When Urrea failed to appear, Rusk vacated his command and the army chose Huston to replace him. Army unrest continued as the officers openly defied the government and threatened to impose a military dictatorship.\nThere were also other problems. On the morning of May 19, Comanche and Caddo Indians attacked Fort Parker, on the Navasota River some sixty miles above the settlements, and carried into captivity two women and three children. The government lacked the men and resources to retaliate. Communications were poor, roads were few, and there was no regular mail system. The treasury was empty, the new nation's credit was in low repute, money was scarce. There was much confusion over land titles. Many families were nearly destitute. They had lost heavily in the Runaway Scrape after the fall of the Alamo, and upon returning home found their property ravaged and their stock consumed or scattered. By July Burnet and his cabinet began shifting responsibilities. The ad interim president called an election for the first Monday in September to set up a government under the constitution. The voters were asked to (1) approve the constitution, (2) authorize Congress to amend the constitution, (3) elect a president, other officers, and members of Congress, and (4) express their views on annexation to the United States.\nThe choice of a president caused concern. Henry Smith, governor of the provisional government, quickly announced his candidacy for the office. Stephen F. Austin also entered the race, but he had accumulated enemies because of the land speculations of his business associate Samuel May Williams. Many newcomers to Texas knew little of Austin, and some thought he had been too slow in supporting the idea of independence. Rusk refused to run. Finally, just eleven days before the election, Sam Houston became an active candidate. On election day, September 5, Houston received 5,119 votes, Smith 743, and Austin 587. Lamar, the \"keenest blade\" at San Jacinto, was elected vice president. Houston received strong support from the army and from those who believed that his election would ensure internal stability and hasten recognition by world powers and early annexation to the United States. He was also expected to stand firm against Mexico and seek recognition of Texas independence. The people voted overwhelmingly to accept the constitution and to seek annexation, but they denied Congress the power of amendment.\nThe First Texas Congress assembled at Columbia on October 3, 1836. It consisted of fourteen senators and twenty-nine representatives. The next day ad interim President Burnet delivered a valedictory address. He urged Congress to authorize land grants to the veterans of the revolution and reminded his listeners that the national debt stood at $1,250,000. On October 22 Houston took the oath of office as president before a joint session of Congress. In his inaugural, he stressed the need for peace treaties with the Indians and for constant vigilance regarding \"our national enemies-the Mexicans.\" He hoped to see Texas annexed to the United States. Houston requested the Senate to confirm his cabinet appointments. He named Stephen F. Austin to be secretary of state; Henry Smith, secretary of the treasury; Thomas J. Rusk and Samuel Rhoads Fisher secretary of war and secretary of the navy, respectively; and James Pinckney Henderson, attorney general. When Congress later established the office of postmaster general, Houston named Robert Barr of Nacogdoches to that post, and at Barr's death chose John Rice Jones, who had held the office under the provisional government, as his successor. Jones patterned the Texas postal system, which was placed in 1841 under the State Department, after that of the United States. All persons transporting mail for the Post Office Department during 1837 could take payment in land at fifty cents an acre and pay expenses. Postal rates were 6¼ cents for the first twenty miles, and rose to 12½ cents for up to fifty miles. The rates applied to one-page letters folded over and addressed on the front. Envelopes came into use around 1845.\nCongress adopted a flag and a seal for the new republic. The first national flag had \"an azure ground, with a large golden star central.\" In January of 1839, the flag was redesigned to have a blue perpendicular stripe one-third the its length, a white star with five points in the center of the blue field, and two horizontal stripes of equal width, the upper being white and the lower red. This \"Lone Star Flag\" remained the state flag after annexation. Provisional governor Smith had used a large overcoat button with a star for a seal. This design led Congress on December 10 to decree that the seal would be circular with a single star and the words \"Republic of Texas\" encircling it. In 1839 Congress decreed that the seal should include \"a white star of five points, on an azure ground, encircled by an olive and live oak branches, and the letters Republic of Texas.\"\nThe court system inaugurated by Congress included a Supreme Court consisting of a chief justice appointed by the president and four associate justices, elected by a joint ballot of both houses of Congress for four-year terms and eligible for reelection. The associates also presided over four judicial districts. Houston nominated James Collinsworth to be the first chief justice. The county-court system consisted of a chief justice and two associates, chosen by a majority of the justices of the peace in the county. Each county was also to have a sheriff, a coroner, justices of the peace, and constables to serve two-year terms. Congress formed twenty-three counties, whose boundaries generally coincided with the existing municipalities.\nThe choice of a national capital proved difficult, and each house appointed a committee to make recommendations. The Senate selected Nacogdoches, while the lower house favored a site at San Jacinto. On November 14, the two houses agreed on a temporary location. Augustus Chapman Allen and John Kirby Allen, two brothers who were promoting a new town named Houston on Buffalo Bayou, offered to provide buildings for the government and lodgings for congressmen. Congress chose Houston to be the temporary capital, and the government moved there in April 1837.\nOn December 19, 1836, the Texas Congress unilaterally set the boundaries of the republic. It declared the Rio Grande to be the southern boundary, even though Mexico had refused to recognize Texas independence. The eastern border with Louisiana presented problems. Houston took up the matter with the United States through diplomatic channels, and a treaty was signed in Washington on April 25, 1838, which provided that each government would appoint a commissioner and a surveyor to run the boundary. Texas chose Memucan Hunt and John Overton to join their United States counterparts at the mouth of the Sabine River. The work stalled when the commissioners could not agree on whether Sabine Lake was the \"Sabine river\" named in the treaty. On November 24, 1849, after annexation, the United States Congress recognized the Texas claim that the boundary ran through the middle of the lake.\nNational defense and frontier protection also claimed Houston's attention. Threats of a Mexican invasion and the fear of Indian raids kept the western counties in turmoil. Congress passed several acts dealing with frontier defense. In December 1836 it authorized a military force of 3,587 men and a battalion of 280 mounted riflemen, and appropriated funds to build forts and trading posts to encourage and supervise Indian trade. In case of a Mexican invasion, Congress empowered Houston to accept 40,000 volunteers from the United States. President Houston took a practical view of the situation. He downplayed Mexican threats, labeling them braggadocio and bombast. If the enemy invaded, he reasoned, Texans would rush to defend their homes. Ranger units on the frontier could handle the Indian situation. Houston's primary concern was to negotiate treaties with the Indians ensuring fair treatment. As for the army, Houston feared that Felix Huston, the commander and a military adventurer, might commit a rash act. He sent Albert Sidney Johnston to replace him. When Johnston reached Camp Independence, near Texana, on February 4, 1837, Huston challenged him to a duel and severely wounded him. Huston retained command, but later relinquished his position to Johnston. In May General Johnston left for New Orleans to seek medical attention and turned over his command to a Colonel Rodgers. The temporary commander urged the soldiers to march on the capital at Houston, \"chastise the President\" for his weak defense policies, \"kick Congress out of doors, and give laws to Texas.\" At the same time Huston came to Houston and raised a clamor for a campaign against Mexico. When the general visited the president, Houston treated him cordially, but promptly ordered acting secretary of war William S. Fisher to furlough three of the four army regiments. The remaining troops were gradually disbanded. Houston planned to depend on the militia, ranger companies, and troops called for special duty.\nHouston hoped, by keeping military units out of the Indian country and seeking treaties with various tribes, to avoid difficulties with the Indians. He sent friendly \"talks\" to the Shawnees, Cherokees, Alabama-Coushattas, Lipans, Tehuacanas, Tonkawas, Comanches, Kichais, and other groups. The most pressing problem involved the Cherokees, who had settled on rich lands along the Sabine and elsewhere in East Texas. Neither Spain nor Mexico had given them title to their lands. At the time of the Texas Revolution, the Consultation, hoping to keep the Cherokees and their associated bands quiet, sent Sam Houston to make a treaty guaranteeing them title to their land, and they had remained quiet during the difficult days. When Houston became president, he submitted the Cherokee treaty to the Senate for ratification, but that body killed it in December 1837. In October 1838 Houston authorized agents to run a line between the settlements and the properties of the Cherokees and associate bands, per the treaty of 1836, but he had to halt the project when difficulties developed.\nLand disposal presented another problem that Houston grappled. In 1836 the Republic of Texas had a public domain of 251,579,800 acres (minus 26,280,000 acres granted before the revolution). This land eventually freed Texas from debt, pay for military services and public buildings, and provided endowments for many of her institutions. The Texas Congress had voted liberal land laws in 1836. Under the constitution, the heads of families (Blacks and American Indians excepted) living in Texas on March 2, 1836, could apply for a square league (4,428 acres) and a labor (177.1 acres) of land. Single men over age seventeen could receive one-third of a league. No one was required to live on the land. To encourage settlement, Congress also offered immigrants arriving between March 2, 1836, and October 1, 1837, a grant of 1,280 acres for heads of families and 640 acres for single men. Congress later allowed 640 acres and 320 acres, respectively, to heads of family and single men arriving after October 1, 1837, and before January 1, 1842. However, all immigrants arriving after March 2, 1836, had to live in Texas three years to receive clear title. Texas Revolution veterans arriving before August 1, 1836, received the same grants as original colonists and if permanently disabled could claim an additional 640 acres (known as donation grants). Veterans of the battle of San Jacinto (including those wounded on April 20 before the battle and members of the baggage and camp guard), participants in the siege of Bexar, and the heirs and survivors of those who died at the Alamo or had served in the Matamoros and Goliad campaigns could receive additional land. Grants were given for postrevolution military service varying from 320 acres for three months' duty to 1,240 acres for twelve months'.\nLand sales, however, ran into problems. Texas offered land scrip or land at fifty cents an acre, when public land in the United States was $1.25 an acre, but the republic actually made few sales. Scrip sales ran into the problems of depreciated currency and forged certificates. Despite the cheap selling price, land acquisition could be costly, since applicants had to pay for locating, surveying, and obtaining title, services that amounted to about one-third the value of the land. Because old settlers and veterans were not required to live upon the land to obtain title, they frequently sold their certificates to others who located land outside the settlements. This land often sat ten or more years before it became part of a county. To encourage home ownership Congress enacted a homestead law on January 26, 1839. The act, patterned somewhat after legislation of Coahuila and Texas, guaranteed every citizen or head of family in the republic \"fifty acres of land or one town lot, including his or her homestead, and improvements not exceeding five hundred dollars in value.\" Earlier, in December 1836, Congress had voted to reopen the land offices closed by the Permanent Council and the Consultation. Houston vetoed the bill, saying that existing land claims should be validated before new surveys were made. Congress passed the law over his veto, but in December 1837, before it went into effect, the succeeding Congress enacted a more comprehensive land act. It called for opening a land office for the use of old settlers and soldiers in February 1838, and for all others six months later. Houston vetoed the bill, but saw it passed over his veto. As Congress refused to modify the land laws, Houston kept the General Land Office closed throughout his administration.\nMeeting in special session in May 1837 in Houston, the First Congress instituted a commission-at-large to locate a permanent capital. The commission recommended Bastrop (first choice), Washington-on-the Brazos, San Felipe, and Gonzales. As no action was taken, in December Congress selected a site commission from its members, and in April 1838, the group picked a vacant tract on the Colorado near La Grange. In January 1839 under the Lamar administration, Congress authorized still a third commission, drawn from its membership. It stipulated that the site be between the Trinity and Colorado rivers and north of the Old San Antonio Road and recommended that the capital be named Austin. The commissioners selected the frontier settlement of Waterloo, on the east bank of the Colorado some thirty-five miles above Bastrop, and purchased 7,135 acres of land there for $21,000. The site was surveyed into city lots, and construction began on government buildings, hotels, business houses, and homes. The Texas government moved to Austin in October 1839.\nTwo days after the constitutional convention adjourned in March 1836, President Burnet had sent George Childress and Robert Hamilton, probably the wealthiest man in Texas to sign the Texas Declaration of Independence, to Washington to seek recognition of the new republic. These two men joined the three agents (Austin, Archer, and Wharton) already there. Childress and Hamilton met with Secretary of State John Forsyth, but they carried no official documents to prove that Texas had a de facto government, and he refused to negotiate. In May Burnet recalled all the agents and appointed James Collinsworth, who had been Burnet's secretary of state from April 29 to May 23, and Peter W. Grayson, the attorney general, to replace them. They were instructed to ask the United States to mediate to end the hostilities between Texas and Mexico and obtain recognition of Texas independence. They also were to stress the republic's interest in annexation. During the summer of 1836 President Jackson sent Henry M. Morfit, a State Department clerk, as a special agent to Texas to collect information on the republic's population, strength, and ability to maintain independence. In August, Morfit filed his report. He estimated the population at 30,000 Anglo-Americans, 3,478 Tejanos, 14,200 American Indians, of which 8,000 belonged to civilized tribes that had migrated from the United States, and a slave population of 5,000, plus a few free Blacks. The population was small, Texas independence was far from secure, the government had a heavy debt, and there was a vast tract of contested vacant land between the settlements and the Rio Grande. Morfit advised the United States to delay recognition. In his annual message to Congress on December 21, 1836, Jackson cited Morfit's report and stated that the United States traditionally had accorded recognition only when a new community could maintain its independence. Texas was threatened by \"an immense disparity of physical force on the side of Mexico,\" which might recover its lost dominion. Jackson left the disposition of the matter to Congress.\nIn the meantime, Houston, recently elected president of Texas, recalled Grayson and Collinsworth and dispatched William H. Wharton to Washington with instructions to seek recognition on both de jure and de facto grounds. If Wharton succeeded he would present his credentials as minister. Memucan Hunt soon joined him. They reported that Powhatan Ellis, United States minister to Mexico, had arrived in Washington and stated that Mexico was filled with anarchy, revolution, and bankruptcy. It would be impossible for her to invade Texas. France, Great Britain, and the United States were clamoring for the payment of claims of their citizens against Mexico. On March 1, 1837, the United States Congress, receiving memorials and petitions demanding the recognition of Texas independence, passed a resolution to provide money for \"a diplomatic agent\" to Texas. Jackson signed the resolution and appointed Alcée Louis La Branche of Louisiana to be chargé d'affaires to the Republic of Texas. The United States Congress adjourned on July 9, 1838, without acting upon the question of annexation. Houston replaced Hunt with Anson Jones, a member of the Texas Congress. Jones had introduced a resolution urging Houston to withdraw the offer of annexation, saying that Texas had grown in strength and resources and no longer needed ties with the United States. In Washington on October 12, 1838, Jones informed Secretary Forsyth that Texas had withdrawn its request for annexation. The issue lay dormant for several years.\nIn the fall of 1838 Houston sent James Pinckney Henderson abroad to seek recognition of Texas by England and France. The withdrawal of the annexation proposal in Washington helped facilitate his mission. France, being at war with Mexico, signed a treaty on September 25, 1839, recognizing Texas independence. England, in spite of slavery in the young republic and her desire to see the abolition of slavery worldwide, could not stand idly by and see France gain influence and trade privileges in Texas. Also, England had just settled the Maine boundary issue with the United States but faced hostilities over her claims in Oregon and the controversial Pacific Northwest boundary. She needed a supply of cotton if war came. In the fall of 1840, Lord Aberdeen announced that Her Majesty's government would recognize Texas independence, and on November 13–16, three treaties were signed that dealt with independence, commerce and navigation, and suppression of the African slave trade. A month earlier, on September 18, Texas had concluded a treaty of amity, commerce, and navigation with the Netherlands. The three treaties with England were not ratified until December 1841, soon after Houston's election for a second term to the Texas presidency. Houston named Ashbel Smith minister to Great Britain and France and sent James Reily to represent Texas in Washington, D.C. He instructed both men to get the three nations to exert pressure on Mexico for peace and recognition.\nDuring Houston's first administration (1836–38), the public debt of the republic soared from approximately $1,250,000 to $3,250,000. Houston's successor, Mirabeau B. Lamar, pursued aggressive policies toward Mexico and the Indians that added $4,855,000. In his second administration (1841–44) Houston and Congress pursued a policy of retrenchment and economy. The president abolished a number of offices in the government and in the army, combined or downgraded others, and cut salaries. Congress repealed the $5 million loan authorization voted earlier, as Texas had been unable to obtain money in the United States or Europe, and even reduced the pay of its own members. However, the Congress had overlooked an 1839 act that authorized the president to seek a loan of $1 million, and in June 1842, when he was considering a campaign against Mexico, Houston arranged to borrow that amount from Alexandre Bourgeois d'Orvanne of New Orleans. Congress also suspended payments on the public debt until the republic could meet its operating expenses. In his second term, Houston spent $511,000, only $100,000 of which went to Indian affairs. Though income slowly began to equal expenditures, at the time of annexation the public debt had risen to about $12 million.\nAlthough Texas had no incorporated or private bank during the days of the republic, an effort was made to form a monstrous banking institution. The first Congress granted a ninety-eight-year charter to the Texas Railroad, Navigation, and Banking Company, whose sponsors included a number of prominent Texans. The company could capitalize at $5 million, enjoy extensive banking privileges, and offer loans to build canals and railroads to connect the Rio Grande and Sabine River. Opposition to the company developed when Branch T. Archer, a sponsor, tried to pay into the Texas treasury in discounted paper money the $25,000 required in gold and silver to launch the bank. The bank became the first political issue in the Houston administration. The constitution empowered Congress to coin money and decreed that gold and silver coins would be lawful tender with the same value as in the United States. The republic, however, never minted any coins.\nTexas met her expenses in various ways. Officials sold confiscated and captured Mexican property and sought funds among well-wishers in the United States and elsewhere. The Bank of the United States in Philadelphia loaned the republic $457,380. Texas also sold land scrip in the United States for fifty cents an acre. As scrip sales were disappointing, Congress approved the issuance of paper money and, on June 9, 1837, authorized $500,000 in promissory notes bearing 10 percent interest and redeemable in twelve months. The notes began circulating on November 1. For note redemption, Congress pledged one-fourth of the proceeds from the sale of Matagorda and Galveston islands, a half million acres of public domain, all forfeited lands, and the faith of the republic. The notes were not to be reissued at maturity and depreciated very little. A replacement issue, called \"engraved interest notes,\" declined in value from sixty-five cents on the dollar in May 1838 to forty cents by January 1839. The total face value of notes placed in circulation in 1837–38 was $1,165,139. The treasury also accepted audited government drafts. The Texas Congress approved \"change notes\" (treasury notes) up to $10,000 and specified that customs duties be paid in specie or treasury notes. As imports exceeded exports, gold and silver quickly drained from the republic. During the Lamar administration (1838–41), to curtail smuggling and increase tariff collection, Congress lowered rates nearly to a free-trade basis, but saw no positive effect. Direct taxes and license fees could be paid in depreciated currency until February 1842. On January 19, 1839, Congress approved non-interest-bearing promissory notes, called \"red-backs.\" The treasury issued $2,780,361 in red-backs, valued at 37½ cents on the dollar in specie; these were worthless within three years. United States notes also circulated in Texas. Lamar appointed James Hamilton, a banker and former governor of South Carolina, to negotiate the authorized $5 million loan in either Europe or the United States, but Hamilton's attempts proved fruitless.\nAfter the defeat at San Jacinto, Mexico sought to stir up discontent in Texas. Military commanders knew that there were restless groups around Nacogdoches and among various Indian tribes, and sent agents to East Texas to promote dissension. In the late summer of 1838, a rebellion flared near Nacogdoches. Vicente Córdova, a prominent citizen, organized a Mexican-Indian combination and disclaimed allegiance to Texas. Maj. Gen. Thomas J. Rusk, the local militia commander, called for volunteers. Córdova boldly attacked Rusk's camp on September 16, but was repulsed. In early March of 1839, with fifty-three Mexicans, a few American Indians, and six Blacks, Córdova sought to travel from the upper Trinity along the frontier to Matamoros. Near Austin, scouts discovered his trail, and Col. Edward Burleson at Bastrop gathered eighty men and broke up the Córdova party on Mill Creek near the Guadalupe River. In May, Manuel Flores, a Mexican agent, left Matamoros to contact Córdova, unaware of his flight. Texas Rangers intercepted Flores's party near Onion Creek, killed the emissary, and dispersed his men.\nUpon taking office in December 1838, Lamar was convinced that the Cherokees were in treasonable correspondence with the Mexicans, and launched a campaign that drove them from Texas. Soldiers also forced the Shawnees, Alabamas, and Coushattas to abandon their hunting grounds; the last two tribes were given lands in East Texas. Speculators and settlers swarmed into vacated Indian land. Lamar also wanted to end Comanche depredations on the frontier. In 1839 ranger parties based in San Antonio invaded Comanche country and fought several engagements. Aware of the Cherokee expulsion, the Comanches sent a small delegation to San Antonio to talk peace. Texas authorities agreed to negotiate if the Indians brought in their White captives. On March 19, 1840, sixty-five Comanches showed up with one White prisoner, a twelve-year old girl by the name of Matilda Lockhart. Matilda said the Comanches had other prisoners. The Texans demanded the remaining prisoners and tried to hold the Indians as hostages. In what became known as the Council House Fight, thirty-five Indians and seven Texans were killed. Furious over the massacre, the Comanches killed their captives and descended several hundred strong on San Antonio but were unable to coax a fight and therefore rode away. Beginning in July the Comanches hit the frontier counties in force, with some 1,000 warriors descending the Guadalupe valley toward the coast. At Plum Creek, near the site of present Lockhart, Capt. Mathew Caldwell, Col. Edward Burleson, and General Felix Huston combined their forces and scattered the marauders (see PLUM CREEK, BATTLE OF). In October Col. John H. Moore attacked Comanche camps west of the settlement line. Near the site of present-day Colorado City, his force surprised and killed more than 130 Indians.\nIn his second term as president, Sam Houston continued to negotiate with the Indian tribes and sought to rescue White captives. His policy of conciliation proved successful and was far less expensive than Lamar's policy. In August 1842, Houston tried to contact the Apaches and other tribes in Northwest Texas, and in October he met the Lipan Apaches and Tonkawas at the Waco village (see WICHITA INDIANS) on the Brazos. The president wanted to establish trading houses on the Brazos, believing that these establishments, lying west of the settlements, would provide protection. Coffee's Station, opened in 1837 on the Red River on a north-south Indian trail, had been successful. John F. Torrey started posts at Austin, San Antonio, and New Braunfels and near Waco. Houston became a stockholder in the Torrey trading houses. On September 29, 1843, Edward H. Tarrant and George W. Terrell concluded a treaty with nine Indian tribes at Bird's Fort near the site of present Arlington. The Senate ratified the treaty, but the government made no demarcation line between White and Indian territory. The largest Indian council held in the republic met in October 1844 near Waco, where a treaty was concluded with the Waco, Tawakoni, Kichai, and Wichita Indians.\nPresidents of the republic could not succeed themselves. Toward the end of Houston's first term as president, which ended on December 10, 1838, Lamar announced his candidacy. Houston supporters tried to get Rusk to run, but he refused. Also Rusk lacked two months meeting the constitutional age requirement. Houston supporters next endorsed Peter W. Grayson, the attorney general, who had worked in Washington, but on his way back to Texas Grayson committed suicide at Bean's Station in eastern Tennessee. The Houstonites then approached Chief Justice James Collinsworth, but in late July he fell overboard in Galveston Bay and drowned. Lamar campaigned vigorously, promised to remedy the mistakes of the Houston administration, and won by a vote of 6,995 to 252 over Senator Robert Wilson, who represented Liberty and Harrisburg (later Harris) counties. David Burnet, the former ad interim president, was elected vice president. At the Lamar inaugural in Houston on December 10, Houston appeared in colonial costume and powdered wig and gave a three-hour \"Farewell Address.\" Algernon P. Thompson, Lamar's secretary, reported that the new president was indisposed and read his inaugural remarks. Lamar picked Barnard E. Bee to be secretary of state, retained Robert Barr as postmaster general, asked Albert Sidney Johnston to be secretary of war, and made Memucan Hunt secretary of the navy. Richard G. Dunlap and John C. Watrous were appointed secretary of the treasury and attorney general, respectively.\nIn his message to the Texas Congress on December 21, President Lamar spoke against annexation. He saw no value in a tie with the United States, and predicted that Texas could someday become a great nation extending to the Pacific. Lamar called for far-reaching public programs. He recommended the establishment of a national bank, owned and operated by the government, and urged the establishment of public free schools and the founding of a university. He wanted the municipal code reformed to coordinate Mexican and United States law in the republic. He also wanted increased protection for the western frontier. He declared that neither the native nor the immigrant tribes had a cause of complaint and denied that the Cherokees or others had legal claims to land. Lamar recommended the building of military posts along the frontier, and the formation of a permanent military force capable of protecting the nation's borders. He promised to prosecute the war against Mexico until Mexico recognized Texas independence. He stated that Texas needed a navy to protect its commerce on the high seas and urged legislation to reserve all minerals for government use as well as a program to turn them to the advantage of the nation. Lamar favored continuing the tariff, but hoped some day to see Texas ports free and open. Congress responded to his message by authorizing a force of fifteen companies to be stationed in military colonies at eight places on the frontier. These were to be located on the Red River, at the Three Forks of the Trinity, on the Brazos, on the Colorado River, on the Saint Marks (San Marcos) River, near the headwaters of Cibolo Creek, on the Frio River, and on the Nueces. At each site, three leagues of land was to be surveyed into 160-acre tracts, and each soldier who fulfilled his enlistment would receive a tract. Bona fide settlers who lived on the land for three years also would be given tracts. In addition, the government planned to build sixteen trading posts near the settlement line. On January 1, 1839, the Texas Congress authorized Lamar to enroll eight companies of mounted volunteers for six months' service and appropriated $75,000 to sustain the force. Congress also set aside $5,000 to recruit and maintain a company of fifty-six rangers to patrol western Gonzales County for three months and three mounted companies for immediate service against the hostile Indians in Bastrop, Milam, and Robertson counties. An additional two companies were to protect San Patricio, Goliad, and Refugio counties. Congress appropriated a million dollars in promissory notes to cover the expenses for these units.\nAt the beginning of the Lamar administration Mexico was temporarily distracted. Because of unresolved French claims the French Navy had blockaded the Mexican coast and shelled and captured Veracruz. The Centralist Mexican government also faced a revolt by Federalists in its northern states. Tension increased when Lamar threatened to launch an offensive against Mexico if that nation refused to recognize Texas independence. Texan military units under colonels Reuben Ross, Juan N. Seguin and William S. Fisher crossed the Rio Grande and joined the Mexican Federalists, ignoring Lamar's call to return. In February 1839 Lamar increased the pressure on Mexico. He appointed Secretary of State Bee minister extraordinary and plenipotentiary to Mexico to request recognition of Texas independence and to conclude a treaty of peace, amity, and commerce. Bee also was to seek an agreement fixing the national boundary at the Rio Grande from its mouth to its source. If Mexico refused these requests, Bee could offer $5 million for the territory that Texas claimed by the act of December 19, 1836, territory that lay outside the bounds recognized by Mexican law. When Bee reached Veracruz, the French had withdrawn and the Centralists were strengthening their position. However, Juan Vitalba, a secret agent of Santa Anna who was serving temporarily as president, made overtures and hinted at possible negotiations. Lamar asked James Treat, a former resident of Mexico who knew Santa Anna and other Mexican leaders, to act as a confidential agent and attempt negotiations. Treat reached Veracruz on November 28, 1839, when the Federalists and their Texan allies were at the gates of Matamoros. The alliance blocked his plans. A year later, in September 1840, Treat proposed to the Mexican minister of foreign affairs an extended armistice but was ignored.\nA Mexican invasion of Texas was now rumored. Gen. Felix Huston proposed sending an expedition of 1,000 men into Chihuahua, believing the move would eventually force any Mexican army that crossed the Rio Grande downstream to withdraw. Congress did not act, however, and in March 1841 Lamar appointed James Webb, former attorney general, to replace Bee as secretary of state and sent him to Mexico. Webb was denied permission to land at Veracruz. On June 29, the president recommended that Texas recognize the independence of Yucatán and Tabasco and join in a declaration of war against Mexico. Lamar also urged attention to the upper part of the Rio Grande. The Fifth Congress debated bills but refused to finance an expedition to establish Texas authority over its far-western claims. Congress also failed to appropriate money to maintain the army, and Lamar disbanded the military on March 24, 1841.\nIn November, with a large amount of military equipment on hand, the president urged Congress to authorize an expedition to Santa Fe. Lamar believed that the New Mexicans were restless under Governor Manuel Armijo. In April 1840 he had addressed a letter to the citizens of Santa Fe, saying that the United States and France had recognized Texas independence, and that he hoped to send commissioners to explain his concern for their wellbeing. When Santa Fe did not respond, Lamar was determined to send an expedition. He believed that Texas must extend its authority over its western claims, divert a part of the Santa Fe -St. Louis trade through its ports, and encourage the 80,000 inhabitants of New Mexico to sever their ties with Mexico and turn to Texas. If the United States took over New Mexico, however, it would extend its influence to the Pacific and complicate the Texas claims. On June 20, 1841, a large caravan, officially designated the Santa Fe Pioneers, left the Austin vicinity. Dr. Richard F. Brenham, William G. Cooke, and José Antonio Navarro traveled along as commissioners to treat with the inhabitants of New Mexico. Gen. Hugh McLeod commanded a military escort of 270 men. The civilian component included fifty-one persons, principally merchants, traders, and teamsters, with twenty-one wagons. After crossing the vast plains of West Texas under great hardship, on September 17 the expedition reached the village of Anton Chico, east of Santa Fe. There they met Armijo's forces and surrendered. The Mexicans marched the prisoners to Mexico City and held them until the following April.\nThe Lamar administration was drawing to an end. When the Sixth Congress assembled in Austin on November 1, 1841, the Rio Grande frontier was the scene of constant attacks by Texas renegades and Mexican outlaws and the nation was heavily in debt. Texans were in low spirits, the economy was depressed, and some families even considered moving back to the United States. During these years Texas regarded its vast public domain as critical to attracting settlers and encouraging economic development. On January 1, 1840, Congress passed a law permitting the president to issue colonization contracts to individuals or groups who would introduce a specified number of families within three years. A year later, Congress discussed a bill to allow the Franco-Texian Commercial and Colonization Company (also called the Franco-Texienne Company) to bring in 8,000 families and build twenty forts from the Red River to the Rio Grande. The settlers would be exempted from all taxes and tariffs for twenty years. The company would receive three million acres of land divided into sixteen tracts and have trading privileges with the New Mexican settlements. The bill passed the House but died in the Senate. Lamar approved a number of colonization contracts, however. On August 30, 1841, he authorized William S. Peters and his associates to settle 600 families from the Ohio valley and northeastern states on the northern frontier south of the Red River. Heads of families would each receive 640 acres of land and single men 320 acres. The settler would received title to half his land, while the contractor would hold the rest to pay for surveying, securing titles, furnishing seed, powder and shot, and providing a cabin. Other grants were made. On February 9, 1842, William Kennedy, an Englishman, with William Pringle, the Frenchman Henri Castro, and others each received permission to settle 600 or more immigrants between the Nueces and the Rio Grande. Castro sent out 300 colonists, principally from Alsace, to settle on the Medina River at Castroville. By 1845 he had introduced a total of 2,134 settlers. Kennedy and his associates planned to place families south of the Nueces River, but the colony never materialized.\nDuring his second administration, Houston continued the settlement program. To strengthen frontier defense, he signed a contract on June 7, 1842 with Alexandre Bourgeois d'Orvanne and Armand Ducos to settle 600 French families on the headwaters of the Medina and Frio rivers and 500 families along the lower Rio Grande. Two Germans, Henry F. Fisher and Burchard Miller, contracted to locate 1,000 families of Germans, Swiss, Danes, Swedes, Norwegians, and Dutch immigrants between the Llano and Colorado rivers. The grant covered about three million acres, but the contractors introduced very few settlers. The Adelsverein, or Association of Noblemen, was one of the most successful colonizing enterprises. Twenty-five German noblemen organized a company at Biebrich am Rhein in April 1842, and sent agents to Texas to confer with President Houston, but they failed to obtain a grant. On March 22, 1844, the association acquired a large tract west of San Antonio from Bourgeois d'Orvanne and sent Prince Carl of Solms-Braunfels as commissioner general to Texas. Informed that the Bourgeois grant had been forfeited, Solms purchased the Fisher-Miller Land Grant, 3,878,000 acres that ran along the Colorado River and west to the Llano River. Solms also obtained a tract at the junction of Cibolo Creek and the San Antonio River. To establish a station halfway to the Fisher-Miller grant, he bought the so-called Comal Tract and founded the town of New Braunfels. In 1846 John O. Meusebach, who succeeded Solms-Braunfels as agent, founded Fredericksburg on the Pedernales River. Although after five years the Adelsverein went bankrupt, it had brought 7,380 immigrants to Texas. Charles Fenton Mercer, an agent of the Peters colony, contracted in January 1844 to settle 100 families within five years on any unappropriated lands in the republic. A number of families came in, but controversy and lawsuits plagued both the contractor and the settlers from the beginning and into the 1930s.\nDuring the period of the republic, the population of Texas increased about 7,000 per year, primarily from immigration. By 1847 the White population, including Mexican immigrants, had risen to 102,961, and the number of slaves to 38,753. The growth was due largely to liberal land policies and expanding opportunities. Like other frontier areas, Texas acquired a reputation as a land of sharp dealers, lawlessness, rowdiness, and fraudulence. Land frauds were numerous and law enforcement agencies were weak or nonexistent, but Texans developed an ability to handle challenges. They elected few demagogues to office and were remarkably fortunate in their choice of leaders.\nEarly in his administration, Lamar promoted public education. On January 26, 1839, Congress set aside three square leagues of land in each county to support primary schools or academies. It also assigned fifty leagues of land for two universities. The next year the county allotment was increased to four leagues, and teachers were required to provide certificates indicating they could teach the basic courses. The republic, however, failed to establish a public school system or to found a university. Private and denominational schools filled the void. The first Protestant church-related school was Rutersville University, near La Grange, opened in January 1840 by Methodists. Congress provided a charter and four leagues of land. The school had preparatory and female departments, and added college work for men. During the republic, Rutersville was the foremost college in Texas. In 1842 the University of San Augustine, at San Augustine in East Texas, opened with a grammar school and female and collegiate departments. It prided itself on its laboratory work in science. McKenzie College, started near Clarksville in 1841, at one time had more than 300 boarding students. Marshall University, a coeducational institution, received its charter in 1842. Its female department eventually became a separate institution. Nacogdoches University, probably the first nonsectarian institution of higher learning in Texas, chartered on February 3, 1845, had an endowment of 29,712 acres of land and $2,699 in personal property. That same month Baylor University was opened near Independence.\nIn the fall of 1841 Houston and Burnet were candidates for president. Campaign issues included the Franco-Texian Bill, promoted by Houston; Houston and Burnet's questionable role in making land grants; frontier protection; making Houston the capital; instituting reforms to ensure land titles; retrenchment; and the redemption of the nation's honor, desecrated by Mexico. Houston was pictured as representing eastern Texas (except Nacogdoches County, where the Cherokee land question made Burnet the favorite), while Burnet was the champion of the western counties. On September 6 Houston easily won a second term, and Burleson beat Hunt for vice president.\nIn his second administration, Houston reversed many of Lamar's policies. He sought peace treaties with the Indians, took a defensive stand against Mexico, and encouraged trade along the southern and western borders. Houston was vitally concerned with the location of the capital. Austin was on the frontier, far from the center of population. If Indian or Mexican intruders captured and burned the capital, the prestige of the government would suffer. Houston wanted the government returned to Houston, but the western counties protested and Congress balked. In early March 1842, when Gen. Rafael Vásquez crossed the Rio Grande with 700 soldiers and occupied San Antonio, Houston seized the opportunity to order removal of the national archives from Austin, but local citizens blocked the move. During the session of Congress called to discuss the Vásquez invasion, Houston brought up the moving of the capital, but had no success. In October he moved the government offices to Washington-on-the-Brazos. In late December, at the president's orders, Col. Thomas W. Ward, commissioner of the General Land Office, loaded the archives into wagons and sought to remove them to the new seat of government. Irate citizens overtook Ward at Kenney's Fort on Brushy Creek and retrieved the documents. The Texas seat of government remained at Washington-on-the-Brazos until July 1845.\nTexas had two navies during its short history as a nation. The first was commanded by Charles E. Hawkins, who carried the title of commodore. To protect the supply line to New Orleans, on November 25, 1835, the General Council of the provisional government authorized the purchase of four schooners and granted letters of marque and reprisal to privateers until the ships were armed. The first navy included the 60-ton Liberty, the 125-ton Independence, the 125-ton Brutus, and the 125-ton Invincible. All four ships were lost by mid-1837. Early in 1838 Texas bought the merchant brig Potomac, but was unable to convert it to a man-of-war, and instead used it at the Galveston Navy Yard as a receiving vessel. In March 1839 the government converted the S.S. Charleston, a steam side-wheeler, into a man-of-war, rechristened it the Zavala, and sent it on a cruise to Yucatán. It ran aground in Galveston Bay in May 1842 and subsequently was sold for scrap.\nLamar established the second Texas navy. The fleet of six vessels included the schooners San Jacinto, San Antonio, and San Bernard, each 170 tons; the brigs Wharton and Archer, 400 tons each; and the sloop-of-war Austin, 600 tons. Commodore Edwin W. Moore made the Austin his flagship. In October 1840 the Texas Congress, lulled by an unofficial armistice, cut navy appropriations and tied up the fleet. The San Jacinto, mapping the Texas coast, was wrecked the same month. A year later, on September 18, 1841, Lamar agreed to participate in Yucatán's rebellion against Mexico and sent the navy to protect the Yucatán coast. Yucatán paid $8,000 a month to keep the fleet active. On becoming president again, Houston canceled Lamar's arrangements and ordered the fleet to sail home. The San Antonio reached Galveston on January 31, 1842, reported on Yucatecan matters, and went on to New Orleans for repairs. There the only mutiny in the Texas Navy occurred. United States authorities captured the mutineers, and Commodore Moore later court-martialed two of the men. In April Moore arrived in New Orleans and began haggling with Houston over repair bills. In February 1843, Moore learned that Yucatán would pay these bills and sailed for Campeche. Houston, who had been planning to sell the navy, declared Moore a pirate. The commodore settled his accounts with Yucatán and returned home. After trial by a court-martial, he was restored to command. Houston ordered the vessels decommissioned. At annexation, the Texas Navy was transferred to the United States Navy, which promptly sold all the vessels except the Austin. Other vessels of the Texas Navy had been abandoned in Galveston harbor, lost at sea, or wrecked by storm. The United States Navy refused to accept the Texas naval officers and canceled their commissions.\nOn October 9, 1841, Santa Anna reestablished himself as provisional president of Mexico and determined to renew hostilities against Texas. In early January of 1842, Gen. Mariano Arista, commanding the Army of the North, announced his intention of invading the \"the Department of Texas.\" After Vásquez seized San Antonio in March, the western counties demanded a retaliatory strike at Mexico. Houston knew that such a campaign could not be sustained, but decided to let the agitators see for themselves. On March 17 he approved the undertaking and sent agents to the United States to recruit volunteers and obtain arms, munitions, and provisions. The soldiers, assembling under Gen. James Davis at Lipantitlán, on the Nueces near San Patricio, quickly became restless. Provisions were short, and gambling and drunkenness prevailed. Learning of the disorder, colonels Antonio Canales and Cayetano Montero camped on the Rio Grande near Mier and Camargo and launched a surprise attack on the Texan camp on July 7, but were beaten off. The Sixth Congress, meeting in special session, passed a \"war bill,\" but Houston vetoed it as it appropriated no funds for the campaign. The army was disbanded.\nThe Mexican government was determined to keep the Texas frontier in turmoil. Santa Anna ordered Gen. Adrián Woll to attack San Antonio and informed the Mexican Congress that he planned to resubjugate Texas. Woll crossed the Rio Grande at Presidio del Río Grande (Eagle Pass), and made a surprise attack on San Antonio on the morning of September 11. The defenders, learning that the soldiers were Mexican regulars, surrendered. On the eighteenth Woll moved to Salado Creek, assaulted the Texans assembled on the creek east of San Antonio under Col. Mathew Caldwell, then withdrew to San Antonio. Mexican troops intercepted Capt. Nicholas M. Dawson and fifty-three volunteers from La Grange who tried to join Caldwell east of Salado Creek; the Mexicans killed thirty-six Texans and captured fifteen, of whom five were wounded. Two escaped from the battlefield. Woll sent fifty-two prisoners from San Antonio ahead to Mexico, evacuated San Antonio on the twentieth, and marched for the Rio Grande. Caldwell's forces and a small ranger party under Capt. John Coffee \"Jack\" Hays harassed the Mexicans as far as the Nueces River. After the battle of Salado Creek, Texans demanded retaliation and rushed to San Antonio as individuals, in companies, and in small groups. Houston sent Brig. Gen. Alexander Somervell to take charge of the force there. On November 25 Somervell headed for the border with more than 750 men and seized Laredo. Disgusted by the Texans' plundering, 187 men soon left for home. In December Somervell led the rest downriver, crossed the Rio Grande, and seized Guerrero. Unable to find provisions, he recrossed into Texas and ordered his men to prepare to return home. A large group, 309 men, broke off from the expedition and refused to return home. They organized under Col. William S. Fisher and marched down the east side of the Rio Grande, crossed the river opposite Mier, and demanded food and clothing from the inhabitants of Mier. A large body of Mexican troops was rushed to the town, and the Texans, facing odds of ten to one, surrendered on December 26. On their march to Mexico City, the prisoners overthrew their guards at Hacienda Salado, and sought to escape to Texas, but most of them were recaptured. Nicolás Bravo, the vice president, ordered that they be decimated. Seventeen drew black beans and were shot on March 25, 1843.\nLike Lamar, Houston expressed concern over the western boundaries of Texas. In February 1843 his administration authorized Jacob Snively to raise a volunteer group to make a show of force in the northwest territory claimed by Texas. They hoped to prey on the Mexican caravans traveling that section of the Santa Fe Trail that crossed Texas territory. The men were to mount, arm, and equip themselves and share half the spoils; the other half would go to the republic. Earlier, in August 1842, Charles A. Warfield had received a similar commission, recruited a small party largely in Missouri, and briefly occupied the New Mexican town of Mora on the overland trail. Snively organized 175 men near Coffee's Station, on the Red River, and in April 1843 they rode north. From his camp about forty miles below where the Santa Fe Trail crossed the Arkansas River, Snively captured a New Mexican patrol guarding the trail. The ensuing foray was short-lived. Capt. Philip St. George Cooke, in command of United States dragoons escorting merchant caravans through Indian country, arrested and disarmed the Texans, allegedly for being on United States soil, and sent them home. The United States later paid for the arms they had taken from the Texans.\nInternal disturbances also flared during Houston's second term. In Shelby County, Charles W. Jackson, a fugitive from Louisiana, ran for Congress and blamed his defeat on land sharks and counterfeiters of headright certificates. Joseph G. Goodbread, who headed the anti-Jackson faction, threatened to run him out of the country. In 1842 Jackson shot and killed Goodbread. At Jackson's trial, in Harrison County, the judge failed to appear on the second day and Jackson went free. He soon headed a force called the \"Regulators,\" who sought to suppress crime in the area and harass Goodbread supporters. In response, Edward Merchant formed the \"Moderators.\" In the spring of 1843 a civil war broke out between the factions in Shelby, Panola, and Harrison counties. Over the three following years more than fifty men were killed and numerous homes and other property were burnt or destroyed. Judge John M. Hansford was killed by the Regulators. In August 1844, President Houston called on both parties to lay down their arms and sent Travis G. Brooks and 600 militiamen to maintain order. They arrested leaders on both sides and took them to San Augustine, where Houston persuaded them to sign a peace agreement.\nWhile in Perote Prison, James W. Robinson, a former acting governor of Texas during the Consultation, sought an interview with Santa Anna. He stated that if granted an audience, he could show how to arrange a lasting peace between Mexico and Texas. Santa Anna, being at war with Yucatán, agreed to hear Robinson. Under his proposals Texas would become an independent department (state) in the Mexican federation, be represented in the Mexican Congress, and be allowed to make its own laws. Texas would be granted amnesty for past acts against Mexico, and Mexico would station no troops in Texas. The Mexican president approved the proposals on February 18, 1843, and released Robinson to convey them to Texas. Houston studied the proposals and reasoned that Santa Anna's Yucatán problem might lead the Mexican president to agree to peace terms. Houston asked Charles Elliot, the British chargé d'affaires to Texas, to ask Richard Pakenham, the British minister in Mexico, to seek an armistice. Robinson wrote Santa Anna that Houston wanted an armistice of several months to give the people of Texas an opportunity to consider the proposals. When Santa Anna received Robinson's letter, he agreed to a truce. Houston proclaimed an armistice on June 15, 1843, and sent Samuel M. Williams and George W. Hockley as commissioners to meet their counterparts at Sabinas, near the Rio Grande. They were to arrange a general armistice and request that a commission meet in Mexico City to discuss a permanent peace. Houston was cautious and proclaimed martial law between the Nueces and the Rio Grande. Pakenham informed Houston that Santa Anna would release the Mier prisoners if the Texas president would release all Mexican prisoners. Houston ordered the prisoners released, but when no Mexicans arrived on the Rio Grande, Santa Anna canceled the exchange. The Texas and Mexican commissioners agreed on a permanent armistice on February 18, 1844, but Houston filed the document away without taking action because it referred to Texas as a Mexican department.\nIn the Texas presidential race of 1844, Vice President Edward Burleson faced Secretary of State Anson Jones, who had the support of Houston. Jones won by a large vote. After he was inaugurated on December 9, he launched a policy of economy, peaceful relations with the Indians, and a nonaggressive policy toward Mexico. As his administration also tackled the issue of annexation, Jones earned the sobriquet \"Architect of Annexation.\" He, Houston, and their supporters knew that proper timing was essential in securing annexation. Upon taking office, Jones instructed Isaac Van Zandt, Texan chargé d'affaires to the United States, to decline all offers to negotiate an annexation treaty until it was known that the United States Senate definitely would ratify it. When President John Tyler reopened negotiations on annexation, Mexico became friendly to Texas. At the same time she threatened war with the United States if annexation were approved. In the United States, there was great sympathy for the Texas cause. The collapse of the Santa Fe expedition in 1841 and the Mexican invasions of 1842 had attracted widespread attention. In March 1842, Houston instructed James Reily, the Texas representative to Washington, to sound out the government on annexation. The United States, knowing the British wanted to mediate Texas-Mexican difficulties, saw a strong British influence looming in Texas affairs. President Tyler, a Whig with Southern views on slavery, had indicated in October that he wanted to open discussions leading to the annexation of Texas by treaty. An annexation treaty was completed on April 12, 1844, and signed by Secretary of State John C. Calhoun, Isaac Van Zandt, and Van Zandt's assistant, J. Pinckney Henderson.\nGreat Britain and France became concerned. The British Foreign Office, with French support, advised Ashbel Smith, the Texan agent to Great Britain and France, that a \"diplomatic act\" was needed to force Mexico to make peace with Texas and recognize its independence. They wanted the United States to join their efforts to end Texas-Mexican hostilities. Pakenham, however, opposed the plan, and the matter was dropped. Houston favored a \"diplomatic act,\" but Anson Jones, the president elect, balked. Jones wanted annexation and thought that the threat of an alignment with England, connected with the cotton trade, was the key to achieving it. In June 1844 the United States Senate voted thirty-five to sixteen to reject the treaty.\nThe annexation of Texas also became a major issue in the United States election of 1844. The Democrats ran James K. Polk, of Tennessee, for president with the campaign slogan \"the Re-Annexation of Texas and the Re-Occupation of Oregon,\" hoping to capture the expansionists' vote both North and South. The Democrats won by a large vote. Tyler viewed Polk's election as a mandate for immediate annexation. In his annual message on December 2, he urged Congress to approve annexation by a joint resolution, which Congress passed on February 28, 1845, and Tyler signed on March 1. He then dispatched Andrew Jackson Donelson, a nephew of Andrew Jackson, to Texas with instructions to press for its acceptance. The terms were generous. Texas would be annexed as a slave state rather than as a territory. She would keep her public lands and pay her own public debts. She could divide herself into as many as four additional states. The terms of annexation had to be accepted by January 1, 1846. In May 1845, the United States dispatched a fleet of warships to protect the Texas coast.\nThe British chargé d'affaires and the French minister asked President Jones to postpone action on the annexation agreement for ninety days because they wanted to arrange a settlement of matters between Mexico and Texas. Jones agreed to do so on March 29. The British and French emissaries reached Mexico City in mid-April. Luis G. Cuevas, minister of foreign relations, placed their proposals before the Mexican Congress, and in late April Mexico recognized Texas independence. The British minister handed a copy of the document to Jones on June 4, and he immediately announced a preliminary peace with Mexico. On the same day Jones signed a peace treaty with the last Comanche chief whose tribe had been at war with Texas, thus ending Indian hostilities for the republic.\nPresident Jones issued a call on May 5 for a convention to be elected by the people to meet in Austin on July 4. At his call, the Texas Congress assembled on June 16 in special session at Washington-on-the-Brazos and rejected the Mexican offer for peace. They accepted the annexation agreement and approved elections for a convention. The convention met in Austin on July 4 and passed an ordinance to accept annexation. It then drafted the Constitution of 1845 and submitted both the annexation agreement and proposed constitution to a popular vote. On October 13 annexation was approved by a vote of 4,245 to 257, and the constitution by a vote of 4,174 to 312. The United States Congress approved the Texas state constitution, and Polk signed the act admitting Texas as a state on December 29, 1845. The fledgling republic, whose existence had spanned nine years, eleven months, and seventeen days, was no more. In a special election on December 15, Texans had elected officers for the new state government. The First Legislature convened in Austin on February 19, 1846. In a ceremony in front of the Capitol, President Jones gave a valedictory address, the flag of the republic was lowered, and the flag of the United States was raised above it. The ceremonies concluded with the inaugural address of the newly elected governor, J. Pinckney Henderson. By annexation Texas received the protection of a powerful country and the assurance of a bright future.\nSee also ANGLO-AMERICAN COLONIZATION, ARCHIVES WAR, BANKS AND BANKING, BLACK BEAN EPISODE, BOUNDARIES, CAPITALS, CHEROKEE WAR, DEBT OF THE REPUBLIC OF TEXAS, DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS OF THE REPUBLIC OF TEXAS, FLAGS OF TEXAS, GOVERNMENT, INDIAN CAPTIVES, INDIAN RELATIONS, INDIANS, LAND GRANTS, MEXICAN TEXAS, MIER EXPEDITION, OFFICERS OF THE REPUBLIC OF TEXAS , REPUBLIC OF TEXAS MARINE CORPS, SEALS OF TEXAS, SOMERVELL EXPEDITION, REGULATOR-MODERATOR WAR, TEXAN SANTA FE EXPEDITION, TEXAS NAVY, TEXAS REVOLUTION, and TREATIES OF VELASCO.\nWilliam Campbell Binkley, The Expansionist Movement in Texas, 1836–1850 (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1925).

            "report_content": "Tennessee (/ˌtɛnəˈsiː/ (listen),[7][8] locally /ˈtɛnɪsi/[9]), officially the State of Tennessee, is a state in the Southeastern region of the United States. Tennessee is the 36th largest by area and the 16th most populous of the 50 states. It is bordered by Kentucky to the north, Virginia to the northeast, North Carolina to the east, Georgia, Alabama, and Mississippi to the south, Arkansas to the southwest, and Missouri to the northwest. Tennessee is geographically, culturally, and legally divided into three Grand Divisions of East, Middle, and West Tennessee. Nashville is the state's capital and largest city, and anchors its largest metropolitan area. Tennessee's population as of the 2020 United States census is approximately 6.9 million.[10]\nTennessee is rooted in the Watauga Association, a 1772 frontier pact generally regarded as the first constitutional government west of the Appalachian Mountains.[11] Its name derives from \"Tanasi\", a Cherokee town in the eastern part of the state that existed before the first European American settlement.[12] Tennessee was initially part of North Carolina, and later the Southwest Territory, before its admission to the Union as the 16th state on June 1, 1796. It earned the nickname \"The Volunteer State\" early in its history due to a strong tradition of military service.[13] A slave state until the American Civil War, Tennessee was politically divided, with its western and middle parts supporting the Confederacy and the eastern region harboring pro-Union sentiment. As a result, Tennessee was the last state to secede and the first readmitted to the Union after the war.[14]\nDuring the 20th century, Tennessee transitioned from a predominantly agrarian society to a more diversified economy. This was aided in part by massive federal investment in the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) and the city of Oak Ridge, which was established during World War II to house the Manhattan Project's uranium enrichment facilities for the construction of the world's first atomic bombs. These were dropped on Imperial Japan at the end of the war. After the war, the Oak Ridge National Laboratory became a key center of scientific research. In 2016, the element tennessine was named for the state, largely in recognition of the roles played by Oak Ridge, Vanderbilt University, and the University of Tennessee in its discovery.[15] Tennessee has also played a major role in the development of many forms of popular music, including country, blues, rock and roll, soul, and gospel.\nTennessee has diverse terrain and landforms, and from east to west, contains a mix of cultural features characteristic of Appalachia, the Upland South, and the Deep South. The Blue Ridge Mountains along the eastern border reach some of the highest elevations in eastern North America, and the Cumberland Plateau contains many scenic valleys and waterfalls. The central part of the state is marked by cavernous bedrock and irregular rolling hills, and level, fertile plains define West Tennessee. The state is twice bisected by the Tennessee River, and the Mississippi River forms its western border. Its economy is dominated by the health care, music, finance, automotive, chemical, electronics, and tourism sectors, and cattle, soybeans, corn, poultry, and cotton are its primary agricultural products.[16] The Great Smoky Mountains National Park, the nation's most visited national park, is in eastern Tennessee.[17]\nThe name Tennessee derives from the Cherokee settlement of Tanasi (ᏔᎾᏏ), whose etymology is uncertain.[18] Spanish conquistador Juan Pardo recorded a village called \"Tanasqui\" during his expedition in 1567, but it is unknown whether that was the same settlement as Tanasi.[19] According to ethnographer James Mooney, the name \"cannot be analyzed\", and its meaning is lost.[20] The modern spelling is attributed to James Glen, the governor of South Carolina, who used it in his official correspondence during the 1750s. The spelling was popularized by the publication of Henry Timberlake's Draught of the Cherokee Country in 1765. In 1788, North Carolina created \"Tennessee County\", the third county to be established in what is now Middle Tennessee. When a constitutional convention met in 1796 to organize a new state out of the Southwest Territory, it adopted \"Tennessee\" as the name of the state.[21]\nThe first inhabitants of Tennessee were Paleo-Indians who arrived about 12,000 years ago at the end of the Last Glacial Period. Archaeological excavations indicate that the lower Tennessee Valley was heavily populated by Ice Age hunter-gatherers, and Middle Tennessee is believed to have been rich with game animals such as mastodons.[22] The names of the cultural groups who inhabited the area before European contact are unknown, but archaeologists have named several distinct cultural phases, including the Archaic (8000–1000 BC), Woodland (1000 BC–1000 AD), and Mississippian (1000–1600 AD) periods.[23] The Archaic peoples first domesticated dogs, and plants such as squash, corn, gourds, and sunflowers were first grown in Tennessee during the Woodland period.[24] Later generations of Woodland peoples constructed the first mounds. Rapid civilizational development occurred during the Mississippian period, when Indigenous peoples developed organized chiefdoms and constructed numerous ceremonial structures throughout the state.[25]\nSpanish conquistadors who explored the region in the 16th century encountered some of the Mississippian peoples, including the Muscogee Creek, Yuchi, and Shawnee.[26][27] By the early 18th century, most Natives in Tennessee had disappeared, most likely wiped out by diseases introduced by the Spaniards.[26] The Cherokee began migrating into what is now eastern Tennessee from what is now Virginia in the latter 17th century, possibly to escape expanding European settlement and diseases in the north.[28] They forced the Creek, Yuchi, and Shawnee out of the state in the early 18th century.[28][29] The Chickasaw remained confined to West Tennessee, and the middle part of the state contained few Native Americans, although both the Cherokee and the Shawnee claimed the region as their hunting ground.[30] Cherokee peoples in Tennessee were known by European settlers as the Overhill Cherokee because they lived west of the Blue Ridge Mountains.[31] Overhill settlements grew along the rivers in East Tennessee in the early 18th century.[32]\nThe first recorded European expeditions into what is now Tennessee were led by Spanish explorers Hernando de Soto in 1540–1541, Tristan de Luna in 1559, and Juan Pardo in 1566–1567.[33][34][35] In 1673, English fur trader Abraham Wood sent an expedition from the Colony of Virginia into Overhill Cherokee territory in modern-day northeastern Tennessee.[36][37] That same year, a French expedition led by missionary Jacques Marquette and Louis Jolliet explored the Mississippi River and became the first Europeans to map the Mississippi Valley.[37][36] In 1682, an expedition led by René-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle constructed Fort Prudhomme on the Chickasaw Bluffs in West Tennessee.[38] By the late 17th century, French traders began to explore the Cumberland River valley, and in 1714, under Charles Charleville's command, established French Lick, a fur trading settlement at the present location of Nashville near the Cumberland River.[39][40] In 1739, the French constructed Fort Assumption under Jean-Baptiste Le Moyne de Bienville on the Mississippi River at the present location of Memphis, which they used as a base against the Chickasaw during the 1739 Campaign of the Chickasaw Wars.[41]\nIn the 1750s and 1760s, longhunters from Virginia explored much of East and Middle Tennessee.[42] Settlers from the Colony of South Carolina built Fort Loudoun on the Little Tennessee River in 1756, the first British settlement in what is now Tennessee and the westernmost British outpost to that date.[43][44] Hostilities erupted between the British and the Cherokees into an armed conflict, and a siege of the fort ended with its surrender in 1760.[45] After the French and Indian War, Britain issued the Royal Proclamation of 1763, which forbade settlements west of the Appalachian Mountains in an effort to mitigate conflicts with the Natives.[46] But migration across the mountains continued, and the first permanent European settlers began arriving in northeastern Tennessee in the late 1760s.[47][48] Most of them were English, but nearly 20% were Scotch-Irish.[49] They formed the Watauga Association in 1772, a semi-autonomous representative government,[50] and three years later reorganized themselves into the Washington District to support the cause of the American Revolutionary War.[51] The next year, after an unsuccessful petition to Virginia, North Carolina agreed to annex the Washington District to provide protection from Native American attacks.[52]\nIn 1775, Richard Henderson negotiated a series of treaties with the Cherokee to sell the lands of the Watauga settlements at Sycamore Shoals on the banks of the Watauga River. An agreement to sell land for the Transylvania Colony, which included the territory in Tennessee north of the Cumberland River, was also signed.[53] Later that year, Daniel Boone, under Henderson's employment, blazed a trail from Fort Chiswell in Virginia through the Cumberland Gap, which became part of the Wilderness Road, a major thoroughfare into Tennessee and Kentucky.[54] The Chickamauga, a Cherokee faction loyal to the British led by Dragging Canoe, opposed the settling of the Washington District and Transylvania Colony, and in 1776 attacked Fort Watauga at Sycamore Shoals.[55][56] The warnings of Dragging Canoe's cousin Nancy Ward spared many settlers' lives from the initial attacks.[57] In 1779, James Robertson and John Donelson led two groups of settlers from the Washington District to the French Lick.[58] These settlers constructed Fort Nashborough, which they named for Francis Nash, a brigadier general of the Continental Army.[59] The next year, the settlers signed the Cumberland Compact, which established a representative government for the colony called the Cumberland Association.[60] This settlement later grew into the city of Nashville.[61] That same year John Sevier led a group of Overmountain Men from Fort Watauga to the Battle of Kings Mountain in South Carolina, where they defeated the British.[62]\nThree counties of the Washington District broke off from North Carolina in 1784 and formed the State of Franklin.[63] Efforts to obtain admission to the Union failed, and the counties, now numbering eight, rejoined North Carolina by 1788.[64] North Carolina ceded the area to the federal government in 1790, after which it was organized into the Southwest Territory on May 26 of that year.[65] The act allowed the territory to petition for statehood once the population reached 60,000.[65] Administration of the territory was divided between the Washington District and the Mero District, the latter of which consisted of the Cumberland Association and was named for Spanish territorial governor Esteban Rodríguez Miró.[66] President George Washington appointed William Blount as territorial governor.[67] The Southwest Territory recorded a population of 35,691 in the first United States census that year, including 3,417 slaves.[68]\nAs support for statehood grew among the settlers, Governor Blount called for elections, which were held in December 1793.[69] The 13-member territorial House of Representatives first convened in Knoxville on February 24, 1794, to select ten members for the legislature's upper house, the Council.[69] The full legislature convened on August 25, 1794.[70] In June 1795, the legislature conducted a census of the territory, which recorded a population of 77,263, including 10,613 slaves, and a poll that showed 6,504 in favor of statehood and 2,562 opposed.[71][72] Elections for a constitutional convention were held in December 1795, and the delegates convened in Knoxville on January 17, 1796, to begin drafting a state constitution.[73] During this convention, the name Tennessee was chosen for the new state.[21] The constitution was completed on February 6, which authorized elections for the state's new legislature, the Tennessee General Assembly.[74][75] The legislature convened on March 28, 1796, and the next day, John Sevier was announced as the state's first governor.[74][75] Tennessee was admitted to the Union on June 1, 1796, as the 16th state and the first created from federal territory.[76][77]\nTennessee reportedly earned the nickname \"The Volunteer State\" during the War of 1812, when 3,500 men enthusiastically answered a recruitment call by the General Assembly for the war effort.[78] These soldiers, under Andrew Jackson's command, played a major role in the American victory at the Battle of New Orleans in 1815, the last major battle of the war.[78] Several Tennesseans took part in the Texas Revolution of 1835–36, including Governor Sam Houston and Congressman and frontiersman Davy Crockett, who was killed at the Battle of the Alamo.[79] The state's nickname was solidified during the Mexican–American War when President James K. Polk of Tennessee issued a call for 2,800 soldiers from the state, and more than 30,000 volunteered.[80]\nBetween the 1790s and 1820s, additional land cessions were negotiated with the Cherokee, who had established a national government modeled on the U.S. Constitution.[81][82] In 1818, Jackson and Kentucky governor Isaac Shelby reached an agreement with the Chickasaw to sell the land between the Mississippi and Tennessee Rivers to the United States, which included all of West Tennessee and became known as the \"Jackson Purchase\".[83] The Cherokee moved their capital from Georgia to the Red Clay Council Grounds in southeastern Tennessee in 1832, due to new laws forcing them from their previous capital at New Echota.[84] In 1838 and 1839, U.S. troops forcibly removed thousands of Cherokees and their Black slaves from their homes in southeastern Tennessee and forced them to march to Indian Territory in modern-day Oklahoma. This event is known as the Trail of Tears, and an estimated 4,000 died along the way.[85][86]\nAs settlers pushed west of the Cumberland Plateau, a slavery-based agrarian economy took hold in these regions.[87] Cotton planters used extensive slave labor on large plantation complexes in West Tennessee's fertile and flat terrain after the Jackson Purchase.[88] Cotton also took hold in the Nashville Basin during this time.[88] Entrepreneurs such as Montgomery Bell used slaves in the production of iron in the Western Highland Rim, and slaves also cultivated such crops as tobacco and corn throughout the Highland Rim.[87] East Tennessee's geography did not allow for large plantations as in the middle and western parts of the state, and as a result, slavery became increasingly rare in the region.[89] A strong abolition movement developed in East Tennessee, beginning as early as 1797, and in 1819, Elihu Embree of Jonesborough began publishing the Manumission Intelligencier (later The Emancipator), the nation's first exclusively anti-slavery newspaper.[90][91]\nAt the onset of the American Civil War, most Middle and West Tennesseans favored secession in order to preserve their slavery-based economies, while in East Tennessee, most favored remaining in the Union.[92] In 1860, slaves composed about 25% of Tennessee's population, the lowest share among the states that joined the Confederacy.[93] Tennessee provided more Union troops than any other Confederate state, and the second-highest number of Confederate troops, behind Virginia.[94][14] Due to its central location, Tennessee was a crucial state during the war and saw more military engagements than any state except Virginia.[95]\nAfter Abraham Lincoln was elected president in 1860, secessionists in the state government led by Governor Isham Harris sought voter approval to sever ties with the United States, which was rejected in a referendum by a 54–46% margin in February 1861.[96] After the Confederate attack on Fort Sumter in April and Lincoln's call for troops in response, the legislature ratified an agreement to enter a military league with the Confederacy on May 7, 1861.[97] On June 8, with Middle Tennesseans having significantly changed their position, voters approved a second referendum on secession by a 69–31% margin, becoming the last state to secede.[98] In response, East Tennessee Unionists organized a convention in Knoxville with the goal of splitting the region to form a new state loyal to the Union.[99] In the fall of 1861, Unionist guerrillas in East Tennessee burned bridges and attacked Confederate sympathizers, leading the Confederacy to invoke martial law in parts of the region.[100] In March 1862, Lincoln appointed native Tennessean and War Democrat Andrew Johnson as military governor of the state.[101]\nGeneral Ulysses S. Grant and the U.S. Navy captured the Tennessee and Cumberland rivers in February 1862 at the battles of Fort Henry and Fort Donelson.[102] Grant then proceeded south to Pittsburg Landing and held off a Confederate counterattack at Shiloh in April in what was at the time the bloodiest battle of the war.[103] Memphis fell to the Union in June after a naval battle on the Mississippi River.[104] Union strength in Middle Tennessee was tested in a series of Confederate offensives beginning in the summer of 1862, which culminated in General William Rosecrans's Army of the Cumberland routing General Braxton Bragg's Army of Tennessee at Stones River, another one of the war's costliest engagements.[105] The next summer, Rosecrans's Tullahoma campaign forced Bragg's remaining troops in Middle Tennessee to retreat to Chattanooga with little fighting.[106]\nDuring the Chattanooga campaign, Confederates attempted to besiege the Army of the Cumberland into surrendering, but reinforcements from the Army of the Tennessee under the command of Grant, William Tecumseh Sherman, and Joseph Hooker arrived.[107] The Confederates were driven from the city at the battles of Lookout Mountain and Missionary Ridge in November 1863.[108] Despite Unionist sentiment in East Tennessee, Confederates held the area for most of the war. A few days after the fall of Chattanooga, Confederates led by James Longstreet unsuccessfully campaigned to take control of Knoxville by attacking Union General Ambrose Burnside's Fort Sanders.[109] The capture of Chattanooga allowed Sherman to launch the Atlanta campaign from the city in May 1864.[110] The last major battles in the state came when Army of Tennessee regiments under John Bell Hood invaded Middle Tennessee in the fall of 1864 in an effort to draw Sherman back. They were checked by John Schofield at Franklin in November and completely dispersed by George Thomas at Nashville in December.[111] On April 27, 1865, the worst maritime disaster in American history occurred when the Sultana steamboat, which was transporting freed Union prisoners, exploded in the Mississippi River north of Memphis, killing 1,168 people.[112]\nWhen the Emancipation Proclamation was announced, Tennessee was largely held by Union forces and thus not among the states enumerated in the proclamation, so it freed no slaves in the state.[113] Andrew Johnson declared all slaves in Tennessee free on October 24, 1864.[113] On February 22, 1865, the legislature approved an amendment to the state constitution prohibiting slavery, which was approved by voters the following month, making Tennessee the only Southern state to abolish slavery.[114][115] Tennessee ratified the Thirteenth Amendment, which outlawed slavery in every state, on April 7, 1865,[116] and the Fourteenth Amendment, which granted citizenship and equal protection under the law to former slaves, on July 18, 1866.[117] Johnson became vice president when Lincoln was reelected, and president after Lincoln's assassination in May 1865.[101] On July 24, 1866, Tennessee became the first Confederate state to have its elected members readmitted to Congress.[118]\nThe years after the Civil War were characterized by tension and unrest between Blacks and former Confederates, the worst of which occurred in Memphis in 1866.[119] Because Tennessee had ratified the Fourteenth Amendment before its readmission to the Union, it was the only former secessionist state that did not have a military governor during Reconstruction.[117] The Radical Republicans seized control of the state government toward the end of the war, and appointed William G. \"Parson\" Brownlow governor. Under Brownlow's administration from 1865 to 1869, the legislature allowed African American men to vote, disenfranchised former Confederates, and took action against the Ku Klux Klan, which was founded in December 1865 in Pulaski as a vigilante group to advance former Confederates' interests.[120] In 1870, Southern Democrats regained control of the state legislature,[121] and over the next two decades, passed Jim Crow laws to enforce racial segregation.[122]\nA number of epidemics swept through Tennessee in the years after the Civil War, including cholera in 1873, which devastated the Nashville area,[123] and yellow fever in 1878, which killed more than one-tenth of Memphis's residents.[124][125] Reformers worked to modernize Tennessee into a \"New South\" economy during this time. With the help of Northern investors, Chattanooga became one of the first industrialized cities in the South.[126] Memphis became known as the \"Cotton Capital of the World\" during the late 19th century, and Nashville, Knoxville, and several smaller cities saw modest industrialization.[126] Northerners also began exploiting the coalfields and mineral resources in the Appalachian Mountains. To pay off debts and alleviate overcrowded prisons, the state turned to convict leasing, providing prisoners to mining companies as strikebreakers, which was protested by miners forced to compete with the system.[127] An armed uprising in the Cumberland Mountains known as the Coal Creek War in 1891 and 1892 resulted in the state ending convict leasing.[128][129]\nDespite New South promoters' efforts, agriculture continued to dominate Tennessee's economy.[130] The majority of freed slaves were forced into sharecropping during the latter 19th century, and many others worked as agricultural wage laborers.[131] In 1897, Tennessee celebrated its statehood centennial one year late with the Tennessee Centennial and International Exposition in Nashville.[132] A full-scale replica of the Parthenon in Athens was designed by architect William Crawford Smith and constructed for the celebration, owing to the city's reputation as the \"Athens of the South.\"[133][134]\nDue to increasing racial segregation and poor standards of living, many Black Tennesseans fled to industrial cities in the Northeast and Midwest as part of the first wave of the Great Migration between 1915 and 1930.[135] Many residents of rural parts of Tennessee relocated to larger cities during this time for more lucrative employment opportunities.[126] As part of the Temperance movement, Tennessee became the first state in the nation to effectively ban the sale, transportation, and production of alcohol in a series of laws passed between 1907 and 1917.[136] During Prohibition, illicit production of moonshine became extremely common in East Tennessee, particularly in the mountains, and continued for many decades afterward.[137]\nSgt. Alvin C. York of Fentress County became one of the most famous and honored American soldiers of World War I. He received the Congressional Medal of Honor for single-handedly capturing an entire German machine gun regiment during the Meuse–Argonne offensive.[138] On July 9, 1918, Tennessee suffered the worst rail accident in U.S. history when two passenger trains collided head on in Nashville, killing 101 and injuring 171.[139] On August 18, 1920, Tennessee became the 36th and final state necessary to ratify the Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which gave women the right to vote.[140] In 1925, John T. Scopes, a high school teacher in Dayton, was tried and convicted for teaching evolution in violation of the state's recently passed Butler Act.[141] Scopes was prosecuted by former Secretary of State and presidential candidate William Jennings Bryan and defended by attorney Clarence Darrow. The case was intentionally publicized,[142] and highlighted the creationism-evolution controversy among religious groups.[143] In 1926, Congress authorized the establishment of a national park in the Great Smoky Mountains, which was officially established in 1934 and dedicated in 1940.[144]\nWhen the Great Depression struck in 1929, much of Tennessee was severely impoverished even by national standards.[145] As part of President Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal, the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) was created in 1933 to provide electricity, jobs, flood control, improved waterway navigation, agricultural development, and economic modernization to the Tennessee River Valley.[146] The TVA built several hydroelectric dams in the state in the 1930s and 1940s, which inundated communities and thousands of farmland acreage, and forcibly displaced families via eminent domain.[147][148] The agency quickly grew into the country's largest electric utility and initiated a period of dramatic economic growth and transformation that brought many new industries and employment opportunities to the state.[149][146]\nDuring World War II, East Tennessee was chosen for the production of weapons-grade fissile enriched uranium as part of the Manhattan Project, a research and development undertaking led by the U.S. to produce the world's first atomic bombs. The planned community of Oak Ridge was built to provide accommodations for the facilities and workers; the site was chosen due to the abundance of TVA electric power, its low population density, and its inland geography and topography, which allowed for the natural separation of the facilities and a low vulnerability to attack.[150][151] The Clinton Engineer Works was established as the production arm of the Manhattan Project in Oak Ridge, which enriched uranium at three major facilities for use in atomic bombs. The first of the bombs was detonated in Los Alamos, New Mexico, in a test code-named Trinity, and the second, nicknamed \"Little Boy\", was dropped on Imperial Japan at the end of World War II.[152] After the war, the Oak Ridge National Laboratory became an institution for scientific and technological research.[153]\nAfter the U.S. Supreme Court ruled racial segregation in public schools unconstitutional in Brown v. Board of Education in 1954, Oak Ridge High School in 1955 became the first school in Tennessee to be integrated.[154] The next year, nearby Clinton High School was integrated, and Tennessee National Guard troops were sent in after pro-segregationists threatened violence.[154] Between February and May 1960, a series of sit-ins at segregated lunch counters in Nashville organized by the Nashville Student Movement resulted in the desegregation of facilities in the city.[155] On April 4, 1968, James Earl Ray assassinated civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. in Memphis.[156] King had traveled there to support striking African American sanitation workers.[157][158]\nThe 1962 U.S. Supreme Court case Baker v. Carr arose out of a challenge to the longstanding rural bias of apportionment of seats in the Tennessee legislature and established the principle of \"one man, one vote\".[159][160] The construction of Interstate 40 through Memphis became a national talking point on the issue of eminent domain and grassroots lobbying when the Tennessee Department of Transportation (TDOT) attempted to construct the highway through the city's Overton Park. A local activist group spent many years contesting the project, and in 1971, the U.S. Supreme Court sided with the group and established the framework for judicial review of government agencies in the landmark case of Citizens to Preserve Overton Park v. Volpe.[161][162] TVA's construction of the Tellico Dam in Loudon County became the subject of national controversy in the 1970s when the endangered snail darter fish was reported to be affected by the project. After lawsuits by environmental groups, the debate was decided by the U.S. Supreme Court case Tennessee Valley Authority v. Hill in 1978, leading to amendments of the Endangered Species Act.[163]\nThe 1982 World's Fair was held in Knoxville.[164] Also known as the Knoxville International Energy Exposition, the fair's theme was \"Energy Turns the World\". The exposition was one of the most successful, and the most recent world's fair to be held in the U.S.[165] In 1986, Tennessee held a yearlong celebration of the state's heritage and culture called \"Homecoming '86\".[166][167] Tennessee celebrated its bicentennial in 1996 with a yearlong celebration called \"Tennessee 200\". A new state park that traces the state's history, Bicentennial Mall, was opened at the foot of Capitol Hill in Nashville.[168] The same year, the whitewater slalom events at the Atlanta Summer Olympic Games were held on the Ocoee River in Polk County.[169]\nIn 2002, Tennessee amended its constitution to establish a lottery.[170] In 2006, the state constitution was amended to outlaw same-sex marriage. This amendment was invalidated by the 2015 U.S. Supreme Court case Obergefell v. Hodges.[171] On December 23, 2008, the largest industrial waste spill in United States history occurred at TVA's Kingston Fossil Plant when more than 1.1 billion gallons of coal ash slurry was accidentally released into the Emory and Clinch Rivers.[172][173] The cleanup cost more than $1 billion and lasted until 2015.[174]\nTennessee is in the Southeastern United States. Culturally, most of the state is considered part of the Upland South, and the eastern third is part of Appalachia.[175] Tennessee covers roughly 42,143 square miles (109,150 km2), of which 926 square miles (2,400 km2), or 2.2%, is water. It is the 16th smallest state in land area. The state is about 440 miles (710 km) long from east to west and 112 miles (180 km) wide from north to south. Tennessee is geographically, culturally, economically, and legally divided into three Grand Divisions: East Tennessee, Middle Tennessee, and West Tennessee.[176] It borders eight other states: Kentucky and Virginia to the north, North Carolina to the east, Georgia, Alabama, and Mississippi on the south, and Arkansas and Missouri on the west. It is tied with Missouri as the state bordering the most other states.[177] Tennessee is trisected by the Tennessee River, and its geographical center is in Murfreesboro. The boundaries between both Eastern and Central Time and East and Middle Tennessee traverse the Cumberland Plateau.[178] The Tennessee River forms most of the division between Middle and West Tennessee.[176]\nTennessee's eastern boundary roughly follows the highest crests of the Blue Ridge Mountains, and the Mississippi River forms its western boundary.[179] Due to flooding of the Mississippi that has changed its path, the state's western boundary deviates from the river in some places.[180] The northern border was originally defined as 36°30′ north latitude and the Royal Colonial Boundary of 1665, but due to faulty surveys, begins north of this line in the east, and to the west, gradually veers north before shifting south onto the actual 36°30′ parallel at the Tennessee River in West Tennessee.[179][181] Uncertainties in the latter 19th century over the location of the state's border with Virginia culminated in the U.S. Supreme Court settling the matter in 1893, which resulted in the division of Bristol between the two states.[182] An 1818 survey erroneously placed Tennessee's southern border 1 mile (1.6 km) south of the 35th parallel; Georgia legislators continue to dispute this placement, as it prevents Georgia from accessing the Tennessee River.[183]\nMarked by a diversity of landforms and topographies, Tennessee features six principal physiographic provinces, from east to west, which are part of three larger regions: The Blue Ridge Mountains, Ridge-and-Valley Appalachians, and Cumberland Plateau, part of the Appalachian Mountains; the Highland Rim and Nashville Basin, part of the Interior Low Plateaus of the Interior Plains; and the East Gulf Coastal Plain, part of the Atlantic Plains.[184][185] Other regions include the southern tip of the Cumberland Mountains, the Western Tennessee Valley, and the Mississippi Alluvial Plain. The state's highest point, which is also the third-highest peak in eastern North America, is Clingmans Dome, at 6,643 feet (2,025 m) above sea level.[186] The state's lowest point, 178 feet (54 m), is on the Mississippi River at the Mississippi state line in Memphis.[3] Tennessee has the most caves in the United States, with more than 10,000 documented.[187]\nGeological formations in Tennessee largely correspond with the state's topographic features, and, in general, decrease in age from east to west. The state's oldest rocks are igneous strata more than 1 billion years old found in the Blue Ridge Mountains,[188][189] and the youngest deposits in Tennessee are sands and silts in the Mississippi Alluvial Plain and river valleys that drain into the Mississippi River.[190] Tennessee is considered seismically active and contains two major seismic zones, although destructive earthquakes rarely occur there.[191][192] The Eastern Tennessee Seismic Zone spans the entirety of East Tennessee from northwestern Alabama to southwestern Virginia, and is considered one of the most seismically active zones in the Southeastern United States, frequently producing low-magnitude earthquakes.[193] The New Madrid Seismic Zone in the northwestern part of the state produced a series of devastating earthquakes between December 1811 and February 1812 that formed Reelfoot Lake near Tiptonville.[194]\nThe southwestern Blue Ridge Mountains lie within Tennessee's eastern edge, and are divided into several subranges, namely the Great Smoky Mountains, Bald Mountains, Unicoi Mountains, Unaka Mountains, and Iron Mountains. These mountains, which average 5,000 feet (1,500 m) above sea level in Tennessee, contain some of the highest elevations in eastern North America. The state's border with North Carolina roughly follows the highest peaks of this range, including Clingmans Dome. Most of the Blue Ridge area is protected by the Cherokee National Forest, the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, and several federal wilderness areas and state parks.[195] The Appalachian Trail roughly follows the North Carolina state line before shifting westward into Tennessee.[196]\nStretching west from the Blue Ridge Mountains for about 55 miles (89 km) are the Ridge-and-Valley Appalachians, also known as the Tennessee Valley[b] or Great Valley of East Tennessee. This area consists of linear parallel ridges separated by valleys that trend northeast to southwest, the general direction of the entire Appalachian range.[197] Most of these ridges are low, but some of the higher ones are commonly called mountains.[197] Numerous tributaries join to form the Tennessee River in the Ridge and Valley Region.[198]\nThe Cumberland Plateau rises to the west of the Tennessee Valley, with an average elevation of 2,000 feet (610 m).[199] This landform is part of the larger Appalachian Plateau and consists mostly of flat-topped tablelands.[200] The plateau's eastern edge is relatively distinct, but the western escarpment is irregular, containing several long, crooked stream valleys separated by rocky cliffs that contain numerous waterfalls.[201] The Cumberland Mountains, with peaks above 3,500 feet (1,100 m), comprise the northeastern part of the Appalachian Plateau in Tennessee, and the southeastern part of the Cumberland Plateau is divided by the Sequatchie Valley.[201] The Cumberland Trail traverses the eastern escarpment of the Cumberland Plateau and Cumberland Mountains.[202]\nWest of the Cumberland Plateau is the Highland Rim, an elevated plain that surrounds the Nashville Basin, a geological dome.[203] Both of these physiographic provinces are part of the Interior Low Plateaus of the larger Interior Plains. The Highland Rim is Tennessee's largest geographic region, and is often split into eastern and western halves.[204] The Eastern Highland Rim is characterized by relatively level plains dotted by rolling hills, and the Western Highland Rim and western Nashville Basin are covered with uneven rounded knobs with steep ravines separated by meandering streams.[205] The Nashville Basin has rich, fertile farmland,[206] and porous limestone bedrock very close to the surface underlies both the Nashville Basin and Eastern Highland Rim.[207] This results in karst that forms numerous caves, sinkholes, depressions, and underground streams.[208]\nWest of the Highland Rim is the Western Tennessee Valley, which consists of about 10 miles (16 km) in width of hilly land along the banks of the Tennessee River.[209] West of this is the Gulf Coastal Plain, a broad feature that begins at the Gulf of Mexico and extends northward into southern Illinois.[210] The plain begins in the east with low rolling hills and wide stream valleys, known as the West Tennessee Highlands, and gradually levels out to the west.[211] The plain ends at steep loess bluffs overlooking the Mississippi embayment, the westernmost physiographic division of Tennessee, part of the larger Mississippi Alluvial Plain.[212] This flat 10 to 14 miles (16 to 23 km) wide strip is commonly known as the Mississippi Bottoms, and contains lowlands, floodplains, and swamps.[213][214]\nTennessee is drained by three major rivers, the Tennessee, Cumberland, and Mississippi. The Tennessee River begins at the juncture of the Holston and French Broad rivers in Knoxville, flows southwest to Chattanooga, and exits into Alabama before reemerging in the western part of the state and flowing north into Kentucky.[215] Its major tributaries include the Clinch, Little Tennessee, Hiwassee, Sequatchie, Elk, Beech, Buffalo, Duck, and Big Sandy rivers.[215] The Cumberland River flows through the north-central part of the state, emerging in the northeastern Highland Rim, passing through Nashville, turning northwest to Clarksville, and entering Kentucky west of the Tennessee River.[216] Its principal branches in Tennessee are the Obey, Caney Fork, Stones, Harpeth, and Red rivers.[216] The Mississippi River drains nearly all of West Tennessee.[217] Its tributaries are the Obion, Forked Deer, Hatchie, Loosahatchie, and Wolf rivers.[217] The Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers operate many hydroelectric dams on the Tennessee and Cumberland rivers and their tributaries, which form large reservoirs throughout the state.[218]\nAbout half the state's land area is in the Tennessee Valley drainage basin of the Tennessee River.[215] The Cumberland River basin covers the northern half of Middle Tennessee and a small portion of East Tennessee.[216] A small part of north-central Tennessee is in the Green River watershed.[219] All three of these basins are tributaries of the Ohio River watershed. Most of West Tennessee is in the Lower Mississippi River watershed.[217] The entirety of the state is in the Mississippi River watershed, except for a small sliver near the southeastern corner traversed by the Conasauga River, which is part of the Mobile Bay watershed.[220]\nTennessee is within a temperate deciduous forest biome commonly known as the Eastern Deciduous Forest.[221] It has eight ecoregions: the Blue Ridge, Ridge and Valley, Central Appalachian, Southwestern Appalachian, Interior Low Plateaus, Southeastern Plains, Mississippi Valley Loess Plains, and Mississippi Alluvial Plain regions.[222] Due to its wide variety of terrains and ecosystems, Tennessee is the most biodiverse inland state.[223] The Great Smoky Mountains National Park is the most biodiverse national park,[224][225] and the state's Duck River is the most biologically diverse waterway in North America.[226] The Nashville Basin is also renowned for its diversity of flora and fauna.[227] Tennessee is home to 340 species of birds, 325 freshwater fish species, 89 mammals, 77 amphibians, and 61 reptiles.[224]\nForests cover about 52% of Tennessee's land area, with oak–hickory the dominant type.[228] Appalachian oak–pine and cove hardwood forests are found in the Blue Ridge Mountains and Cumberland Plateau, and bottomland hardwood forests are common throughout the Gulf Coastal Plain.[229] Pine forests are also found throughout the state.[229] The Southern Appalachian spruce–fir forest in the highest elevations of the Blue Ridge Mountains is considered the second-most endangered ecosystem in the country.[230] Some of the last remaining large American chestnut trees grow in the Nashville Basin, and are being used to help breed blight-resistant trees.[231] Middle Tennessee is home to many unusual and rare ecosystems known as cedar glades, which occur in areas with shallow limestone bedrock that is largely barren of overlying soil, and contain many endemic plant species.[232]\nCommon mammals found throughout Tennessee include white-tailed deer, red and gray foxes, coyotes, raccoons, opossums, wild turkeys, rabbits, and squirrels. Black bears are found in the Blue Ridge Mountains and on the Cumberland Plateau. Tennessee has the third-highest number of amphibian species, with the Great Smoky Mountains home to the most salamander species in the world.[233] The state also ranks second in the nation for the diversity of its freshwater fish species.[234]\nMost of Tennessee has a humid subtropical climate, with the exception of some of the higher elevations in the Appalachians, which are classified as a cooler mountain temperate or humid continental climate.[235] The Gulf of Mexico is the dominant factor in Tennessee's climate, with winds from the south responsible for most of the state's annual precipitation. Generally, the state has hot summers and mild to cool winters with generous precipitation throughout the year. The highest average monthly precipitation usually occurs between December and April. The driest months, on average, are August to October. The state receives an average of 50 inches (130 cm) of precipitation annually. Snowfall ranges from 5 inches (13 cm) in West Tennessee to over 80 inches (200 cm) in East Tennessee's highest mountains.[236][237]\nSummers are generally hot and humid, with most of the state averaging a high of around 90 °F (32 °C). Winters tend to be mild to cool, decreasing in temperature at higher elevations. For areas outside the highest mountains, the average overnight lows are generally near freezing. The highest recorded temperature was 113 °F (45 °C) at Perryville on August 9, 1930, while the lowest recorded temperature was −32 °F (−36 °C) at Mountain City on December 30, 1917.[238]\nWhile Tennessee is far enough from the coast to avoid any direct impact from a hurricane, its location makes it susceptible to the remnants of tropical cyclones, which weaken over land and can cause significant rainfall.[239] The state annually averages about 50 days of thunderstorms, which can be severe with large hail and damaging winds.[240] Tornadoes are possible throughout the state, with West and Middle Tennessee the most vulnerable. The state averages 15 tornadoes annually.[241] They can be severe, and the state leads the nation in the percentage of total tornadoes that have fatalities.[242] Winter storms such as the Blizzard of 1993 are an occasional problem, although ice storms are more common. Fog is a persistent problem in some areas, especially East Tennessee.[243]\nTennessee is divided into 95 counties, each of which has a county seat.[245] The state has 340 municipalities in total.[246] The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) designates ten metropolitan areas in Tennessee, four of which extend into neighboring states.[247]\nNashville is Tennessee's capital and largest city, with nearly 700,000 residents.[248] Its 13-county metropolitan area has been the state's largest since the early 1990s, and is one of the nation's fastest-growing metropolitan areas, with about 2 million residents.[249] Memphis, with more than 630,000 inhabitants, was the state's largest city until 2016, when Nashville surpassed it.[2] It is in Shelby County, Tennessee's largest county in both population and land area.[250] Knoxville, with about 190,000 inhabitants, and Chattanooga, with about 180,000 residents, are the third- and fourth-largest cities, respectively.[248] Clarksville is a significant population center, with about 170,000 residents.[248] Murfreesboro is the sixth-largest city and Nashville's largest suburb, with more than 150,000 residents.[248] In addition to the major cities, the Tri-Cities of Kingsport, Bristol, and Johnson City are considered the sixth major population center.[251]\nThe 2020 United States census reported Tennessee's population at 6,910,840, an increase of 564,735, or 8.90%, since the 2010 census.[4] Between 2010 and 2019, the state received a natural increase of 143,253 (744,274 births minus 601,021 deaths), and an increase from net migration of 338,428 people into the state. Immigration from outside the U.S. resulted in a net increase of 79,086, and migration within the country produced a net increase of 259,342.[253] Tennessee's center of population is in Murfreesboro in Rutherford County.[254]\nAccording to the 2010 census, 6.4% of Tennessee's population were under age 5, 23.6% were under 18, and 13.4% were 65 or older.[255] In recent years, Tennessee has been a top source of domestic migration, receiving an influx of people relocating from places such as California, the Northeast, and the Midwest due to the low cost of living and booming employment opportunities.[256][257] In 2019, about 5.5% of Tennessee's population was foreign-born. Of the foreign-born population, approximately 42.7% were naturalized citizens and 57.3% non-citizens.[258] The foreign-born population consisted of approximately 49.9% from Latin America, 27.1% from Asia, 11.9% from Europe, 7.7% from Africa, 2.7% from Northern America, and 0.6% from Oceania.[259]\nWith the exception of a slump in the 1980s, Tennessee has been one of the fastest-growing states in the nation since 1970, benefiting from the larger Sun Belt phenomenon.[260] The state has been a top destination for people relocating from Northeastern and Midwestern states. This time period has seen the birth of new economic sectors in the state and has positioned the Nashville and Clarksville metropolitan areas as two of the fastest-growing regions in the country.[261]\nIn 2020, 6.9% of the total population was of Hispanic or Latino origin (of any race), up from 4.6% in 2010. Between 2000 and 2010, Tennessee's Hispanic population grew by 134.2%, the third-highest rate of any state.[265] In 2020, Non-Hispanic or Latino Whites were 70.9% of the population, compared to 57.7% of the population nationwide.[266] In 2010, the five most common self-reported ethnic groups in the state were American (26.5%), English (8.2%), Irish (6.6%), German (5.5%), and Scotch-Irish (2.7%).[267] Most Tennesseans who self-identify as having American ancestry are of English and Scotch-Irish ancestry. An estimated 21–24% of Tennesseans are of predominantly English ancestry.[268][269]\nSince colonization, Tennessee has always been predominantly Christian. About 81% of the population identifies as Christian, with Protestants making up 73% of the population. Of the Protestants in the state, Evangelical Protestants compose 52% of the population, Mainline Protestants 13%, and Historically Black Protestants 8%. Roman Catholics make up 6%, Mormons 1%, and Orthodox Christians less than 1%.[270] The largest denominations by number of adherents are the Southern Baptist Convention, the United Methodist Church, the Roman Catholic Church, and the Churches of Christ.[271] Muslims and Jews each make up about 1% of the population, and adherents of other religions make up about 3% of the population. About 14% of Tennesseans are non-religious, with 11% identifying as \"Nothing in particular\", 3% as agnostics, and 1% as atheists.[270]\nTennessee is included in most definitions of the Bible Belt, and is ranked as one of the nation's most religious states.[272] Several Protestant denominations have their headquarters in Tennessee, including the Southern Baptist Convention and National Baptist Convention (in Nashville); the Church of God in Christ and the Cumberland Presbyterian Church (in Memphis);[273] and the Church of God and the Church of God of Prophecy (in Cleveland);[274][275] and the National Association of Free Will Baptists (in Antioch).[276] Nashville has publishing houses of several denominations.[277]\nAs of 2020, Tennessee had a gross state product of $364.5 billion.[278] In 2019, the state's per capita personal income was $29,859. The median household income was $56,071.[258] About 13.9% percent of the population was below the poverty line.[4] In 2019, the state reported a total employment of 2,724,545 and a total number of 139,760 employer establishments.[4] Tennessee is a right-to-work state, like most of its Southern neighbors.[279] Unionization has historically been low and continues to decline, as in most of the U.S.[280]\nTennessee has a reputation as a low-tax state and is usually ranked as one of the five states with the lowest tax burden on residents.[281] It is one of nine states that do not have a general income tax; the sales tax is the primary means of funding the government.[282] The Hall income tax was imposed on most dividends and interest at a rate of 6% but was completely phased out by 2021.[283] The first $1,250 of individual income and $2,500 of joint income was exempt from this tax.[284] Property taxes are the primary source of revenue for local governments.[285]\nThe state's sales and use tax rate for most items is 7%, the second-highest in the nation, along with Mississippi, Rhode Island, New Jersey, and Indiana. Food is taxed at 4%, but candy, dietary supplements, and prepared foods are taxed at 7%.[286] Local sales taxes are collected in most jurisdictions at rates varying from 1.5% to 2.75%, bringing the total sales tax between 8.5% and 9.75%. The average combined rate is about 9.5%, the nation's highest average sales tax.[287] Intangible property tax is assessed on the shares of stockholders of any loan, investment, insurance, or for-profit cemetery companies. The assessment ratio is 40% of the value times the jurisdiction's tax rate.[285] Since 2016, Tennessee has had no inheritance tax.[288]\nTennessee has the eighth-most farms in the nation, which cover more than 40% of its land area and have an average size of about 155 acres (0.63 km2).[289] Cash receipts for crops and livestock have an estimated annual value of $3.5 billion, and the agriculture sector has an estimated annual impact of $81 billion on the state's economy.[289] Beef cattle is the state's largest agricultural commodity, followed by broilers and poultry.[16] Tennessee ranks 12th in the nation for the number of cattle, with more than half of its farmland dedicated to cattle grazing.[290][289] Soybeans and corn are the state's first and second-most common crops, respectively,[16] and are most heavily grown in West and Middle Tennessee, especially the northwestern corner of the state.[291][292] Tennessee ranks seventh in the nation in cotton production, most of which is grown in the fertile soils of central West Tennessee.[293]\nThe state ranks fourth nationwide in the production of tobacco, which is predominantly grown in the Ridge-and-Valley region of East Tennessee.[294] Tennessee farmers are also known worldwide for their cultivation of tomatoes and horticultural plants.[295][296] Other important cash crops in the state include hay, wheat, eggs, and snap beans.[289][294] The Nashville Basin is a top equestrian region, due to soils that produce grass favored by horses. The Tennessee Walking Horse, first bred in the region in the late 18th century, is one of the world's most recognized horse breeds.[297] Tennessee also ranks second nationwide for mule breeding and the production of goat meat.[294] The state's timber industry is largely concentrated on the Cumberland Plateau and ranks as one of the top producers of hardwood nationwide.[298]\nUntil World War II, Tennessee, like most Southern states, remained predominantly agrarian. Chattanooga became one of the first industrial cities in the south in the decades after the Civil War, when many factories, including iron foundries, steel mills, and textile mills were constructed there.[126] But most of Tennessee's industrial growth began with the federal investments in the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) and the Manhattan Project in the 1930s and 1940s. The state's industrial and manufacturing sector continued to expand in the succeeding decades, and Tennessee is now home to more than 2,400 advanced manufacturing establishments, which produce a total of more than $29 billion worth of goods annually.[299]\nThe automotive industry is Tennessee's largest manufacturing sector and one of the nation's largest.[300] Nissan's assembly plant in Smyrna is the largest automotive assembly plant in North America.[301] Two other automakers have assembly plants in Tennessee: General Motors in Spring Hill and Volkswagen in Chattanooga.[302] Ford is constructing an assembly plant in Stanton that is expected to be operational in 2025.[303] In addition, the state contains more than 900 automotive suppliers.[304] Nissan and Mitsubishi Motors have their North American corporate headquarters in Franklin.[305][306] The state is also one of the top producers of food and drink products, its second-largest manufacturing sector.[307] A number of well-known brands originated in Tennessee, and even more are produced there.[308] Tennessee also ranks as one of the largest producers of chemicals.[307] Chemical products manufactured in Tennessee include industrial chemicals, paints, pharmaceuticals, plastic resins, and soaps and hygiene products. Additional important products manufactured in Tennessee include fabricated metal products, electrical equipment, consumer electronics and electrical appliances, and nonelectrical machinery.[308]\nTennessee's commercial sector is dominated by a wide variety of companies, but its largest service industries include health care, transportation, music and entertainment, banking, and finance. Large corporations with headquarters in Tennessee include FedEx, AutoZone, International Paper, and First Horizon Corporation, all based in Memphis; Pilot Corporation and Regal Entertainment Group in Knoxville; Hospital Corporation of America and Caterpillar Inc., based in Nashville; Unum in Chattanooga; Acadia Senior Living and Community Health Systems in Franklin; Dollar General in Goodlettsville, and LifePoint Health, Tractor Supply Company, and Delek US in Brentwood.[309][310]\nSince the 1990s, the geographical area between Oak Ridge and Knoxville has been known as the Tennessee Technology Corridor, with more than 500 high-tech firms in the region.[311] The research and development industry in Tennessee is also one of the largest employment sectors, mainly due to the prominence of Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) and the Y-12 National Security Complex in the city of Oak Ridge. ORNL conducts scientific research in materials science, nuclear physics, energy, high-performance computing, systems biology, and national security, and is the largest national laboratory in the Department of Energy (DOE) system by size.[312][153] The technology sector is also a rapidly growing industry in Middle Tennessee, particularly in the Nashville metropolitan area.[313]\nTennessee's electric utilities are regulated monopolies, as in many other states.[314][315] The Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) owns over 90% of the state's generating capacity.[316] Nuclear power is Tennessee's largest source of electricity generation, producing about 47.3% of its power in 2020. The same year, 20.2% of the power was produced from natural gas, 18.4% from coal, 13.4% from hydroelectricity, and 1.6% from other renewables. About 61.3% of the electricity generated in Tennessee produces no greenhouse gas emissions.[317] Tennessee is home to the two newest civilian nuclear power reactors in the U.S., at the Watts Bar Nuclear Plant in Rhea County.[318] Tennessee was also an early leader in hydroelectric power,[319] and today is the third-largest hydroelectric power-producing state east of the Rocky Mountains.[320] Tennessee is a net consumer of electricity, receiving power from other TVA facilities in neighboring states.[321]\nTennessee has very little petroleum and natural gas reserves, but is home to one oil refinery, in Memphis.[320] Bituminous coal is mined in small quantities in the Cumberland Plateau and Cumberland Mountains.[322] There are sizable reserves of lignite coal in West Tennessee that remain untapped.[322] Coal production in Tennessee peaked in 1972, and today less than 0.1% of coal in the U.S. comes from Tennessee.[320] Tennessee is the nation's leading producer of ball clay.[322] Other major mineral products produced in Tennessee include sand, gravel, crushed stone, Portland cement, marble, sandstone, common clay, lime, and zinc.[322][323] The Copper Basin, in Tennessee's southeastern corner in Polk County, was one of the nation's most productive copper mining districts between the 1840s and 1980s, and supplied about 90% of the copper the Confederacy used during the Civil War.[324][325][326] Mining activities in the basin resulted in a major environmental disaster, which left the surrounding landscape barren for more than a century.[327] Iron ore was another major mineral mined in Tennessee until the early 20th century.[328] Tennessee was also a top producer of phosphate until the early 1990s.[329]\nTennessee is the 11th-most visited state in the nation,[331] receiving a record of 126 million tourists in 2019.[332][333][334] Its top tourist attraction is the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, the most visited national park in the U.S., with more than 12 million visitors annually.[330] The park anchors a large tourism industry based primarily in nearby Gatlinburg and Pigeon Forge, which includes Dollywood, the most visited ticketed attraction in Tennessee.[335] Attractions related to Tennessee's musical heritage are spread throughout the state.[336][337] Other top attractions include the Tennessee State Museum and Parthenon in Nashville; the National Civil Rights Museum in Memphis; Lookout Mountain, the Chattanooga Choo-Choo Hotel, Ruby Falls, and the Tennessee Aquarium in Chattanooga; the American Museum of Science and Energy in Oak Ridge, the Bristol Motor Speedway, Jack Daniel's Distillery in Lynchburg, and the Hiwassee and Ocoee rivers in Polk County.[335]\nThe National Park Service preserves four Civil War battlefields in Tennessee: Chickamauga and Chattanooga National Military Park, Stones River National Battlefield, Shiloh National Military Park, and Fort Donelson National Battlefield.[338] The NPS also operates Big South Fork National River and Recreation Area, Cumberland Gap National Historical Park, Overmountain Victory National Historic Trail, Trail of Tears National Historic Trail, and the Manhattan Project National Historical Park.[339] Tennessee is home to eight National Scenic Byways, including the Natchez Trace Parkway, the East Tennessee Crossing Byway, the Great River Road, the Norris Freeway, Cumberland National Scenic Byway, Sequatchie Valley Scenic Byway, The Trace, and the Cherohala Skyway.[340][341] Tennessee maintains 45 state parks, covering 132,000 acres (530 km2).[342] Many reservoirs created by TVA dams have also generated water-based tourist attractions.[343]\nA culturally diverse state, Tennessee blends Appalachian and Southern flavors, which originate from its English, Scotch-Irish, and African roots, and has evolved as it has grown. Its Grand Divisions also manifest into distinct cultural regions, with East Tennessee commonly associated with Southern Appalachia,[344] and Middle and West Tennessee commonly associated with Upland Southern culture.[345] Parts of West Tennessee, especially Memphis, are sometimes considered part of the Deep South.[346] The Tennessee State Museum in Nashville chronicles the state's history and culture.[347]\nTennessee is perhaps best known culturally for its musical heritage and contributions to the development of many forms of popular music.[348][349] Notable authors with ties to Tennessee include Cormac McCarthy, Peter Taylor, James Agee, Francis Hodgson Burnett, Thomas S. Stribling, Ida B. Wells, Nikki Giovanni, Shelby Foote, Ann Patchett, Ishmael Reed, and Randall Jarrell. The state's well-known contributions to Southern cuisine include Memphis-style barbecue, Nashville hot chicken, and Tennessee whiskey.[350]\nTennessee has played a critical role in the development of many forms of American popular music, including blues, country, rock and roll, rockabilly, soul, bluegrass, Contemporary Christian, and gospel. Many consider Memphis's Beale Street the epicenter of the blues, with musicians such as W. C. Handy performing in its clubs as early as 1909.[348] Memphis was historically home to Sun Records, where musicians such as Elvis Presley, Johnny Cash, Carl Perkins, Jerry Lee Lewis, Roy Orbison, and Charlie Rich began their recording careers, and where rock and roll took shape in the 1950s.[348] Stax Records in Memphis became one of the most important labels for soul artists in the late 1950s and 1960s, and a subgenre known as Memphis soul emerged.[351] The 1927 Victor recording sessions in Bristol generally mark the beginning of the country music genre and the rise of the Grand Ole Opry in the 1930s helped make Nashville the center of the country music recording industry.[352][353] Nashville became known as \"Music City\", and the Grand Ole Opry remains the nation's longest-running radio show.[349]\nMany museums and historic sites recognize Tennessee's role in nurturing various forms of popular music, including Sun Studio, Memphis Rock N' Soul Museum, Stax Museum of American Soul Music, and Blues Hall of Fame in Memphis, the Ryman Auditorium, Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum, Musicians Hall of Fame and Museum, National Museum of African American Music, and Music Row in Nashville, the International Rock-A-Billy Museum in Jackson, the Mountain Music Museum in Kingsport, and the Birthplace of Country Music Museum in Bristol.[354] The Rockabilly Hall of Fame, an online site recognizing the development of rockabilly, is also based in Nashville. Several annual music festivals take place throughout the state, the largest of which are the Beale Street Music Festival in Memphis, the CMA Music Festival in Nashville, Bonnaroo in Manchester, and Riverbend in Chattanooga.[355]\nEducation in Tennessee is administered by the Tennessee Department of Education.[356] The state Board of Education has 11 members: one from each Congressional district, a student member, and the executive director of the Tennessee Higher Education Commission (THEC), who serves as ex-officio nonvoting member.[357] Public primary and secondary education systems are operated by county, city, or special school districts to provide education at the local level, and operate under the direction of the Tennessee Department of Education.[356] The state also has many private schools.[358]\nThe state enrolls approximately 1 million K–12 students in 137 districts.[359] In 2020, the four-year high school graduation rate was 89.6%, a decrease of 0.1% from the previous year.[360] According to the most recent data, Tennessee spends $9,544 per student, the 8th lowest in the nation.[361]\nPublic higher education is overseen by the Tennessee Higher Education Commission (THEC), which provides guidance to the state's two public university systems. The University of Tennessee system operates four primary campuses in Knoxville, Chattanooga, Martin, and Pulaski; a Health Sciences Center in Memphis; and an aerospace research facility in Tullahoma.[362] The Tennessee Board of Regents (TBR), also known as The College System of Tennessee, operates 13 community colleges and 27 campuses of the Tennessee Colleges of Applied Technology (TCAT).[363] Until 2017, the TBR also operated six public universities in the state; it now only gives them administrative support.[364]\nIn 2014, the Tennessee General Assembly created the Tennessee Promise, which allows in-state high school graduates to enroll in two-year post-secondary education programs such as associate degrees and certificates at community colleges and trade schools in Tennessee tuition-free, funded by the state lottery, if they meet certain requirements.[365] The Tennessee Promise was created as part of then-governor Bill Haslam's \"Drive to 55\" program, which set a goal of increasing the number of college-educated residents to at least 55% of the state's population.[365] The program has also received national attention, with multiple states having since created similar programs modeled on the Tennessee Promise.[366]\nTennessee has 107 private institutions.[367] Vanderbilt University in Nashville is consistently ranked as one of the nation's leading research institutions.[368] Nashville is often called the \"Athens of the South\" due to its many colleges and universities.[369] Tennessee is also home to six historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs).[370]\nTennessee is home to more than 120 newspapers. The most-circulated paid newspapers in the state include The Tennessean in Nashville, The Commercial Appeal in Memphis, the Knoxville News Sentinel, the Chattanooga Times Free Press, and The Leaf-Chronicle in Clarksville, The Jackson Sun, and The Daily News Journal in Murfreesboro. All of these except the Times Free Press are owned by Gannett.[371]\nSix television media markets—Nashville, Memphis, Knoxville, Chattanooga, Tri-Cities, and Jackson—are based in Tennessee. The Nashville market is the third-largest in the Upland South and the ninth-largest in the southeastern United States, according to Nielsen Media Research. Small sections of the Huntsville, Alabama and Paducah, Kentucky-Cape Girardeau, Missouri-Harrisburg, Illinois markets also extend into the state.[372] Tennessee has 43 full-power and 41 low-power television stations[373] and more than 450 Federal Communications Commission (FCC)-licensed radio stations.[374] The Grand Ole Opry, based in Nashville, is the longest-running radio show in the country, having broadcast continuously since 1925.[349]\nThe Tennessee Department of Transportation (TDOT) is the primary agency that is tasked with regulating and maintaining Tennessee's transportation infrastructure.[375] Tennessee is currently one of five states with no transportation-related debts.[376][377]\nTennessee has 96,167 miles (154,766 km) of roads, of which 14,109 miles (22,706 km) are maintained by the state.[378] Of the state's highways, 1,233 miles (1,984 km) are part of the Interstate Highway System. Tennessee has no tolled roads or bridges but has the sixth-highest mileage of high-occupancy vehicle (HOV) lanes, which are utilized on freeways in the congestion-prone Nashville and Memphis metropolitan areas.[379]\nInterstate 40 (I-40) is the longest Interstate Highway in Tennessee, traversing the state for 455 miles (732 km).[380] Known as \"Tennessee's Main Street\", I-40 serves the major cities of Memphis, Nashville, and Knoxville, and throughout its entire length in Tennessee, one can observe the diversity of the state's geography and landforms.[381][199] I-40's branch interstates include I-240 in Memphis; I-440 in Nashville; I-840 around Nashville; I-140 from Knoxville to Maryville; and I-640 in Knoxville. In a north–south orientation, from west to east, are interstates 55, which serves Memphis; 65, which passes through Nashville; 75, which serves Chattanooga and Knoxville; and 81, which begins east of Knoxville, and serves Bristol to the northeast. I-24 is an east–west interstate that enters the state in Clarksville, passes through Nashville, and terminates in Chattanooga. I-26, although technically an east–west interstate, begins in Kingsport and runs southwardly through Johnson City before exiting into North Carolina. I-155 is a branch route of I-55 that serves the northwestern part of the state. I-275 is a short spur route in Knoxville. I-269 runs from Millington to Collierville, serving as an outer bypass of Memphis.[382][380]\nMajor airports in Tennessee include Nashville International Airport (BNA), Memphis International Airport (MEM), McGhee Tyson Airport (TYS) outside of Knoxville, Chattanooga Metropolitan Airport (CHA), Tri-Cities Regional Airport (TRI) in Blountville, and McKellar-Sipes Regional Airport (MKL) in Jackson. Because Memphis International Airport is the hub of FedEx Corporation, it is the world's busiest cargo airport.[383] The state also has 74 general aviation airports and 148 heliports.[378]\nFor passenger rail service, Memphis and Newbern are served by the Amtrak City of New Orleans line on its run between Chicago and New Orleans.[384] Nashville is served by the Music City Star commuter rail service.[385] Tennessee currently has 2,604 miles (4,191 km) of freight trackage in operation,[386] most of which are owned by CSX Transportation.[387] Norfolk Southern Railway also operates lines in East and southwestern Tennessee.[388] BNSF operates a major intermodal facility in Memphis.\nTennessee has a total of 976 miles (1,571 km) of navigable waterways, the 11th highest in the nation.[378] These include the Mississippi, Tennessee, and Cumberland rivers.[389] Five inland ports are located in the state, including the Port of Memphis, which is the fifth-largest in the United States and the second largest on the Mississippi River.[390]\nThe Constitution of Tennessee was adopted in 1870. The state had two previous constitutions. The first was adopted in 1796, the year Tennessee was admitted to the union, and the second in 1834. Since 1826, Nashville has been the capital of Tennessee. The capital was previously in three other cities.[391] Knoxville was the capital from statehood in 1796 until 1812,[391] except for September 21, 1807, when the legislature met in Kingston for a day.[392] The capital was relocated to Nashville in 1812, where it remained until it was relocated back to Knoxville in 1817. The next year, the capital was moved to Murfreesboro, where it remained until 1826. Nashville was officially named Tennessee's permanent capital in 1843.[391]\nLike the federal government, Tennessee's government has three branches. The executive branch is led by the governor, who holds office for a four-year term and may serve a maximum of two consecutive terms.[393] The governor is the only official elected statewide. The current governor is Bill Lee, a Republican. The governor is supported by 22 cabinet-level departments, most headed by a commissioner the governor appoints. The executive branch also includes several agencies, boards, and commissions, some of which are under the auspices of one of the cabinet-level departments.[394]\nThe bicameral legislative branch, the Tennessee General Assembly, consists of the 33-member Senate and the 99-member House of Representatives.[395] Senators serve four-year terms and House members serve two-year terms.[396] Each chamber chooses a Speaker, who is elected by a joint session of the legislature.[397] The Speaker of the Senate also serves as the lieutenant governor, a practice found only in one other state, and the House Speaker is third in line for the governorship.[393] The legislature can override a veto by a simple majority, and the state has no \"pocket veto\".[393] The legislature convenes at noon on the second Tuesday in January and meets for a total of 90 days over two sessions, usually adjourning in late April or early May.[396] Special sessions may be called by the governor or by two-thirds of the members of both chambers.[398]\nTennessee's highest court is the state Supreme Court.[399] It has a chief justice and four associate justices.[399] No more than two justices can be from the same Grand Division.[399] The Supreme Court of Tennessee appoints the state's Attorney General, a practice only found in Tennessee.[400] Both the Court of Appeals and the Court of Criminal Appeals have 12 judges, who are evenly from each Grand Division.[401] Under the Tennessee Plan, the governor appoints justices on all three courts to eight-year terms; they must be retained by the voters during the first general election after appointment and at the end of their term.[402] Tennessee is divided into 31 judicial districts, each with a circuit and chancery court, and a district attorney and judges elected to eight-year terms. Separate criminal courts serve 13 of the 31 judicial districts; circuit courts handle criminal cases in the remaining districts. Local courts include general sessions, juvenile and domestic, and municipal courts.[403]\nTennessee maintains four dedicated law enforcement agencies: the Tennessee Highway Patrol (THP), the Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency (TWRA), the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation (TBI), and the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation (TDEC). The Highway Patrol is the primary entity that enforces highway safety regulations and general non-wildlife state laws. It is under the jurisdiction of the Department of Safety. The TWRA is an independent agency tasked with enforcing all wildlife, boating, and fishery regulations outside of state parks. TDEC enforces state environmental laws and regulations. The TBI is the primary state-level criminal investigative department. State park rangers are responsible for all activities and law enforcement inside the Tennessee State Parks system. Capital punishment is legal in Tennessee and has existed at various times since statehood.[404][405] Lethal injection is the primary means of execution, but electrocution is also allowed.[406][407]\nTennessee is divided into 95 counties, with 92 county governments that use a county commission legislative body and a separately elected county executive. The governments of Davidson (Nashville), Moore (Lynchburg), and Trousdale (Hartsville) are consolidated with their county seats. Each county elects a sheriff, property assessor, trustee, register of deeds, and county clerk.[408] Tennessee has more than 340 municipalities. Most cities and towns use the weak mayor-council (mayor-aldermen), strong-mayor council, city commission, or council–manager forms of government. Local law enforcement is divided between county sheriff's offices and municipal police departments. In every county except Davidson, the sheriff is the chief law enforcement officer.[409]\nTennessee sends nine representatives to the United States House of Representatives. The current delegation consists of seven Republicans and two Democrats. Its U.S. senators are Marsha Blackburn and Bill Hagerty, both Republicans. Tennessee is under the jurisdiction of the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, which has jurisdiction over three district courts in the state: the Eastern, Middle, and Western districts.[410]\nThe Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians is Tennessee's only federally recognized Native American tribe. It owns 79 acres (32 ha) in Henning, which the tribe placed into federal trust in 2012. This is governed directly by the tribe.[411]\nTennessee's politics are currently dominated by the Republican Party.[412][413] Republicans currently hold the state's U.S. Senate seats, 7 out of 9 Congressional seats, 73 out of 99 state house seats, and 27 out of 33 state senate seats. Democratic strength is largely concentrated in Nashville, Memphis, and parts of Knoxville, Chattanooga, and Clarksville. Several suburban areas of Nashville and Memphis also contain significant Democratic minorities, but these areas are still safely Republican.[413] Tennessee is one of thirteen states which holds its presidential primaries on Super Tuesday.[414] Tennessee does not require voters to declare a party affiliation when registering. The state is one of eight states which require voters to present a form of photo identification.[415]\nBetween the end of the Civil War and the mid-20th century, Tennessee was part of the Democratic Solid South but had the largest Republican minority of any former Confederate state.[416] During this time, East Tennessee was heavily Republican and the western two thirds mostly voted Democratic, with the latter dominating the state.[417] This division was related to the state's pattern of Unionist and Confederate loyalism during the Civil War.[417] Tennessee's 1st and 2nd congressional districts, based in the Tri-Cities and Knoxville, respectively, are among the few historically Republican districts in the South. The first has been in Republican hands continuously since 1881, and Republicans or their antecedents have held it for all but four years since 1859.[418] The second has been held continuously by Republicans or their antecedents since 1855.[419]\nDuring Reconstruction, freedmen and former free Blacks were granted the right to vote; most joined the Republican Party. Numerous African Americans were elected to local offices, and some to state office. Following Reconstruction, Tennessee continued to have competitive party politics, but in the 1880s, the White-dominated state government passed Jim Crow laws, one of which imposed a poll tax requirement for voter registration. These served to disenfranchise most African Americans, and their power in state and local politics was markedly reduced. After the disenfranchisement of Blacks, the Republican Party became a primarily White sectional party supported mostly in East Tennessee. In the early 1900s, the state legislature approved legislation allowing cities to adopt a commission form of government based on at-large voting as a means to limit African American political participation.[420] It was not until after the passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 that African Americans were able to regain their full voting rights.[421]\nBetween the end of Reconstruction and the mid-20th century, Tennessee voted consistently Democratic in Presidential elections, except for two nationwide Republican landslides in the 1920s. Tennesseans narrowly supported Warren G. Harding over Ohio Governor James Cox in 1920,[422] and more decisively voted for Herbert Hoover over New York Governor Al Smith in 1928.[423] For most of the second half of the 20th century, Tennessee was a swing state in presidential elections.[424] During this time, Democratic presidential nominees from Southern states, including Lyndon B. Johnson, Jimmy Carter, and Bill Clinton, tended to fare better in Tennessee than their Northern counterparts, especially among split-ticket voters outside the metropolitan areas. In the 1950s, Tennessee twice voted for Republican Dwight D. Eisenhower, former Allied Commander of the Armed Forces during World War II.[425] Howard Baker, first elected in 1966, became the first Republican U.S. Senator from Tennessee since Reconstruction.[426] The elections of Winfield Dunn as governor and Bill Brock to the U.S. Senate in 1970 further helped make the Republican Party competitive among Whites in statewide elections.[427] In the 2000 presidential election, Vice President Al Gore, who had previously served as a Democratic U.S. Senator from Tennessee, failed to carry his home state, an unusual occurrence but indicative of strengthening Republican support.[428]\nBeginning in the early 21st century, Tennessee transitioned into a solid Republican state, primarily due to rural White voters who have rejected the increasing liberalism of the Democratic Party.[429][430] In 2004, Republican President George W. Bush increased his margin of victory in the state to 14% from 4% in 2000.[431][432] In 2007, Ron Ramsey became the first Republican Speaker of the State Senate since Reconstruction,[433] and the following year the Republicans gained control of both houses of the state legislature for the first time since Reconstruction.[434] Voters, however, continued to elect moderate Republicans, such as centrists Bill Haslam and Lamar Alexander, until the late 2010s with the rise of Trumpism in the GOP at a nationwide scale.[435] Since 2016, Tennessee has been the most populous state to vote Republican by more than 60% in presidential elections,[436] and in 2020 voted Republican by the largest margin of any state by the number of votes.[437]\nTennessee is home to four major professional sports franchises:[438] the Tennessee Titans have played in the National Football League (NFL) since 1997,[439] the Nashville Predators have played in the National Hockey League (NHL) since 1998,[440] the Memphis Grizzlies have played in the National Basketball Association (NBA) since 2001,[441] and Nashville SC has played in Major League Soccer (MLS) since 2020.[442]\nThe state is also home to eight minor league teams. Four of these are Minor League Baseball clubs. The Nashville Sounds, which began play in 1978,[443] and Memphis Redbirds, which began in 1998,[444] each compete in the Triple-A East at the Triple-A level, the highest before Major League Baseball.[445] The Tennessee Smokies, which have played continuously since 1972,[446] and Chattanooga Lookouts, which have played continuously since 1976,[447] are members of the Double-A classification Double-A South.[448] Tennessee has three minor league soccer teams. Memphis 901 FC has played in the second-tier USL Championship since 2019.[449] Chattanooga Red Wolves SC has been a member of the third-tier USL League One since 2019.[450] Founded in 2009, Chattanooga FC began playing in the third-tier National Independent Soccer Association in 2020.[451] The state has one minor league ice hockey team: the Knoxville Ice Bears, which began play in 2002 and are members of the Southern Professional Hockey League.[452]\nThe state is home to 12 NCAA Division I programs. Four of these participate in the top level of college football, the Football Bowl Subdivision.[453] In Knoxville, the Tennessee Volunteers college teams play in the Southeastern Conference (SEC) of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA).[453] In Nashville, the Vanderbilt Commodores are also members of the SEC.[453] The Memphis Tigers are members of the American Athletic Conference, and Murfreesboro's Middle Tennessee Blue Raiders play in Conference USA.[453] Nashville is also home to the Belmont Bruins and Tennessee State Tigers, both members of the Ohio Valley Conference (OVC), and the Lipscomb Bisons, members of the ASUN Conference.[453] Tennessee State plays football in Division I's second level, the Football Championship Subdivision, while Belmont and Lipscomb do not have football teams.[453] The OVC also includes the Austin Peay Governors from Clarksville, the UT Martin Skyhawks from Martin, and the Tennessee Tech Golden Eagles from Cookeville. The Chattanooga Mocs and Johnson City's East Tennessee State Buccaneers are full members, including football, of the Southern Conference.[453]\nTennessee is also home to the Bristol Motor Speedway, which features NASCAR Cup Series racing two weekends a year, routinely selling out more than 160,000 seats on each date.[454] The Nashville Superspeedway in Lebanon, which previously held Nationwide and IndyCar races until it was shut down in 2011, reopened to host the NASCAR Cup Series in 2021.[455] Tennessee's only graded stakes horserace, the Iroquois Steeplechase, is held in Nashville each May.[456] The WGC Invitational is a PGA Tour golf tournament that has been held in Memphis since 1958.[457]\n36°N 86°W﻿ / ﻿36°N 86°W﻿ / 36; -86",

Ohio)\nOn August 10, 2020, the court issued an order granting partial summary judgment in favor of the plaintiffs and against the defendants in Ability Center, et al. v. Moline Builders, et al. (N.D. Ohio).  At issue was whether, under the Fair Housing Act’s accessibility requirements for newly-constructed multifamily dwellings, the front door and walkway leading to a covered unit are required to be accessible to persons with disabilities.  Defendants argued that their only obligation was to provide an accessible route into the unit, which, they alleged, they had done by providing an accessible route through the garage.  The United States filed a Statement of Interest arguing that, under the Act, the front doors and walkways are “public use and common use portions” of covered dwellings and therefore required to be accessible, regardless whether there is another accessible route into the unit.  The court agreed, finding that the failure to provide “unimpeded access” to the front door to persons who use wheelchairs, including not just those who live in the unit but also a “neighbor, friend, or family member, a political candidate, or a repairman,” is “in effect, to send them away as if unwelcome,” and “precisely the discrimination the FHAA forbids.”\nAlbanian Associated Fund, Inc. v. Township of Wayne (D. N.J.)\nAlexander v. Riga (3rd Cir.)\nAmerican Insurance Association v. HUD (D.D.C.)\nArnal v. Aspen View Condo. Ass'n, et al. (D. Colo.)\nAvalon Residential Care, Homes, Inc. v. City of Dallas (N.D. Tex.)\nBaltimore Neighborhoods, Inc. v. Rommel Builders, Inc. (D. Md.)\nBank of America Corporation\nBloch v. Frischholz (7th Cir.)\nCalvillo, et al. v. Baywood Equities, L.P., et al.\nCason v. Nissan Motor Acceptance Corporation (M.D. Tenn.)\nOn July 11, 2000, the United States filed an amicus curiae brief in support of plaintiffs in Cason v. Nissan Motor Acceptance Corporation (M.D. Tenn.). In this case, plaintiffs allege that defendants' practice of permitting Nissan dealers to set finance charges at their discretion resulted in African-Americans paying higher finance charges, and that these higher charges could not be explained by non-discriminatory factors. In our amicus brief in support of plaintiffs 'opposition to defendant's motion for summary judgment, we argue that a lender has a non-delegable duty to comply with ECOA, and, thus, is liable under ECOA for discriminatory pricing in loans that it approves and funds. The United States further argue that plaintiffs do not need to prove that defendant was on notice regarding the alleged discrimination, but that, in any case, plaintiffs have offered evidence that defendant was on notice. The court subsequently denied summary judgment for the defendants, and the case is currently on appeal regarding class certification.\nChristian Fellowship Centers of NY, Inc. v. Village of Canton, NY (N.D.N.Y.)\nOn March 26, 2019, the United States filed a Statement of Interest in Christian Fellowship Centers of New York, Inc. v. Village of Canton, NY (N.D.N.Y.), a case brought under the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act of 2000 (RLUIPA).  The case involves Christian Fellowship Centers of New York, Inc. (“CFC”), a religious organization that purchased property in the Village of Canton’s (“Village”) downtown C-1 Commercial District to assemble for worship and conduct other religious activities.  In its filed Complaint, CFC alleges that the Village barred it from operating in the C-1 district, even though the Village’s zoning law permits other similarly situated secular assembly uses to operate in the district, including municipal buildings, charitable and social clubs, and theaters.  CFC filed a motion for a preliminary injunction asking the court to find that the Village’s zoning law facially violates RLUIPA’s equal terms provision, which the Village opposed, arguing that it had legitimate zoning goals, such as promoting commercial enterprise in the C-1 district and the impact of New York’s law limiting the distance between churches and liquor-serving establishments, to bar CFC from operating in the C-1 district.  The Division argued in the Statement of Interest that CFC is likely to prevail on the merits of its RLUIPA equal term claim, and that the Village’s justifications for barring churches from the C-1 district are not valid bases under RLUIPA to treat churches less favorably than similarly situated secular assemblies.  On March 29, 2019, the United States District Court for the Northern District of New York issued an opinion granting CFC’s motion for a preliminary injunction and enjoining the Village from enforcing the ordinance to prevent CFC from using the property as a church until further proceedings are held.  The Court reasoned that CFC has a likelihood of success to prevail on the merits of its RLUIPA equal terms claim because the ordinance treats religious assemblies less well than secular assemblies and the interests articulated by the Village are not compelling to justify unequal treatment.\nCongregation Etz Chaim v. City of Los Angeles (C.D. Cal.)\nOn April 28, 2011, the United States filed a Statement of Interest in Congregation Etz Chaim v. City of Los Angeles (C.D. Cal.), in support of the Congregation's motion for summary judgment in this Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act (RLUIPA) suit. The statement of interest addresses the standard the court should apply in evaluating the Congregation's RLUIPA Section 2(b)(1) claim, and discusses certain criteria for determining whether a substantial burden exists under RLUIPA Section 2(a). On January 6, 2011, the court issued an order holding that the City's administrative zoning decisions did not preclude the congregation's RLUIPA claims in federal court. The United States had filed a statement of interest on November 1, 2010. In the order, the court quoted the United States' Statement of Interest extensively.\nConsumer Financial Protection Bureau & United States v. Hudson City Savings Bank, F.S.B. (D. N.J.)\nConsumer Financial Protection Bureau & United States v. National City Bank (W.D. Pa.)\nDefiore v. City Rescue Mission of New Castle (W.D. Pa.)\nDominos' Pizza LLC (N.C.)\nDrayton v. McIntosh County (S.D. Ga.)\nEstes. v. Rutherford County Regional Planning Commission (Chancery Court for Rutherford County, Tennessee)\nOn October 18, 2010, the United States' filed an amicus brief in Estes v. Rutherford County Regional Planning Commission (Chancery Court for Rutherford County, Tennessee). The amicus brief argues that Islam is plainly a religion, that a mosque is plainly a place of worship, and that county acted appropriately under the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act (RLUIPA) in treating the application as it would any other application from a religious institution. The division's brief argues that Islam is a religion entitled to protection under the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, and points out that, \"consistent among all three branches of government, the United States has recognized Islam as a major world religion.\" This is an action brought by county residents in state court objecting to the county's approval of a mosque construction project in Murfreesboro. The residents contend, among other things, that the county erred in treating the mosque as a religious institution without inquiring into whether Islam is an ideology rather than a religion, and without inquiring into whether terrorist and other illegal activities would be undertaken at the site. Rutherford County, Tenn., is the defendant in the civil case, and had granted permission for the construction of the mosque. The county is opposing the landowners' attempt to stop construction.\nEqual Rights Center v. AvalonBay Communities (D. Md.)\nEqual Rights Center v. Equity Residential (D. Md.)\nOn March 31, 2016, the court entered an opinion and order on the parties' partial summary judgment motions in Equal Rights Center v. Equity Residential (D. Md.), an FHA design and construction case involving multiple properties in numerous states. On November 13, 2014, the United States filed a statement of interest in support of the Equal Rights Center's summary judgment motion. The brief argues that 1) violations of the HUD Fair Housing Amendments Act Guidelines establish a prima facie case that the Act's design and construction provisions have been violated, which may be overcome only by showing compliance with a comparable, objective accessibility standard; and 2) the failure to design and construct accessible multifamily housing is a discrete violation of the Fair Housing Act and does not require that an individual be denied housing based on disability. The court's opinion adopted the United States' argument that the plaintiff in a design-and-construction case may demonstrate liability by showing that the defendant did not follow the HUD FHA Guidelines, and that the defendant may overcome this showing only by demonstrating compliance with another, comparable accessibility standard. The court also rejected the defendants' argument that a more subjective standard for accessibility should control. Finally, the court agreed that demonstrating violations of the FHA's accessibility requirements did not require a showing that an actual buyer or renter was denied housing.\nEqual Rights Center v. Post Properties (D.D.C.)\nFair Housing of the Dakotas v. Goldmark Property Management Co. (D. N.D.)\nSettlement Agreement between United States and F & K Management, Inc., d/b/a Hard Times Cafes and Santa Fe Cue Clubs (Springfield and Herndon, Virginia)\nOn February 28, 2003, the United States entered into a settlement agreement with F & K Management, Inc., d/b/a Hard Times Cafes and Santa Fe Cue Clubs, to resolve a complaint brought to the attention of the Division's National Origin Working Group (NOWG) by the Sikh Coalition, a national Sikh advocacy group. The Coalition reported that on September 23, 2001, a young Indian-American Sikh was told by a manager to remove his turban or leave at its Springfield, Virginia club. The Division's investigation revealed that F & K had promulgated and posted a policy in its clubs prohibiting head coverings with the exception of cowboy hats and baseball caps. Pursuant to the agreement, F & K rescinded its head covering policy and replaced it with a dress code approved by the United States, posted nondiscrimination signs at the five (5) establishments it owns and/or operates, agreed to place periodic nondiscrimination ads in the Washington Post and local and national Sikh and Muslim publications over a 3-year period, and arranged for periodic training of its owners and employees by Sikh and Islamic organizations over the three-year term of the agreement. In addition, F & K's owner wrote a formal letter of apology to the complainant and provided free dinner and pool playing privileges for use by him, his family and friends.\nFirst Boston Real Estate (Okla.)\nOn June 28, 2000, the United States signed a settlement agreement with a real estate company settling our allegations that one of its former agents violated the Fair Housing Act on the basis of race by engaging in a pattern or practice of discrimination in the sale of a dwelling. The settlement agreement obligates the real estate company, First Boston Real Estate, to implement a non-discriminatory policy, which will be displayed in its offices and distributed to any persons who inquire about the availability of any properties, as well as to all agents. There are reporting requirements and the Metropolitan Fair Housing Council of Oklahoma City, Oklahoma will receive $3,000.00 in compensatory damages.\nFortune Society, Inc. v. Sandcastle Towers Housing Development Fund Corp. (E.D.N.Y.)\nGarden State Islamic Center v. City of Vineland, NJ (D. N.J.)\nGomez v. Quicken Loans (C.D. Cal.)\nOn April 1, 2013, the Division filed a statement of interest in Gomez v. Quicken Loans (C.D. Cal.), a case alleging that Quicken Loans discriminated against borrowers with disabilities by requiring that they provide a letter from a doctor as a condition of their loans. The statement of interest states that (1) Smith v. City of Jackson did not overrule, explicitly or implicitly, decades of Fair Housing Act disparate impact precedent, (2) disparate treatment claims do not require proof of ill intent, and (3) Equal Credit Opportunity Act claims do not require a denial of credit. The court dismissed the complaint and Mr. Gomez filed an appeal in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. The Division filed an amicus brief in the Court of Appeals on January 16, 2014. The Ninth Circuit ruled on November 2, 2015, holding that plaintiff pled a disparate treatment claim by alleging that \"disabled individuals like Gomez were subject to the presumption that their SSDI award letters were insufficient evidence of income and [were] asked to meet a higher standard of proof [of income] than other applicants.\" The case was remanded to the District Court.\nGordon v. Pete's Auto Service of Denbigh, Inc. (4th Cir.)\nOn February 14, 2011, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit issued an opinion holding that the SCRA amendments providing an express private right of action for damages should apply to this case. On October 27, 2010, the Division participated in oral argument as amicus in Gordon v. Pete's Auto Service of Denbigh, Inc. (4th Cir.), supporting the servicemember's argument that there is a private right of action to enforce the provision of the SCRA that requires lienholders to get a court order before enforcing a lien on a servicemember's property. The court ordered supplemental briefing on whether amendments made to the SCRA on October 13, 2010, adding an explicit private right of action, are retroactive. On November 29, 2010, the Division filed a supplemental amicus arguing that the amendment providing an express private right of action for damages should apply retroactively in this case.\nGroome and United States v. Jefferson Parrish (E.D. La.)\nIn June 1999, the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana held that Jefferson Parish violated the Fair Housing Act when it refused to permit the operation of a group residence for five adults with Alzheimer's Disease. The Parish zoning ordinance required the group home provider to seek an accommodation to house five persons instead of the permitted four. The court held that the Parish broke the law when it failed to act on the request because of opposition from neighborhood residents and a member of the Parish Board. The Parish appealed the decision to the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, arguing that the Fair Housing Act protections for persons with disabilities are unconstitutional. The Civil Rights Division intervened and filed a brief arguing that Congress had power to pass the legislation under both the Commerce Clause and the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution. The United States also filed an amicus brief in the district court. On November 20, 2000, a unanimous three-judge panel joined three other Courts of Appeal holding that the Commerce Clause authorizes Congress to regulate the housing market.\nHamad v. Woodcrest Condominiums Association (E.D. Mich.)\nHand in Hand/Mano en Mano v. Town of Milbridge, Maine (D. Me.)\nOn March 16, 2010, the case settled before the court ruled on the issue raised in the United States amicus brief. On November 17, 2009, the court granted the United States' motion for leave to file a brief as amicus curiae in Hand in Hand/Mano en Mano v. Town of Milbridge, Maine C.A. No. 1:09cv287 (D. Me.). In this case, defendant Town of Milbridge adopted a moratorium that halted development of plaintiff's proposed housing project of farmworkers and their families. The plaintiff alleges that the moratorium was adopted because of resident opposition based on the national origin and familial status of the prospective residents. Our amicus brief was submitted in connection with plaintiff's motion for a preliminary injunction. We did not take a position on the merits, but set out our view as to the applicable legal principles.\nHargraves v. Capitol City Mortgage Corp. (D.D.C.)\nIn this lawsuit against Capital City Mortgage Corp. and its president and Thomas Nash, private plaintiffs contend that the company targeted minorities for loans that were designed to fail, due to unfair payment terms and income levels of the borrowers that would not sustain the loan payments. In their complaint, the plaintiffs claim that Capital City's lending practices violated several federal laws, including the Fair Housing and the Equal Credit Opportunity Acts by engaging in a pattern or practice of targeting African American communities, a practice known as \"reverse redlining,\" for abusive or predatory lending practices. The defendants filed a motion for summary judgment on the grounds that reverse redlining does not violate either law because they have provided credit to African Americans, and on the same terms that they would provide to whites. On March 23, 2000, the United States filed an amicus brief, which supported the view that lending practices designed to induce minorities into loans destined to fail could violate the fair lending laws. The brief argues that by targeting minorities for predatory loans, a lender discriminates in the terms and conditions of home financing, even if it makes all or most of its loans in minority areas. The fact that a lender does business only in minority neighborhoods does not shield its business from scrutiny under federal fair lending laws. In addition, racially targeted loans that are designed to fail make housing unavailable because of race since the borrowers are likely to lose their homes through foreclosure. The matter was settled and dismissed on March 27, 2002. The Federal Trade Commission has filed a separate action charging the same defendants with violating a number of federal consumer protection laws. FTC v. Capital City Mortgage Corp., No. 98-237 (JHG/AK) (D.D.C. filed Jan. 29, 1998). The matter was settled on March 14, 2005.\nHomecomings Financial, LLC\nOn December 12, 2008, Homecomings Financial, LLC and GMAC Mortgage, LLC and their affiliates, including but not limited to GMAC Bank and Residential Funding Company, LLC, agreed to resolve our Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (SCRA) investigation. This matter arose when United States Air Force Master Sergeant Brenda S. Gomez received permanent change of station orders transferring her from Tinker Air Force Base to Vance Air Force Base. When she sold her home to move closer to the new base, Homecomings denied MSgt Gomez's request to waive the prepayment penalty on her residential mortgage loan. As a result of the Justice Department's investigation, Homecomings has refunded MSgt Gomez's $9,144 prepayment penalty and has agreed to waive the prepayment penalties of servicemembers in the future who are transferred involuntarily to a base thirty miles or more from their current residence.\nHope Lutheran Church v. City of St. Ignace (W.D. Mich.)\nJagannath Organization for Global Awareness, Inc. v. Howard County, Maryland (D. Md.)\nJ & R Associates (D. Mass.)\nOn July 6, 2017, the United States entered into a settlement agreement with J & R Associates, the owner and operator of the Royal Park Apartments, a 224-unit multi-family housing complex in North Attleboro, Massachusetts. The settlement resolves allegations that J & R Associates discriminated against tenants of South Asian descent in violation of the Fair Housing Act, which prohibits housing discrimination on the basis of race and national origin. Under the terms of the agreement, J & R Associates will establish a $70,000 settlement fund to compensate victims of the discriminatory practices. J & R Associates also has agreed to train any new employees and to comply with the Fair Housing Act going forward. In a related matter resolved in 2015, J & R Associates agreed to make changes to its rental practices to resolve allegations that it had been steering families with children to certain buildings and units in violation of the Fair Housing Act.\nJubilee Apartments\nLouisiana ACORN Fair Housing v. LeBlanc (5th Cir.)\nIn consolidated cases brought by the United States and Louisiana ACORN Fair Housing and Gene Lewis, plaintiffs alleged that the defendant, the owner and operator of an apartment complex in Lake Charles, Louisiana, intentionally discriminated on the basis of race against Gene Lewis when he refused to rent him a studio apartment. On September 15, 1998, the jury found liability against Danny LeBlanc and awarded Gene Lewis no compensatory damages, but $10,000 in punitive damages. LeBlanc appealed the judgment, arguing that Lewis' punitive damages award should be vacated because the jury awarded him neither compensatory nor nominal damage. On June 10, 1999, the Division filed an amicus brief in the Fifth Circuit arguing that the Fair Housing Act permits an award of punitive damages in the absence of compensatory or nominal damages, and that the district court had properly entered judgment in accordance with the jury's verdict awarding punitive damages to Gene Lewis. On May 15, 2000, the Fifth Circuit reversed and vacated the jury's punitive damages award to Gene Lewis, holding that a plaintiff suing under the Fair Housing Act may not receive punitive damages absent an award of compensatory or nominal damages. The Supreme Court denied certiorari on March 5, 2001.\nMagner v. Gallagher (No. 10-1032)\nHunter v. The District of Columbia (D.D.C.)\nLoveless v.

Tenn.)\nMetropolitan St. Louis Equal Housing Opportunity Council v. Gundacker Real Estate, Co. (E.D. Mo.)\nMouton v. Augustine (W.D. La.)\nMt. Holly Gardens Citizens in Action, Inc., et al. v. Township of Mount Holly (3rd Cir.)\nNational Fair Housing Alliance v. Facebook, Inc. (S.D.N.Y.)\nOn August 17, 2018, the United States Attorney’s Office filed a statement of interest in National Fair Housing Alliance v. Facebook (S.D.N.Y.), a Fair Housing Act case.  The complaint alleges that Facebook’s classification of its users and its ad targeting tools permit landlords, developers, and housing service providers to limit the audience for their ads based on sex, religion, familial status, and national origin in violation of the FHA.  Facebook moved to dismiss, arguing, among other things, that the Communications Decency Act immunizes it from the FHA.  The Statement of Interest argues that the CDA does not prevent an FHA lawsuit against Facebook for the conduct alleged in the complaint.\nNational Fair Housing Alliance v. Hunt Investments, LLC (E.D. Va.)\nNational Fair Housing Alliance, Inc. v. Spanos (N.D. Cal.)\nNelson v. HUD (9th Cir.)\nOpulent Life Church v. City of Holly Springs (5th Circuit)\nOnuoha v. Facebook (N.D. Cal.)\nOn November 16, 2018, the United States Attorney’s Office filed a statement of interest in Onuoha v. Facebook (N.D. Cal.).  In the case, the plaintiffs allege that Facebook uses its data collection and advertising tools to segregate users of the platform into different groups by race and national origin.  That, according to the lawsuit, allows property owners and developers to target and exclude certain users according to those characteristics from seeing housing-related advertisements, in violation of the Fair Housing Act.  The statement of interest argues that the plaintiffs have alleged sufficient facts to support a claim of housing discrimination under the Fair Housing Act, and that Facebook does not have statutory immunity under the Communications Decency Act for the development of its data collection and advertising tools.\nPacific Mercantile Bank\nProperty Casualty Insurers Association of America v. Donovan (N.D. Ill.)\nPulte Home Corporation\nThe United States signed a modification agreement with Pulte Home Corporation (Pulte) to supplement and amend a settlement agreement previously entered into with Pulte in July 1998. The 1998 settlement agreement resolved the United States' allegations that Pulte had failed to design and construct certain developments in Florida, Illinois, and Virginia to be accessible to persons with disabilities as required by the Fair Housing Act. The modification agreement covers three additional properties in Las Vegas, Nevada, and includes provisions requiring Pulte to annually notify current owners, for a period of three years, of their option to have Pulte retrofit their units at no expense to them in order to bring them in compliance with the Act, as well as to report to the United States the names and addresses of those persons who elect to have their units retrofitted.\nRamapough Mountain Indians, Inc. v. Township of Mahwah (D. N.J.)\nOn March 18, 2019, the United States filed a Statement of Interest in Ramapough Mountain Indians, Inc. v. Township of Mahwah (D. N.J.), a case brought under the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act (RLUIPA).  In September 2018, the Ramapough Mountain Indians, a Native American tribe, moved to file an amended complaint (“Complaint”) alleging RLUIPA claims against the Township of Mahwah, NJ (“Township”).  The complaint alleges that the Ramapough sought to worship communally and erect religious structures, including a sweat lodge and prayer circle, on their land, but that the Township tried to bar the tribe's worship practices by rescinding a zoning permit that authorized religious worship, limiting the number of people permitted on the property to worship, demanding the removal of structures central to the Ramapough’s worship, issuing large fines, and initiating civil and criminal enforcement proceedings.  The tribe also alleges that the Township treated it differently from other similarly situated nonreligious groups.  The Township opposed the Ramapough’s motion to amend, arguing that the complaint failed to allege facts sufficient to state claims under RLUIPA and that the RLUIPA claims were not ripe for judicial review.  The United States’ Statement of Interest argues that the facts alleged by the Ramapough state substantial burden and unequal treatment claims under RLUIPA.  The Statement of Interest further argues that the RLUIPA claims, which allege that the Township’s conduct has “significantly chilled Ramapough’s use of the land for religious purposes,” are ripe and can be heard by the court.\nReading Housing Authority\nRedeemer Fellowship of Edisto Island v. Town of Edisto Beach (D. S.C.)\nOn November 18, 2018, the United States filed a Statement of Interest in U.S. District Court in South Carolina supporting a church’s claim that the Town of Edisto Beach violated its rights under the First Amendment when the Town barred it from renting space at the Town’s Civic Center.  The case, Redeemer Fellowship of Edisto Island v. Town of Edisto Beach, involves a small Christian congregation that sought to rent space for Sunday worship in the Civic Center, which is available for rental by community groups to hold events and activities.  The Town responded by enacting a policy barring worship services at the Civic Center, citing separation of church and state concerns.  The church filed a First Amendment suit and sought a preliminary injunction to allow it to rent the facility.  The United States’ statement of interest argues that far from being a justification for barring the church from the facility, the Constitution requires that churches be allowed to rent facilities on an equal basis with other community groups.  The United States notes that the Supreme Court in 1981 held that a university could not “discriminate against student groups and speakers based on their desire to use a generally open forum to engage in religious worship and discussion,” and that later cases make clear this applies to other types of forums opened up by governments.  On December 31, 2018, the Town voluntarily rescinded its ban on religious worship services at its Civic Center.  On March 18, 2019, the court issued an order dismissing the church’s request for a preliminary injunction as moot because the Town remedied the illegal conduct through a legislative enactment. The court keeps the church’s requests for damages and declaratory relief, however, and orders that the private parties work the issue of damages out amongst themselves.\nReed, et al. v. Penasquitos Casablanca Owner's Association (9th Cir.)\nA federal court jury in San Diego, California found that the defendants employee, a condominium security guard, had sexually harassed the plaintiff. However, the judge refused to let the claims of the plaintiff's two sons and grandson go to the jury. The judge also refused to let the jury consider whether to grant punitive damages. The plaintiffs appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, and the Civil Rights Division filed an amicus brief on November 7, 2008, arguing that the claims of the children should have gone to the jury, and the judge should have allowed the jury to decide whether to award punitive damages.\nRegional Economic Community Action Program, Inc. v.

(Nev.)\nOn March 14, 2001, the United States entered into a settlement agreement with Trop-Edmond, L.P.; Trail Properties, Inc.; and Danielian Associates (respondents), thereby resolving the United States' claims that respondents discriminated on the basis of disability by failing to design and construct units at West Trop Condominiums in Las Vegas, Nevada, to make them accessible to persons with disabilities. This case was referred to the Division by HUD as a pattern or practice case. After respondents were contacted by HUD regarding a complaint of design and construction deficiencies, respondents took corrective actions at an approximate cost of $41,000. Under the terms of the settlement, respondents Trop-Edmond, L.P. and Trail Properties, Inc. will donate $5000 to an organization in Nevada that serves the housing needs of persons with disabilities. Respondent Danielian will conduct annual in-house training for a period of three years to its employees involved in the design of multi-family dwellings.\nTrujillo v. Board of Directors of Triumvera Tower Condominium Association (N.D. Ill.)\nOn September 8, 2004, the court entered a consent order resolving Trujillo v. Board of Directors of Triumvera Tower Condominium Association (N.D. Ill.). The United States' complaint, which was filed on May 13, 2004, alleged the condominium association engaged in a pattern or practice of discrimination on the basis of disability when they established a written policy prohibiting persons in wheelchairs from using the front door to the condominium building and when they applied that policy to a ten-year-old boy who uses a wheelchair who lives in the building. The consent order requires the defendants to: pay $70,000 to the complainants; admit that their actions violated the Fair Housing Act; issue a letter of apology; pay $10,000 to the widow of a Triumvera resident who used a wheelchair during the last years of his life, and pay a $3,500 civil penalty. The consent order also requires the president of the association's board of directors to resign, issue new by-laws, and require training of its members on the provisions of the Fair Housing Act. The complainants filed a lawsuit in this matter in March, 2004.\nTurning Point Foundation v. DeStefano (D. Conn.)\nOn May 13, 2008, the court denied plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment in Turning Point Foundation v. DeStefano (D. Conn.). This is a Fair Housing Act disability discrimination case filed by the owners of two recovery houses for people with addictions, who allege that the city of New Haven failed to make a reasonable accommodation by allowing more than eight to ten persons to reside in the houses. On February 22, 2008, the United States filed a brief as amicus curiae to address legal issues raised by defendants, without taking a position on the merits of the summary judgment motion. The court's opinion, which was entered on May 13, 2008,  found that there are material issues of fact in dispute, without addressing any of the contested legal issues.\nVeles v.

Ashford County Housing Authority (M.D. Ala.)\nUnited States v. Associates National Bank (D. Del.)\nOn March 29, 1999, the United States filed a lawsuit against Associates National Bank of Delaware [ANB], a leading issuer of Visa and MasterCard bank cards, claiming that the bank violated the Equal Credit Opportunity Act [ECOA] by discriminating on the basis of national origin, specifically, against persons of Hispanic origin. Our complaint asserted that individuals applying for an ANB/UNOCAL MasterCard through the bank's Spanish-language application were processed through a separate approval system, which utilized a credit scoring system that required higher scores than those required for English-language applicants. As a consequence, some Spanish-language applicants were denied credit on a discriminatory basis. The United States also claimed that approved Spanish-language UNOCAL applicants were given lower credit line assignments than applicants processed through the English-language decision system. Finally, we contended that the bank offered different promotional credit services to those who applied through the Spanish-language system from those commonly offered to other customers. The United States estimate that as a result of ANB's actions, approximately 1,800 Hispanic applicants and customers who utilized ANB's Spanish-language applications were adversely affected.\nUnder the settlement agreement ANB will establish a $1.5 million Compensation Fund to provide damages to hundreds of Hispanic applicants who faced stricter underwriting standards and less favorable credit terms and conditions than those who applied in English between late February 1996 and April 1997. Any funds remaining after all claims have been paid will be used for consumer education in Hispanic communities.

N.M.)\nUnited States v. Village of Addison (N.D. Ill.)\nOn February 10, 1998, the court entered a consent decree resolving United States v. Village of Addison (N.D. Ill.). The complaint, filed on July 7, 1995, alleged that the Village of Addison violated the Fair Housing Act on the basis of national origin. The complaint alleged that the Village planned and began the acquisition and demolition of dwellings in the two largest Hispanic communities in the Village by acquiring, demolishing, and planning to continue to demolish affordable and decent housing in those communities. The complaint further alleged that, in 1994, the Village, pursuant to the State of Illinois Tax Increment Allocation Redevelopment Act, Section 65 ILCS/11-74.4-3, created two redevelopment districts, the Army Trail/Mill Road and Michael Lane Tax Increment Financing districts (the \"TIF districts\"), as the means to accomplish these ends. The complaint also alleged that, through implementation of these TIF districts, the Village violated the Fair Housing Act by seeking to displace Hispanic families residing in these areas. Under the terms of the consent decree the Village shall: pay $5,000 to each of the forty-four households in Green Oaks who were relocated as a result of the Village's acquisition and/or removal of buildings prior to the entry of this consent decree; establish a fund in the amount of $100,000 for private plaintiffs representing the class pursuant to the notice; pay $1, 000 to any household displaced in the center core of Green Oaks Courts pursuant to the implementation of the Plan; pay $60,000 to Hispanics United of DuPage County, the Hispanic Council, and the Leadership Council for Metropolitan Open Communities; pay $30,000 into an interest-bearing account to be used in furtherance of fair housing in Addison by enhancing awareness of the requirements of federal fair housing laws.

The Village shall implement a comprehensive Redevelopment Plan for affordable, multi-family, owner-occupied housing.

Village of Airmont (S.D.N.Y.)\nUnited States v. Village of Hatch (D. N.M.)\nOn December 12, 1996, the court entered a consent decree resolving United States v. Village of Hatch (D. N.M.). The complaint, filed on June 15, 1995, alleged that from 1986, the Village of Hatch, through its Mayor and Board of Trustees, has engaged in a course of municipal action intended to prevent permanent resident aliens of Mexican national origin from living in the Village. This course of action has been carried out, among other ways, through the use of zoning and land use policies which have effectively removed mobile homes as a source of affordable housing for such persons. In 1986, the Village of Hatch, through its Mayor and Board of Trustees, passed a moratorium on mobile homes being moved into the Village. On or about January 22, 1990, the Village Board of Trustees adopted Ordinance Number 233, entitled Village of Hatch Municipal Zoning Ordinance (\"the 1990 zoning ordinance\"). The 1990 zoning ordinance effectively prohibited all \"non-grandfathered\" mobile homes in the Village. On or about August 12, 1993, the Village Board of Trustees adopted Ordinance Number 256, entitled Village of Hatch Comprehensive Zoning Ordinance (\"the 1993 zoning ordinance\"). The 1993 zoning ordinance effectively prohibits all mobile homes not located within a lawful mobile home park, and severely limits the areas within the Village where mobile home parks are allowed. Statements by Village officials indicate that a purpose of the 1990 and 1993 zoning ordinances was to remove permanent resident aliens of Mexican national origin from the Village, and to help insure that such persons would not reside in the Village in the future. Part of the geographic area from which mobile homes are banned under the 1993 zoning ordinance includes Elm Street, a neighborhood populated predominantly by permanent resident aliens of Mexican national origin at the time of the passage of the 1993 zoning ordinance. The defendant was aware of the large concentration of families with permanent resident aliens of Mexican national origin which resided in mobile homes on Elm Street before it formally adopted the 1993 zoning ordinance, and before it began enforcing such ordinance. Defendant selected the mobile homes located on Elm Street for exclusive enforcement of the 1993 zoning ordinance because of the large concentration of families with permanent resident aliens of Mexican national origin which resided in mobile homes on Elm Street. Under the terms of the consent decree the Village of Hatch is; permanently enjoined from enforcing ordinance 256 entitled Village of Hatch Comprehensive Zoning Ordinance; shall rezone and amend its zoning code to induce the use of mobile home parks in the Village of Hatch through zoning incentives used in conjunction with various programs; shall establish a housing plan and infrastructure; apply for HUD rental rehabilitation funds; create a new construction program to support the development of new single family residences on vacant lots within the Village for low income families; develop a fair housing policy; train employees; and periodically report to the United States. The Village is also required to pay $260,500.00 to aggrieved parties and a $2,000 civil penalty to the United States. The consent decree shall remain in effect for three years.\nUnited States v. Village of South Elgin (N.D. Ill.)\nOn December 13, 2006, the court entered a consent decree in United States v. Village of South Elgin (N.D. Ill.). In this pattern or practice case under the Fair Housing Act, the Division alleged that the defendant municipality discriminated against Unity House, a \"sober home\" providing a supportive environment for recovering alcoholics and drug users, by denying it a permit to house up to nine residents. The home had operated from 2000 to 2003 without a permit, because the owner believed he was not required to obtain one. After the permit was denied, Unity House continued to operate legally with five residents. The complaint, filed on September 15, 2005, alleged that the Village Board's actions were taken on account of the disability of the residents, in violation of Section 804(f)(1) of the Fair Housing Act, and also that the Village failed to make a reasonable accommodation in violation of Section 804(f)(3)(b). Defendants moved to dismiss pursuant to Rules 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6), on the grounds that in seeking a reasonable accommodation, Unity House had not complied with the procedural requirements of state zoning law. On March 6, 2006, Judge Amy St. Eve denied defendant's motion to dismiss. In denying the motion, the court agreed with our argument that (1) assuming this to be true, it would not affect our entitlement to recover under an intentional discrimination theory, and (2) whether Unity House complied with the state law involves disputed issues of fact. Under the consent decree the Village agreed to grant Unity House a permit to house seven residents; the permit was granted by the Village Board on December 5, 2006. The Village will pay $25,000 in monetary damages to the owner, and $7,500 to each of two residents who were forced to leave the home in 2003, as well as a $15,000 civil penalty. The decree also provides for training of employees and record-keeping and reporting. This matter was litigated jointly by this Section and the United States Attorney's Office.\nUnited States v. Village of Suffern (S.D.N.Y.)\nUnited States v. Village of Tinley Park, Illinois (N.D. Ill.)\nOn August 24, 2018, the United States Attorney’s Office executed a settlement agreement in the United States v. Tinley Park, Illinois (N.D. Ill).  The complaint, filed on November 23, 2016, alleged that the village engaged in a pattern or practice of unlawful discrimination and denied rights to a group of persons on the basis of race and color in violation of the Fair Housing Act, when it refused to permit the construction of an affordable housing project in response to racially motivated public opposition. On July 17, 2017, the court issued an order denying defendant’s motion to dismiss. Under the settlement, the Village will pay a total of $360,000 in monetary damages to the Village’s former planning director who was placed on leave because of her support for the project, as well as a $50,000 civil penalty to the United States. In addition, the Village will also take a number of actions to guard against further housing discrimination, including training  elected officials and individuals involved in the planning process, developing a fair housing policy, and hiring a fair housing compliance officer. The case was jointly handled with the United States Attorney’s Office.\nUnited States v. Village Realty of Staten Island Ltd. (E.D.N.Y.)\nUnited States v. Vlahakis (N.D. Ill.)\nUnited States v.

The agreement requires the defendants to pay $11,000 to the HUD complainants and participate in fair housing training, as well as additional relief.  The case was referred to the Division after the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) received a complaint, conducted an investigation, and issued a charge of discrimination.\nUnited States v.

Albert Zadow (in his \"official capacity\" as Marshall of the Village of Vinita Terrace) and the Village of Vinita Terrace, Missouri (E.D. Mo.)\nUnited States v. Zellpac Inc. (S.D. Ill.)\nA trial was held in Benton, Illinois on June 19-20, 2006 in the case of United States v. Zellpac Inc. (S.D. Ill.). The complaint, filed on February 17, 2005, alleged that the defendant Guy Emery, the rental manager discriminated on the basis of disability. In late November 2001, the complainant responded to an ad in the local newspaper for an apartment and told defendant Guy Emery that he was looking for an apartment for his mother who used a wheelchair. On or about December 17, 2001, the complainant met with defendant Guy Emery and viewed the apartment. During this meeting, the plaintiff again told defendant Guy Emery that he was looking at the apartment on behalf of his mother who used a wheelchair. On or about December 17, 2001, Guy Emery and Zellpac, Inc., refused to rent to plaintiff's mother. According to the complaint, Defendant Guy Emery told the son he would not rent to her because he did not want the liability of her slipping on the ice and getting injured. The complainant told Mr. Emery that refusing to rent to her because she used a wheelchair violated federal anti-discrimination laws. The Defendant Emery responded \"so sue me.\" At trial, the jury returned a verdict finding that Zellpac and Emery had violated the disability provision's of the Fair Housing Act. Although the jury answered \"No\" to the verdict question \"Do you find by the preponderance of the evidence that the defendants violated the Fair Housing Act by refusing to rent an apartment to (DNA), or otherwise making an apartment unavailable to her, because she used a wheelchair?\" They awarded damages based on their \"Yes\" to \"Do you find by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendants violated the Fair Housing Act by Guy Emery's statement, either to (CN) or (DNA), with respect to the rental of an apartment, that indicated a preference, limitations, or discrimination, or an intention to make such a preference, limitation, or discrimination, on the basis that (DNA) used a wheelchair.\" The jury awarded $5,000 in compensatory damages, $3,000 in punitive damages against Defendant Emery, and $7,000 in punitive damages against Defendant Zellpac, Inc. On February 27, 2006, the United States filed an Opposition to Defendant Zellpac's Inc.'s Motion For Partial Judgment.\nUnited States v. Zenith of Nevada, Inc., f/k/a Perma-Bilt (D. Nev.)\nUSAA Federal Savings Bank v. Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission (E.D. Pa.)\nOn April 28, 2011, the United States filed a statement of interest in support of the Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission (PHRC). In this case, USAA sought to enjoin PHRC's investigation of an individual's Fair Housing Act complaint. The complaint, which was referred to PHRC for investigation by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) alleged that USAA discriminated on the basis of nation origin in making a home loan. USAA's injunction lawsuit alleged that federal banking law preempts state agencies, including PHRC, which enforce state laws prohibiting lending discrimination from investigating a federally chartered bank. The statement of interest argued that preemption does not apply because the Fair Housing Act specifically provides for state agencies to investigate housing discrimination complaints when they are certified by HUD as having laws and enforcement procedures that are substantially equivalent to the federal law. PHRC has been certified by HUD as one such agency. On August 23, 2011, the court granted summary judgment in favor of PHRC and refused to enjoin the investigation. The court's opinion held PHRC's investigation \"is not subject to federal preemption\" because it is specifically authorized and required by federal law,\" as set out in the Fair Housing Act. The court reasoned that granting USAA's request \"would render the FHA anti-discrimination provision a nullity and unenforceable where a federal savings and loan institution discriminated\" and \"would frustrate the antidiscrimination enforcement scheme intended by Congress.\" The court also stated that federal banking law does not preempt state antidiscrimination laws that require banks to follow the same requirements as federal fair lending law.\nUnited States v.
