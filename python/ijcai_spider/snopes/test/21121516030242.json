            "report_content": "Tuesday afternoon, Stephen Braun and Eileen Sullivan of the Associated Press released the results of a review of State Department appointment data that they used to make some striking claims about Hillary Clinton’s schedule as secretary of state.\nAccording to their reporting, Clinton spent a remarkably large share of her time as America’s chief diplomat talking to people who had donated money to the Clinton Foundation. She went out of her way to help these Clinton Foundation donors, and her decision to do so raises important concerns about the ethics of her conduct as secretary and potentially as president. It’s a striking piece of reporting that made immediate waves in my social media feed, as political journalists of all stripes retweeted the story’s headline conclusions.\nExcept it turns out not to be true. The nut fact that the AP uses to lead its coverage is wrong, and Braun and Sullivan’s reporting reveals absolutely no unethical conduct. In fact, they found so little unethical conduct that an enormous amount of space is taken up by a detailed recounting of the time Clinton tried to help a former Nobel Peace Prize winner who’s also the recipient of a Congressional Gold Medal and a Presidential Medal of Freedom.\nHere’s the bottom line: Serving as secretary of state while your husband raises millions of dollars for a charitable foundation that is also a vehicle for your family’s political ambitions really does create a lot of space for potential conflicts of interest. Journalists have, rightly, scrutinized the situation closely. And however many times they take a run at it, they don’t come up with anything more scandalous than the revelation that maybe billionaire philanthropists have an easier time getting the State Department to look into their visa problems than an ordinary person would.\nMore than a year ago, Jon Allen wrote for Vox about the special \"Clinton Rules\" that have governed much reporting on Bill and Hillary Clinton over the past 25 years. On the list are the notions that even the most ridiculous charges are worthy of massive investigation, that the Clintons’ bad faith will always be presumed, and that actions that would normally be deemed banal are newsworthy simply because the Clintons are involved.\nThe blockbuster AP story released Tuesday afternoon fits the model to a T.\nStart with this card the AP used to promote the story on social media:\nThe point of a card like this is that it will be seen and shared by many more people than click through and read the story itself.\nThe AP’s teaser tweet, similarly, will be more widely seen and shared than the underlying story.\nBREAKING: AP analysis: More than half those who met Clinton as Cabinet secretary gave money to Clinton Foundation.\nAnd within the story itself, of course, the most-read part will be the lead paragraph, which reads:\nMore than half the people outside the government who met with Hillary Clinton while she was secretary of state gave money — either personally or through companies or groups — to the Clinton Foundation. It's an extraordinary proportion indicating her possible ethics challenges if elected president.\nThe basic allegation here, that the majority of the people Clinton met with as secretary of state were Clinton Foundation donors, is remarkable. And the implication that the investigation that unearthed this striking fact has also revealed \"ethics challenges\" is important. The many Americans who already have a negative view of Clinton will see these facts ricocheting through their feeds and appearing on Fox chyrons and will further entrench their negative views.\nOnly a relatively small handful of people will actually read the story from beginning to end and see that there’s no there there.\nWatch: Clinton on negative attacks, misinformation and her approval ratings\nThe stark fact highlighted in the AP’s tweet and social share card is, for starters, totally false.\nIf you read that and thought to yourself that it seems wrong for the secretary of state to be spending so much time in meetings with Clinton Foundation donors rather than talking to US government officials and representatives of foreign countries, then you are in luck. To generate the 154 figure, the AP excluded from the denominator all employees of any government, whether US or foreign. Then when designing social media collateral, it just left out that part, because the truth is less striking and shareable.\nEven so, the number 154 is preposterously low, as Clinton would routinely meet dozens of civil society leaders, journalists, and others on any one of her many foreign trips as secretary of state. In the campaign’s official response to the AP, they argue that the data is \"cherry picked\" from a \"limited subset\" of her schedule.\nBut regardless of that, the AP’s social media claims are simply false — ignoring well over 1,000 official meetings with foreign leaders and an unknown number of meetings with domestic US officials.\nRegardless of the denominator, there is still the fact that Clinton had meetings with more than 80 people who also directly or indirectly donated to the Clinton Foundation or related ventures.\nAs the AP puts it: \"[T]he frequency of the overlaps shows the intermingling of access and donations, and fuels perceptions that giving the foundation money was a price of admission for face time with Clinton.\"\nWith that lead-in, one is naturally primed to read some scandalous material — a case of someone with a legitimately crucial need to sit down with the secretary of state whose meeting is held up until he can produce cash, or a person with no business getting face time with the secretary nevertheless receiving privileged access in exchange for money. Instead, the most extensively discussed case the AP could come up with is this:\nMuhammad Yunus, a Bangladeshi economist who won the 2006 Nobel Peace Prize for pioneering low-interest \"microcredit\" for poor business owners, met with Clinton three times and talked with her by phone during a period when Bangladeshi government authorities investigated his oversight of a nonprofit bank and ultimately pressured him to resign from the bank's board. Throughout the process, he pleaded for help in messages routed to Clinton, and she ordered aides to find ways to assist him.\nI have no particular knowledge of Yunus, Grameen Bank, or the general prospects of microcredit as a philanthropic venture. I can tell you, however, that Yunus not only won the 2006 Nobel Peace Prize but has also been honored with a Presidential Medal of Freedom and a Congressional Gold Medal. In 2008 he was No. 2 on Foreign Policy’s list of the \"top 100 global thinkers,\" and Ted Turner put him on the board of the UN Foundation. He’s received the World Food Prize, the International Simon Bolivar Prize, and the Prince of Asturias Award for Concord.\nIn other words, he’s a renowned and beloved figure throughout the West, not some moneybags getting help from the State Department in exchange for cash. On the level of pure politics, of course, this is exactly the problem with the Clinton Foundation. Its existence turns the banal into a potential conflict of interest, and shutting it down is the right call. But the fact remains that this is a fantastically banal anecdote.\nEqually banal is this finding: \"[I]n December that same year, Schwarzman's wife, Christine, sat at Clinton's table during the Kennedy Center Honors. Clinton also introduced Schwarzman, then chairman of the Kennedy Center, before he spoke.\"\nOf course the secretary of state introduced the chair of the Kennedy Center when she attended the Kennedy Center Honors. More substantively, Braun and Sullivan also note that \"the State Department was working on a visa issue at Schwarzman's request.\" One could imagine a scandal here, but the AP doesn’t produce one — was a visa wrongly issued? Or was the State Department simply doing its job and fixing a problem?\nThe State Department doing its job seems to clearly be the story of the time \"Clinton also met in June 2011 with Nancy Mahon of the MAC AIDS, the charitable arm of MAC Cosmetics, which is owned by Estee Lauder.\" Was the meeting about Mahon trying to swing a plumb internship for a family member? Nope! As the story concedes, \"the meeting occurred before an announcement about a State Department partnership to raise money to finance AIDS education and prevention.\"\nMeeting with the head of a charity as part of an effort to raise charitable money is just the system working properly. Read the meat of the article, and the most shocking revelation is what’s not in it — a genuinely interesting example of influence peddling.\nThe State Department is a big operation. So is the Clinton Foundation. The AP put a lot of work into this project. And it couldn’t come up with anything that looks worse than helping a Nobel Prize winner, raising money to finance AIDS education, and doing an introduction for the chair of the Kennedy Center. It’s kind of surprising.\nPublication bias is the name of a well-known but hard to solve problem in academic research. A paper with a striking new finding is much more likely to be accepted at a top journal than a paper that says, \"I investigated an interesting hypothesis, but it turned out to be wrong.\" This means that spurious findings — statistical coincidences and such — make it into the published literature, while boring null results don’t. This gives a distorted picture of reality simply because everyone is trying to be interesting.\nSimilarly, the AP’s basic reporting project here seems like it was worth a shot and probably also fairly time-consuming. But it did not come up with anything. Clinton tried to help a Nobel Prize winner. She went to the Kennedy Center Honors. She had a meeting with the head of the charitable arm of MAC Cosmetics about a State Department charitable initiative.\nThere’s just nothing here. That’s the story. Braun and Sullivan looked into it, and as best they can tell, she’s clean.\nUnfortunately, there’s a financial incentive to lean in the other direction. NBC News found that one major Clinton Foundation donor was a for-profit college whose interests Hillary Clinton has utterly failed to champion, so NBC turned it into a hypocrisy story.\nHillary Clinton has been vocal critic of for-profit colleges, but Bill Clinton took in $17.6M from one over 5 years. https://t.co/1Ntbizsclf\nThe real news here ought to be just the opposite: Donors to the Clinton Foundation may believe they are buying Hillary Clinton’s political allegiance, but the reality is that they are not. I wouldn’t be surprised if there is someone, somewhere whom Clinton met with whom she wouldn’t have met with had that person not been a Clinton donor of some kind. But what we know is that despite very intensive media scrutiny of the Clinton Foundation, we don’t have hard evidence of any kind of corrupt activity.

            "report_content": "Submit\nThanks for contacting us. We've received your submission.\nMore than half the private citizens who got face time or spoke with Hillary Clinton while she was secretary of state forked over bundles of cash to the Clinton Foundation, a stunning new investigation revealed Tuesday.\nAt least 85 of the 154 nongovernment fat cats who got access to Clinton donated to her family charity or promised to back its programs, either personally or through businesses or other groups, according to a review of State Department documents by The Associated Press.\nCombined, the donors shelled out as much as $156 million, with at least 40 donating more than $100,000 each and 20 shelling out more than $1 million — more evidence that the family’s foundation doubled as a pay-for-play operation for those seeking access to Clinton, critics charge.\nDonors granted time with Clinton included:\nAnalysts said the revelations offer further proof that State under Clinton was rife with conflicts of interest because of its deep ties to the foundation.\n“The real conflicts of interest and appearances of conflicts are legion. This is proof positive the foundation should be shut if Clinton is elected president,” Larry Sabato, a University of Virginia political scientist, told The Post.\nDonald Trump’s campaign pounced on the revelations as further evidence of the Democratic nominee’s shoddy ethics.\n“The fact Hillary Clinton’s official schedule was full of meetings with Clinton Foundation donors is further evidence of the pay-to-play politics at her State Department” said Mike Pence, Trump’s running mate.\nCall logs show that Slim-Fast billionaire S. Daniel Abraham, a Clinton fund-raising bundler and foundation donor, was listed in Clinton’s date books for eight meetings with her at various times.\nMuhammad Yunus, a Bangladeshi economist who won the 2006 Nobel Peace Prize for pioneering low-interest micro-credit for poor business owners, met with Clinton three times and spoke with her by phone during a period when the Bangladeshi government was investigating his oversight of a nonprofit bank.\nHe ultimately was pressured to resign from the bank’s board.\nThroughout the process, he pleaded for help in messages routed to Clinton, who ordered aides to find ways to assist him.\nAnd after his meetings with Clinton, she warned the Bangladeshi government in a speech that “we do not want to see any action taken that would in any way undermine or interfere in the operations of the Grameen Bank,” though the warning went unheeded.\nIn another case, Clinton was host at a September 2009 breakfast meeting at the New York Stock Exchange that listed Blackstone Group chairman Stephen Schwarzman — a mega foundation donor — as one of the attendees.\nA day after the breakfast, according to Clinton e-mails, the State Department was working on a visa issue at Schwarzman’s request.\nBlackstone donated between $250,000 and $500,000 to the Clinton Foundation, and eight Blackstone executives also gave between $375,000 and $800,000. And\nBlackstone’s charitable arm has pledged millions of dollars in commitments to three Clinton Global Initiative projects.\nBlackstone officials did not make Schwarzman available for comment.\nClinton also met in June 2011 with Nancy Mahon of MAC AIDS, the charitable arm of MAC Cosmetics, which is owned by Estee Lauder.\nThe meeting occurred before an announcement about a State Department partnership to raise money to finance AIDS education and prevention.\nThe public-private partnership was formed to fight gender-based violence in South Africa, State said at the time.\nThe MAC AIDS fund donated between $5 million and $10 million to the Clinton Foundation.\nEstee Lauder executive Fabrizio Freda also met with Clinton at the same Wall Street event attended by Schwarzman.\nLater that month, Freda was on a list of attendees for a meeting between Clinton and a US-China trade group.\nEstee Lauder has given between $100,000 and $250,000 to the Clinton Foundation.\nState Department spokeswoman Elizabeth Trudeau said the agency was not aware of any actions that were influenced by the Clinton Foundation.\nThe 154 individuals who met or spoke to Clinton did not include federal employees or foreign government representatives.\nThe AP sought Clinton’s calendar and schedules three years ago, but the department stonewalled so the wire service had to sue in federal court to get access to those materials and other records.\nIn another disclosure, Fox News reported that a senior executive at the foundation left almost 150 telephone messages over two years for Cheryl Mills,\nClinton’s top aide at the State Department.\nA review of Mills’ call logs shows at least 148 messages from Laura Graham, who was the Clinton Foundation’s chief operating officer, between 2010 and 2012.\nNo other individual or nonprofit appears in the logs with anything approaching that frequency or volume, according to the review of the documents, which were released to the conservative advocacy group Citizens United as part of a long-running lawsuit over a Freedom of Information Act request.\nWith Post Wire Services\nShare Selection",

            "report_content": "During Hillary Clinton's tenure as Secretary of State, a number of individuals, organizations, and countries allegedly contributed to the Clinton Foundation either before, or while, pursuing interests through ordinary channels with the U.S. State Department.[1][2]\nJudicial Watch, a plaintiff in ongoing lawsuits pertaining to Clinton, alleged that email communications, obtained via FOIA requests, between officials at the Clinton Foundation and top aides of Secretary of State Clinton show improper ties between the Clinton Foundation and the State Department.[3][4][5] Clinton denied these allegations.[6] A Clinton spokesperson and others dismissed the controversy as election-year politics.[citation needed]\nBeginning in 2015, multiple investigations were conducted into alleged wrongdoing by the Foundation, including a two-year inquiry initiated by the Trump Justice Department, but through 2019 no evidence of wrongdoing was found.[7]\nThe Clinton Foundation, founded in 1997 by former US President Bill Clinton[8] is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization that describes its mission as  to \"strengthen the capacity of people in the United States and throughout the world to meet the challenges of global interdependence.\"[9]\nCharity watchdog group Charity Navigator, which has an ongoing relationship with the Foundation, gave it its highest possible rating, four out of four stars, after its customary review of the Foundation's financial records and tax statements.[10]\nIn January 2009, when then Senator and former First Lady Hillary Clinton appeared before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee as a nominee for Secretary of State for the Obama administration, Senator Richard Lugar (the senior Republican on the committee) said that the Foundation was “a unique complication that would have to be managed with great care and transparency.”[11]\nLugar said that the foundation could create the impression that foreign donors were giving money to gain access at the State Department: \"The core of the problem is that foreign governments and entities may perceive the Clinton Foundation as a means to gain favor with the Secretary of State\".[12]\nBefore her confirmation as Secretary of State, Clinton approved a memorandum of understanding (MOU) between the Foundation and the administration. The agreement permitted donations from governments who had contributed to the Foundation in the past, but prohibited contributions from governments that had not previously donated unless they were approved by the State Department's ethics office.[2][13][14] The memorandum was intended to ensure that foreign governments would not view contributions to the Foundation as a means to curry favor with the US State Department.[12] The MOU promised that the foundation would publish all contributors' names, and would seek prior approval from the State Department ethics office for new foreign donors.[12]\nA top donor to the foundation, Raj Fernando, was placed on the International Security Advisory Board within the State Department.  A piece in the Atlantic, referring to an ABC News story, described Fernando as being \"significantly less qualified\" than other members of that Board. The request for his appointment came from Secretary Clinton's office, and Fernando resigned shortly after ABC News made inquiries about it.[15]\nDennis Cheng had served as the chief development officer of the Clinton Foundation from 2011 to 2015, when he became the national finance director of Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign.[16]\nIn February 2015, The Washington Post reported that during Clinton's tenure as Secretary of State, the Clinton Foundation accepted several million dollars in donations from seven foreign governments, in compliance with the MOU it had signed with the State Department. One donation of $500,000  from Algeria to the Clinton Foundation's Haiti relief fund was found to have not been vetted by the State Department, in violation of Clinton's agreement with the administration. The Post noted that the donation \"coincided with a spike\" in lobbying efforts by Algeria of the State Department regarding their human rights record.[17][18]\nFrom 2009–13, the Russian atomic energy agency (Rosatom) acquired Uranium One, a Canadian company with global uranium mining stakes including 20% of the uranium production capacity in the United States. Since uranium is considered a strategic asset with national security implications, the acquisition was analyzed by a committee of nine government agencies, including the State Department, which was then headed by Clinton.[19][1][20] The voting members of the committee can object to such a foreign transaction, but the final decision then rests with the president.[21]\nIn April 2015, The New York Times reported that, during the acquisition, the family foundation of Uranium One's chairman made $2.35 million in donations to the Clinton Foundation. The donations which were legal were not publicly disclosed by the Clintons, despite a prior agreement to do so. In addition, a Russian investment bank with ties to the Kremlin and which was promoting Uranium One stock paid Bill Clinton $500,000 for a speech in Moscow shortly after the acquisition was announced.[1][20]\nNumerous Republican figures, including President Trump, have accused Hillary Clinton of wrong-doing related to Uranium One.[22] Trump said, \"Hillary Clinton gave them 20 percent of our uranium, gave Russia, for a big payment.\"[22] According to the Los Angeles Times, \"independent analysts said the facts did not support Trump’s assertion of scandal.\"[23] FactCheck.org reported that there was \"no evidence\" connecting the bribery allegations investigated by the Select Committee with the Uranium One–Rosatom merger deal.[24] In October 2017, the Washington Post fact-checker said that the fatal flaw in the accusations levied against Clinton is that she \"by all accounts, did not participate in any discussions regarding the Uranium One sale which — as we noted — does not actually result in the removal of uranium from the United States.\"[25] PBS mirrored the assessments by FactCheck.org and The Washington Post, noting that no uranium left the country, there is nothing to indicate Clinton was personally involved in the Uranium One sale, and that the State Department was one out of nine agencies that had to unanimously approve the Uranium One sale.[22] In 2015, the spokesman for the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission said that \"no Uranium One, Inc.-produced uranium has been shipped directly to Russia and the U.S. Government has not authorized any country to re-transfer U.S. uranium to Russia\"; in 2017, the spokesman said that the statement was still true.[24] This claim contradicts statements made by the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission spokesman in 2015 who confirmed yellowcake had been shipped to Canada, and a spokeswoman for Uranium One who said \"25 percent had gone to Western Europe and Japan.\"[1]\nOn October 25, 2017 the FBI removed the \"gag order\" on their informant related to the Uranium One deal controversy. As the informant lawyer, Victoria Toensing, stated that the informant \"work uncovering the Russian nuclear bribery case and the efforts he witnessed by Moscow to gain influence with the Clintons in hopes of winning favorable uranium decisions from the Obama administration\".[26][27] During a C-SPAN interview, Clinton denied being bribed to approve the deal, and that all such allegations had been \"debunked repeatedly\".[28] During an interview on Lou Dobbs Tonight, Toensing was ask about what she may have learned from the informant, she claimed that \"It’s quite significant\", the informant “can tell what all the Russians were talking about during the time that all these bribery payments were made”.[29]\nOn November 16, 2017, during an exclusive interview with Reuters, the FBI secret informant William Douglas Campbell (former lobbyist for Tenex, the US-based arm of Rosatom) decided to speak out publicly for the first time.[30][31] On March 8, 2018 The Hill reported, \"A confidential informant [Campbell] billed by House Republicans as having “explosive” information about the 2010 Uranium One deal approved during Hillary Clinton's tenure as secretary of State provided “no evidence of a quid pro quo” involving Clinton, Democratic staff said in a summary of the informant's closed-door testimony obtained by The Hill on Thursday.\"[32] CNN reported that the summary document also stated that the Justice Department had expressed concerns about Campbell's credibility due to \"inconsistencies between Campbell's statements and documents\" in an investigation into Tenex in 2015.[33]\nWhen Clinton took office as Secretary of State, the Internal Revenue Service was suing Switzerland's largest bank, UBS AG, to obtain information on Americans with secret accounts at the bank.  The bank's situation was complicated by the fact that, by acceding to the IRS's requests, the bank would potentially violate Switzerland's secrecy laws.  Following what The Wall Street Journal referred to as \"an unusual intervention by the top U.S. diplomat\", Clinton announced a tentative settlement between UBS and the IRS.  Based on the terms of the settlement, UBS provided information on the identities of 4,450 Americans with accounts at the bank out of a total of 52,000 requested by the IRS. The agreement was criticized by some lawmakers in the U.S. who had been seeking additional information.[34][35]\nFollowing the settlement in 2009, UBS's donations to the Clinton Foundation increased significantly.  Through 2008, the bank had donated $60,000 cumulatively to the Foundation.  By 2014, the total had grown to $600,000.  The bank also paid Bill Clinton $1.5 million for a series of question-and-answer sessions with its CEO, which was the top source of corporate speech income for Clinton between 2001 and 2014.[34][35]\nA number of emails released by Judicial Watch in August 2016 from Clinton's tenure as Secretary of State included dialogue between Doug Band, an official at the Clinton Foundation and personal aide to Bill Clinton, and top aides of Hillary Clinton. In one exchange in April 2009, Band lobbied for a job at the State Department on behalf of someone else saying it was \"important to take care of (redacted).\" Clinton's aide, Huma Abedin, responded \"Personnel has been sending him options\".[3][4]\nIn June 2009, Band emailed Abedin requesting a meeting with Clinton for Crown Prince Salman of Bahrain, the heir apparent and First Deputy Prime Minister. Band referred to the Prince as “a good friend of ours.”  In 2005, the Prince had committed to contribute $32 million to scholarships through the Clinton Global Initiative. Abedin responded, offering the Prince a meeting, noting \"We have reached out thru official channels.\"[34][36]\nIn December 2010, Band and Abedin exchanged emails regarding efforts to obtain invitations to an official lunch with Chinese President Hu Jintao for Clinton Foundation donors. The potential guests who were discussed included Bob McCann, then-president of wealth management at UBS, Judith Rodin, Rockefeller Foundation president, and Hikmet Ersek, Western Union CEO. Band requested that Rodin be seated at the same table as Vice President Joe Biden.[37][38]\nAccording to CNN, the emails \"raise questions about the Clinton Foundation's influence on the State Department and its relations during her tenure\". The Clinton campaign denied that the State Department took any actions based on contributions to the Clinton Foundation.[34][3][4]\nThe Clinton Foundation has been praised as a force for good and condemned as a \"slush fund\".[39]  The fact-checking organization Politifact says it is mostly true that the Clintons do not take from the foundation any salary, any other money, nor benefit personally.[40] Supporters of the Clintons say that the controversy obscures valuable work done by the foundation.[41] while others assert that the foundation made it possible for donors to gain access to Secretary Clinton, and influence her official actions.[39]\nIn 2016, the Associated Press published a controversial story based on logs of meetings Clinton took as Secretary of State. In the story, the AP stated that at least 85 of 154 people from private interests that Clinton met or had phone conversations with while Secretary of State donated to the Clinton Foundation. In total, the 85 donors contributed as much as $156 million to the Foundation. The AP described the number as an \"extraordinary proportion indicating her possible ethics challenges if elected president\". The AP promoted its story with a tweet claiming that \"more than half those who met Clinton as Cabinet secretary gave money to Clinton Foundation\", which has been criticized because it does not make clear that the analysis was performed on meetings with people who were not federal employees or foreign government representatives among other reasons.[42]\nBy excluding Clinton's meetings with government officials from the U.S. and other countries, the majority of her diplomatic work, the AP's count included only a small subcategory of fewer than 5% of the people Clinton met with as secretary of state.[42] The AP, explaining the omission, said that \"such meetings would presumably have been part of her diplomatic duties\".[43] Further, among the private donors with whom Clinton met were internationally known individuals such as Melinda Gates, Elie Wiesel, and Muhammad Yunus.[42]\nReporters from other news outlets immediately noticed, and commented on, the AP's selective use of information and misleading tweet.[44][45] The report was called a \"big failure\" in an opinion piece by Paul Reyes of CNN, because it presented \"facts out of context and somehow built a whole report around Clinton having done nothing wrong\".[46] A piece in the Washington Monthly stated that AP \"took some interesting information they gathered and spun it into something it wasn’t…scandalous.\"[47] Others described the story as botched or \"seriously flawed\".[48] Matthew Yglesias wrote that the AP story's conclusions \"turned out not to be true\".[49] A Clinton spokesman said of the story, “It cherry-picked a limited subset of Secretary Clinton's schedule to give a distorted portrayal of how often she crossed paths with individuals connected to charitable donations to the Clinton Foundation.”[34] Despite criticism from other journalists, and calls from Clinton and others for the AP to retract its tweet, the AP defended its story,[48] \" although its Executive Editor did admit that its tweet had been \"sloppy\".[50]\nDespite the MOU between the Clinton Foundation and the Obama Administration, the foundation's Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI) failed to report donors from 2009 to 2013, though later sought to rectify that omission.[12] A CHAI spokeswoman blamed this omission on oversight.[51]\nAccording to PolitiFact, the Clinton Foundation was allowed to accept millions of dollars from Australia, Dominican Republic, Kuwait, Norway, Qatar and Oman because of the clause in the MOU which allows previous donors to continue to fund the foundation's programs.[52] Conservative columnist Jennifer Rubin opined that the Qatari donation raised ethical questions because Qatar is \"a prominent backer of Hamas.\"[53] Without notifying the State Department, the Clinton Foundation accepted donations from Algeria, which donated for the first time in 2010, and from the United Kingdom, which tripled its support of the foundation's health programs between 2009 and 2012. Foundation officials blamed the case of Algeria on a lack of oversight and argued that the UK donation did not constitute \"material increase\" in support for the foundation.[54]\nCharity Watch, a nonprofit charity watchdog organization, has given the Clinton Foundation an \"A rating\" overall, higher than the American Red Cross, and the \"highest rated\" grade for \"Transparency and Governance\".[55][56] The charity watchdog group Charity Navigator gave the Clinton Foundation its highest possible rating, four out of four stars, after reviewing its financial records and tax statements.[57]\nDemocratic Senator Bernie Sanders, during his unsuccessful presidential campaign, criticized Clinton for a conflict of interest: \"Do I have a problem when a sitting secretary of State and a foundation run by her husband collects many, many dollars from foreign governments — governments which are dictatorships? Yeah, I do have a problem with that. Yeah, I do\".[58] Republican Senator John Cornyn, who voted for Clinton's confirmation in 2009, says that she duped Congress, that he now regrets his vote, and that President Obama should appoint a special prosecutor to investigate whether donors to the foundation gained improper access at the State Department.[12]\nAn August 30, 2016 editorial by The New York Times opined there was no proof that donors to the foundation received special favors from Hillary Clinton when she was Secretary of State.[59] However, the Times added that there was reason to question where the Clinton Foundation ended and where the State Department began.[59]\nIn October 2016, The Wall Street Journal reported that four field offices of the Federal Bureau of Investigation—in New York, Los Angeles, Washington, and Little Rock, Ark. -- had been collecting information about the Clinton Foundation to determine whether \"there was evidence of financial crimes or influence-peddling.\" According to the WSJ article, FBI officials presented their findings to the Justice Department in February 2016, but \"the meeting didn't go well\". Justice Department officials felt the cases were weak and saw little reason to continue the investigations.[60] However, the New York FBI field office continued to pursue the matter, leading to reports that some New York agents were feuding with the Justice Department and basing their investigation in part on media accounts[61] and in particular on the book Clinton Cash, written by Peter Schweizer, a senior editor-at-large for Breitbart News.[62] In a reported separate investigation, the Washington field office had been investigating Terry McAuliffe[when?] before he became a board member of the Clinton Foundation.[60]\nThe Washington Post reported in January 2020 that an additional Justice Department investigation into the matter, initiated after Donald Trump took office in 2017, was winding down after finding nothing worth pursuing.[7]",

            "report_content": "The Clinton Foundation (founded in 1997 as the William J. Clinton Presidential Foundation,[7] and renamed in 2013 as the Bill, Hillary & Chelsea Clinton Foundation)[8] is a nonprofit organization under section 501(c)(3) of the U.S. tax code. It was established by former president of the United States Bill Clinton with the stated mission to \"strengthen the capacity of people in the United States and throughout the world to meet the challenges of global interdependence.\"[9] Its offices are located in New York City and Little Rock, Arkansas.\nThrough 2016, the foundation had raised an estimated $2 billion from U.S. corporations, foreign governments and corporations, political donors, and various other groups and individuals.[10] The acceptance of funds from wealthy donors has been a source of controversy.[10][11] The foundation \"has won accolades from philanthropy experts and has drawn bipartisan support\".[10] Charitable grants are not a major focus of the Clinton Foundation, which instead uses most of its money to carry out its own humanitarian programs.[12]\nThis foundation is a public organization to which anyone may donate and is distinct from the Clinton Family Foundation, a private organization for personal Clinton family philanthropy.[13][14]\nAccording to the Clinton Foundation's website, neither Bill Clinton nor his daughter, Chelsea Clinton (both are members of the governing board), draws any salary or receives any income from the foundation. When Hillary Clinton was a board member, she reportedly also received no income from the foundation.[15]\nBeginning in 2015, the foundation was accused of wrongdoing, including a bribery and pay-to-play scheme, but multiple investigations through 2019 found no evidence of malfeasance. The New York Times reported in September 2020 that a federal prosecutor appointed by attorney general Bill Barr to investigate the origins of the 2016 FBI Crossfire Hurricane investigation had also sought documents and interviews regarding how the FBI handled an investigation into the Clinton Foundation.[16]\nThe origins of the foundation go back to 1997, when then-president Bill Clinton was focused mostly on fundraising for the future Clinton Presidential Center in Little Rock, Arkansas.[3] He founded the William J. Clinton Foundation in 2001 following the completion of his presidency.[17] Longtime Clinton advisor Bruce Lindsey became the CEO in 2004.[18][19] Later, Lindsey moved from being CEO to being chair, largely for health reasons.[18] Other Clinton hands who played an important early role included Doug Band[20] and Ira Magaziner. Additional Clinton associates who have had senior positions at the foundation include John Podesta and Laura Graham.[17]\nThe foundation's success is spurred by Bill Clinton's worldwide fame and his ability to bring together corporate executives, celebrities, and government officials.[17] Similarly, the foundation areas of involvement have often corresponded to whatever Bill suddenly felt an interest in.[17]\nPreceding Barack Obama's 2009 nomination of Hillary Clinton as United States Secretary of State, Bill Clinton agreed to accept a number of conditions and restrictions regarding his ongoing activities and fundraising efforts for the Clinton Presidential Center and the Clinton Global Initiative.[21] Accordingly, a list of donors was released in December 2008.[22]\nBy 2011, Chelsea Clinton was taking a dominant role in the foundation and had a seat on its board.[17][23] To raise money for the foundation, she gave paid speeches, such as her $65,000 2014 address at the University of Missouri in Kansas City for the opening of the Starr Women's Hall of Fame.[24]\nIn 2013, Hillary Clinton joined the foundation following her tenure as Secretary of State. She planned to focus her work on issues regarding women and children,[25][26] as well as economic development.[18] Accordingly, at that point, it was renamed the \"Bill, Hillary & Chelsea Clinton Foundation\".[17]  Extra attention was paid to the foundation due to the 2016 United States presidential election.[17][18]\nIn July 2013, Eric Braverman was named CEO of the foundation.[19] He is a friend and former colleague of Chelsea Clinton from McKinsey & Company.[17][18]  At the same time, Chelsea Clinton was named vice chair of the foundation's board.[17][19]  The foundation was also in the midst of a move to two floors of the Time-Life Building in Midtown Manhattan.[17]\nChelsea Clinton moved the organization to an outside review, conducted by the firm of Simpson Thacher & Bartlett. Its conclusions were made public in mid-2013.[18] The main focus was to determine how the foundation could achieve firm financial footing that was not dependent upon the former president's fundraising abilities, how it could operate more like a permanent entity rather than a start-up organization, and thus how it could survive and prosper beyond Bill Clinton's lifetime.[17][18] Dennis Cheng, a former Hillary Clinton campaign official and State Department deputy chief, was named to oversee a $250 million endowment drive.[17] The review also found the management and structure of the foundation needed improvements, including an increase in the size of its board of directors that would have a more direct involvement in planning and budget activities.[18] Additionally, the review said that all employees needed to understand the foundation's conflict of interest policies and that expense reports needed a more formal review process.[18]\nIn January 2015, Braverman announced his resignation. Politico attributed the move to being \"partly from a power struggle inside the foundation between and among the coterie of Clinton loyalists who have surrounded the former president for decades and who helped start and run the foundation.\"[27] He was succeeded at first in an acting capacity by former deputy assistant secretary, Maura Pally.[28]\nOn February 18, 2015, The Washington Post reported that, \"the foundation has won accolades from philanthropy experts and has drawn bipartisan support, with members of the George W. Bush administration often participating in its programs.\"[10] In March 2015, former Secretary of Health and Human Services in the Clinton administration, Donna Shalala, was selected to run the Clinton Foundation.[29] She left in April 2017.[30]\nIn August 2016, The Boston Globe's editorial board suggested that the Clinton Foundation cease accepting donations. The Globe's editorial board offered praise for the foundation's work but added that \"as long as either of the Clintons are in public office, or actively seeking it, they should not operate a charity, too\" because it represents a conflict of interest and a political distraction.[31]\nIn 2016, Reuters reported that the Clinton Foundation suspected that it had been the target of a cyber security breach. As a consequence of the suspected cyber security breach, Clinton Foundation officials retained a security firm, FireEye, to evaluate its data systems. The cyber security breach has been described as sharing similarities with cyberattacks that targeted other institutions, such as the Democratic National Committee.[32]\nIn October 2016, The Wall Street Journal reported that four FBI field offices—in New York, Los Angeles, Washington, and Little Rock—had been collecting information about the Clinton Foundation to determine whether \"there was evidence of financial crimes or influence-peddling\". In a reported separate investigation, the Washington field office was investigating Terry McAuliffe before he became a board member of the Clinton Foundation.[33] CNN reported in January 2018 that the FBI is investigating allegations of corruption at the Clinton Foundation in Arkansas. Sources said that federal prosecutors are checking to see if foundation donors were improperly promised policy favors or special access to Hillary Clinton during her tenure as secretary of state in return for donations and whether tax-exempt funds were misused by the foundation's leadership.[34]\nThe Washington Post reported in January 2020 that an additional Justice Department investigation into the matter, initiated after Donald Trump took office in 2017, was winding down after finding nothing worth pursuing.[35]\nAs of January 2018, the board members are:[36]\nAs of January 1, 2010, the Clinton HIV/AIDS Initiative, an initiative of the Clinton Foundation, became a separate nonprofit organization called the Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI).[17][37] Organizations such as the Clinton Foundation continue to supply anti-malarial drugs to Africa and other affected areas; according to director Inder Singh, in 2011 more than 12 million individuals will be supplied with subsidized anti-malarial drugs.[citation needed]\nIn May 2007, CHAI and UNITAID announced agreements that help middle-income and low-income countries save money on second-line drugs. The partnership also reduced the price of a once-daily first-line treatment to less than $1 per day.[38]\nCHAI was spun off into a separate organization in 2010; Ira Magaziner became its CEO (he had been a key figure in the Clinton health care plan of 1993).[17] Chelsea Clinton joined its board in 2011, as did Tachi Yamada, former President of the Global Health Program at the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.[17]\nThe Clinton Global Initiative (CGI) was founded in 2005 by Bill Clinton. Doug Band, counselor to Bill, was integral to its formation.[20] Clinton has credited Band with being the originator of CGI and has noted that \"Doug had the idea to do this.\"[39] Band left his paid position at CGI in 2010,[17] preferring to emphasize his Teneo business and family pursuits, but remains on the CGI advisory board.[18] The overlap between CGI and Teneo, of which Bill was a paid advisor, drew criticism.[17] According to his attorneys during 2007 plea negotiations on sex offense charges, financier Jeffrey Epstein also formed \"part of the original group that conceived the Clinton Global Initiative\", though his name was not mentioned in any of the organization's founding documents.[40][41]\nIn 2007, Bill started CGI U, which expanded the model of CGI to students, universities, and national youth organizations. CGI U has been held at Tulane University, the University of Texas at Austin, the University of Miami, the University of California, San Diego, The George Washington University, Washington University in St. Louis, Arizona State University, and University of California, Berkeley. Panelists and speakers have included Jon Stewart, Madeleine Albright, Vandana Shiva, Bill and Chelsea Clinton, Stephen Colbert, Jack Dorsey, Greg Stanton, U.S. Rep. Gabby Giffords, Shane Battier, Salman Khan (founder of Khan Academy), and U.S. Rep. John Lewis.[42][43][44][45][46]\nIn September 2016, it was announced that the Initiative would be winding down to be discontinued and that 74 employees would be let go at the end of the year.[47][48] In January 2017, it was announced that another 22 employees would be let go by April 15, 2017, and that CGI University would be continued.[49][50]\nThe Clinton Global Citizen Awards are a set of awards which have been given by the Clinton Global Initiative every year since 2007.[51] The awards are given to individuals who, in the opinion of the Clinton Foundation, are \"outstanding individuals who exemplify global citizenship through their vision and leadership\".[51] Past recipients of the award include Mexican businessman and philanthropist Carlos Slim,[51] Irish billionaire Denis O'Brien,[52] Moroccan entrepreneur Mohammad Abbad Andaloussi,[53] Rwandan President Paul Kagame,[54] Afghan women's rights activist Suraya Pakzad,[55] Dominican Republic President Leonel Fernández,[56] and Pakistani labor rights activist Syeda Ghulam Fatima.[57]\nIn August 2006, Bill Clinton started a program to fight climate change, the Clinton Foundation's Climate Initiative (CCI).[58]  The CCI directly runs various programs to prevent deforestation and to rehabilitate forests and other landscapes worldwide, develop clean energy, and help island nations threatened by rising ocean levels.[59]\nOn August 1, 2006, the foundation entered into a partnership with the Large Cities Climate Leadership Group, agreeing to provide resources to allow the participating cities to enter into an energy-saving product purchasing consortium and to provide technical and communications support.[60]\nIn May 2007, CCI announced its first project which will help some large cities cut greenhouse gas emissions by facilitating retrofitting of existing buildings. Five large banks committed $1 billion each to help cities and building owners make energy-saving improvements aimed at lowering energy use and energy costs.[61]  At the 2007 Clinton Global Initiative, Bill Clinton announced the 1Sky campaign to accelerate bold federal policy on global warming.[62] The 1Sky campaign supports at least an 80% reduction in climate pollution levels by 2050.\nOn May 19, 2009, CCI announced the global Climate Positive Development Program where it will work with the U.S. Green Building Council to promote \"climate positive\" city growth.[63]\nNorway and Germany are among the countries co-financing projects with the CCI in numerous developing and third-world countries.[64][65][66]\nThe Clinton Development Initiative, originally the Clinton Hunter Development Initiative, was formed in 2006 as a partnership with Scottish philanthropist Sir Tom Hunter's Hunter Foundation to target the root causes of poverty in Africa and promote sustainable economic growth.[67]\nThe Alliance for a Healthier Generation is a partnership between the Clinton Foundation and the American Heart Association that was working to end the childhood obesity epidemic in the United States by 2010.\nThe Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, which provided an initial $8 million to start the Healthy Schools Program, awarded a $20 million grant to expand the program to over 8,000 schools in states with the highest obesity rates.[68]\nAt the industry level, the Alliance struck agreements with major food and beverage manufacturers to provide kids with nutritional options, and established nutrition guidelines for school vending machines, stores and cafeterias to promote healthy eating.  Some of the companies involved in these efforts are Coca-Cola, Cadbury plc, Campbell Soup Company, Groupe Danone, Kraft Foods, Mars and PepsiCo.[69][70]\nEstablished in 2007 with Canadian mining executive Frank Giustra — founder of the petroleum company Pacific Rubiales (renamed Pacific Exploration & Production in 2015) — CGSGI describes itself as \"pioneering an innovative approach to poverty alleviation.\"[71] Giustra's involvement with the Clinton Foundation has been criticized by the International Business Times, The Washington Post, and the American Media Institute because it was accompanied by a sudden reversal in Hillary Clinton's position while Secretary of State concerning the United States–Colombia Free Trade Agreement, an agreement which she had previously opposed \"as bad for labor rights.\"[72][73][74][75]\nIn November 2012, Bill Clinton announced the launch of the Clinton Health Matters Initiative (CHMI). CHMI is a national initiative, building on the Clinton Foundation's work on global health and childhood obesity, that works to improve the health and well-being of people across the United States by activating individuals, communities, and organizations to make meaningful contributions to the health of others. CHMI holds an annual Health Matters conference every January in the Coachella Valley.[76]\nThe foundation has funded extensive disaster relief programs following the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and Hurricane Katrina in 2005. Shortly after Hurricane Katrina hit, President George W. Bush asked former Presidents George H. W. Bush and Bill Clinton to raise funds to help rebuild the Gulf Coast region. The two Presidents, having worked together to assist victims of the Indian Ocean tsunami, established the Bush-Clinton Katrina Fund to identify and meet the unmet needs in the region, foster economic opportunity, and to improve the quality of life of those affected.[77] In the first month after the hurricane, the Fund collected over 42,000 online donations alone; approximately $128.4 million has been received to date from all 50 states and $30.9 million from foreign countries.\nBoth the foundation and the Clintons personally have been involved in Haiti before and after the 2010 Haiti earthquake.[17][78] Bill Clinton was named the head of the Interim Haiti Recovery Commission (IHRC) in 2010 after serving as UN special envoy to Haiti in the immediate aftermath of the disaster. The Clinton Foundation itself raised $30m and played an important part in the creation of the Caracol Industrial Park.  The IHRC mandate was removed by the Haitian legislature in 2011.[79]\nIn 2013, Hillary Clinton established a partnership between the foundation and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to gather and study data on the progress of women and girls around the world since the United Nations Fourth World Conference On Women in Beijing in 1995.[80][81] This is called \"No Ceilings: The Full Participation Project\".[80][81] The project released a report in March 2015.[82]\nThe Clinton Foundation relies on donation from various groups or individuals, donors such as Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation donated over $25 million over the years[83] Throughout the years, donations have been varying from one year to the other according to their financial reports [84]\nIn March 2015, the charity watchdog group Charity Navigator added the Clinton Foundation to a watch list (a designation meant to warn donors that questions have been raised about an entity's practices), after several news organizations raised questions over donations from corporations and foreign governments. It removed the foundation from its watch list in late December of that year.[85]  In September 2016, it gave it its highest possible rating, four out of four stars, after its customary review of the foundation's financial records and tax statements.[86]  A different charity monitor, CharityWatch, said that 88% of the foundation's money goes toward its charitable mission and gave the foundation an A rating for 2016. In 2015, based on revenue of $223 million and an expense ratio of 12% the foundation spent in excess of $26 million to complete its mission.[87]\nThe Clinton Foundation is a public organization to which anyone may donate.  Due to their similar names, the public foundation has sometimes been confused with the Clinton Family Foundation, which is reserved for the Clintons' private philanthropy.  The two foundations have sometimes been conflated by news sources.[13] The significantly smaller Clinton Family Foundation is a traditional private foundation that serves as the vehicle for their personal charitable giving.[14] Headquartered in Chappaqua, New York, it received nearly all of the approximately $14 million the Clintons gave to charity from 2007 to 2013.[13]\nAround 2007, the Clinton Foundation was criticized for a lack of transparency. Although U.S. law did not require charities, including presidential foundations, to disclose the identities of their contributors, critics said that the names of donors should be disclosed because Hillary Clinton was running to be the Democratic nominee for President of the United States. Commentator Matthew Yglesias opined in a Los Angeles Times op-ed that the Clintons should make public the names of foundation donors to avoid any appearance of impropriety.[88]\nA lengthy donors list was then released by the foundation in December 2008,[22] which included several politically sensitive donors, such as the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and Blackwater Worldwide.[89] The foundation stated that the disclosures would ensure that \"not even the appearance of a conflict of interest\" would exist once Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State.[89]\nThe foundation has been criticized for receiving donations from Middle-Eastern countries which are seen to oppress women (stoning for adultery, not being able to drive, requiring a male guardian, etc.). This particularly included Saudi Arabia, which donated between $10 million and $25 million. Apart from the Middle Eastern countries like the United Arab Emirates and Oman, other foreign government donations came from Australia, Germany, and a Canadian government agency.[90] [91]  The foundation accepted these donations even though Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign platform guaranteed to break down barriers that held women back.[92]\nIn November 2016, Reuters reported that \"The Clinton Foundation has confirmed it accepted a $1 million gift from Qatar while Hillary Clinton was U.S. Secretary of State without informing the State Department, even though she had promised to let the agency review new or significantly increased support from foreign governments.\"[93] Washington Post columnist Jennifer Rubin opined that the Qatari gift \"raised ethical questions\" because of the nation's support for Hamas.[94]\nThe ethics agreement between the State Department and the Clinton Foundation that had been put into force at the beginning of Hillary Clinton's tenure as Secretary of State in 2009 came under scrutiny from the news media during February 2015 as polls showed her the likely 2016 Democratic nominee for president.[95] The Wall Street Journal reported that the Clinton Foundation had resumed accepting donations from foreign governments once Secretary Clinton's tenure had ended.[96]  Contributions from foreign donors, which are prohibited by law from contributing to political candidates in the U.S., constitute a major portion of the foundation's income. An investigation by The Washington Post of 2014 donations showed that there was \"substantial overlap between the Clinton political machinery and the foundation\". The investigation revealed that almost half of the major donors who had backed Ready for Hillary, a group which supported her 2016 presidency bid, had given at least $10,000 to the foundation, either personally or through foundations or companies they run. The Clinton Foundation's chief communications officer Craig Minassian explained that it is a \"false choice to suggest that people who may be interested in supporting political causes wouldn't also support philanthropic work.\"[10]\nA subsequent The Washington Post inquiry into donations by foreign governments to the Clinton Foundation during the Secretary's tenure found, in addition to six cases where such governments continued making donations at the same level they had before Clinton became Secretary as envisioned under the agreement, one instance of a new donation, $500,000 from Algeria for earthquake relief in Haiti, that was outside the bounds of the continuation provision and should have received a special ethics review, but did not.[97] Foundation officials said that if the former Secretary decided to run for president in 2016, they would again consider what steps to take in reference to foreign donations.[97] But in general, they stressed that, \"As with other global charities, we rely on the support of individuals, organizations, corporations and governments who have the shared goal of addressing critical global challenges in a meaningful way. When anyone contributes to the Clinton Foundation, it goes towards foundation programs that help save lives.\"[97] State Department spokesperson Jen Psaki attested that the foundation's commitment to the ethics agreement in question \"has been over and above the letter of the law\".[98] In August 2016, after Clinton's securing the Democratic nomination, the Clinton Foundation announced that it will stop accepting foreign donations if she were elected.[99]\nIn March 2015, Reuters reported that the Clinton Health Access Initiative had failed to publish all of its donors, and to let the State Department review all of its donations from foreign governments after it was spun off from the Clinton Foundation in 2010.[100] In April 2015, The New York Times reported that when Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State, the State Department had approved transactions that allowed Russian state-owned corporation Rosatom to take a majority stake in Uranium One,[101] whose chairman had donated to the Clinton Foundation.[102] The State Department \"was one of nine government agencies, not to mention independent federal and state nuclear regulators, that had to sign off on the deal.\"[103] FactCheck.org decided there is \"no evidence\" that the donations influenced Clinton's official actions or that she was involved in the State Department's decision to approve the deal,[104] and PolitiFact concluded that any \"suggestion of a quid pro quo is unsubstantiated\".[103]\nIn February 2016, The Washington Post reported that the United States Department of State issued a subpoena to the foundation in the fall of 2015. According to the report, the subpoena focused on \"documents about the charity's projects that may have required approval from federal government during Hillary Clinton's term as secretary of state\" and \"also asked for records related to Huma Abedin, longtime Clinton aide who for six months in 2012 was employed simultaneously by the State Department, the foundation, Clinton's personal office, and a private consulting firm with ties to the Clintons.\"[105]\nDonations totalling tens of millions of dollars from successive Australian and New Zealand governments to the Clinton Foundation were the subject of criticism from a number of groups including the Taxpayers union of New Zealand[106] for a perceived lack of accountability and perceived conflicts of interest,[107][108][109] some of the donations were made directly and some through AUSAID.[110]\nIn 2006, the then foreign minister Alexander Downer and former President Clinton jointly signed a Memorandum of Understanding in February 2006 that gave more than A$25 million to the Clinton Foundation across four years for a project to provide screening and drug treatment to AIDS patients in Asia. The donation was later made through an affiliate of the charity known as the Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI).[citation needed] The Australian government ceased funding CHAI in 2016.[111] In 2017 the Specialist Health Service (SHS) in a report commissioned by DFAT noted \"Previously, there appears to have been an over-reliance on the Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI) for facilitating market access\".[112]\nIn 2011, a pledge of A$270 million was made by Australian Julia Gillard government to the Global Partnership for Education[113] which in 2014 joined the Clinton Global Initiative.[114] Julia Gillard was made a member of the board of Global Partnership for Education in 2014 after losing the Australian federal election[115][116]\nAccording to DFAT, Australia contributed A$340.8 million to the Global partnership for education between 2007 and 2014 [117] including A$90 million in replenishment between 2018 and 2020[118]\nA Department of foreign affairs and trade (DFAT) spokesperson[who?] responded to questions by News.com by stating: \"all funding is used \"solely for agreed development projects\" and Clinton charities have \"a proven track record\" in helping developing countries.[citation needed]\nAccording to the hacked Podesta emails, Doug Band, an employee of the Clinton Foundation, accused Chelsea Clinton's husband Marc Mezvinsky of being involved in conflicts of interest. According to Band, Mezvinsky used the foundation to raise money for his hedge fund.[119] Band also said that he could name 500 different conflicts of interest involving the foundation and some that involved Bill Clinton.[120]\nUsing the Former Presidents Act Bill Clinton used taxpayer funds to supplement the pay of aides at the Clinton foundation and also used funds for IT equipment. Clinton withdrew 16 million dollars using the president act which was more than any other living president had withdrawn.[121]\nIn 2011 Raj Fernando who gave between 100,000 and 250,000 to the Clinton foundation was appointed to the International Security Advisory Board within the State Department despite being unqualified. Fernando's appointment came at the request of Clinton Aide Cheryl Mills and Hillary Clinton. Fernando resigned from the position shortly after an inquiry was made by ABC.[122]\nIn 2009 foundation aide Doug Band emailed Huma Abedin requesting a meeting with Hillary Clinton for Salman bin Hamad Al Khalifa who had donated 32 million to the Clinton foundation.[123][124] 2 days later the meeting was arranged.[125]",

            "report_content": "Trending:\nIf there was a contest for least surprising headline of 2021, first prize would go to DailyCaller.com for this winner from last week: “Ethics Experts Alarmed by 93% Decrease in Clinton Foundation Donations Since $250 Million Peak in 2009.”\nIf you’re just tuning in to this program, already in progress, the Clinton Foundation is the 501 (c)(3) nonprofit organization that the former president set up in 2001 after he left office.\nClinton wrote in an online post at the time that the foundation was all about “creating opportunities and solving problems faster, better, at lower cost so that more people are empowered to build better futures for themselves, their families and their communities.”\nIn order to accomplish these goals, the Clinton Foundation accepted huge donations from foreign sources and, like other foundations, didn’t disclose its donors.\nHillary Clinton was sworn in as U.S. senator from New York about the same time the Clinton Foundation was set up. In 2002, the foundation raised $25.6 million. By 2004, it had raised more than $50 million. In 2006, as a White House run approached, the foundation raised nearly $150 million, and then in the presidential campaign year of 2008, nearly $200 million.\nBut then Mrs. Clinton lost the Democratic nomination to Sen. Barack Obama. Things looked bleak for her political career, and then two things happened, one that was very helpful for foundation fundraising and one that wasn’t helpful at all.\nThe helpful thing was President Obama’s decision to offer Mrs. Clinton the job of Secretary of State. The not-helpful thing was the ethics agreement on which the job offer was contingent. Both Clintons had to agree to new restrictions on their fundraising activities. New foreign donations were banned, the White House would have to approve all of President Clinton’s paid speeches, and the foundation would have to disclose its donors.\nThe Clintons’ representative signed the agreement, and that’s exactly when Hillary Clinton set up a private email server in her house that kept all her official State Department correspondence completely hidden from public records requests and official inquiries.\nIn 2009, with Mrs. Clinton as Secretary of State, a likely White House run in her future, and a secret email server hiding her communications, the Clinton Foundation took in $249 million.\nIn 2010, the Washington Post later reported, the Clinton Foundation violated the ethics agreement by secretly accepting $500,000 from the government of Algeria while that country was lobbying the state department over human rights issues. The foundation also accepted millions of dollars in continuing foreign donations, which were not prohibited by the ethics agreement, from countries that had what the Post characterized as “complicated diplomatic, military and financial relationships with the U.S. government.”\n“Rarely, if ever, has a potential commander in chief been so closely associated with an organization that has solicited financial support from foreign governments,” the Post intoned.\nThat report came out in 2015, along with a New York Times article investigating the 2013 purchase of a Canadian company, Uranium One, by Russia’s atomic energy agency, Rosatom. The Clinton Foundation received $2.35 million in donations from the family foundation of the chairman of Uranium One, and those donations were not publicly disclosed. Secretary Clinton sat on a committee that voted to approve the sale.\nReuters found out that from 2010 to 2013, the foundation wasn’t disclosing all of its donors and didn’t tell the State Department that Australia and the UK had doubled and tripled their contributions to the Clinton foundation while Mrs. Clinton was Secretary of State. The Associated Press discovered that more than half of Secretary Clinton’s meetings with people outside the government were with donors to the Clinton Foundation.\nIn 2016, FBI agents from four field offices opened preliminary inquiries into the Clinton Foundation’s dealings with donors. At that time, the Justice Department wouldn’t grant authorization for subpoenas or search warrants, but in 2018, the New York Times reported that the foundation was served with a grand jury subpoena for records and complied.\nIn September 2020, the New York Times reported that then-U.S. Attorney John Durham was investigating the FBI’s handling of the investigation into the Clinton Foundation.\nDurham was appointed a special counsel, authorized to investigate whether anyone “violated the law in connection with the intelligence, counter-intelligence, or law-enforcement activities directed at the 2016 presidential campaigns, individuals associated with those campaigns, and individuals associated with the administration of President Donald J. Trump,” and recently, Durham indicted two people for lying to the FBI. One was a Clinton campaign lawyer.\nProsecutors cited declassified CIA documents showing that then-CIA director John Brennan briefed President Obama in 2016 that Hillary Clinton had allegedly approved a plan to “vilify Donald Trump by stirring up a scandal claiming interference by the Russian security service” and that she had done this “as a means of distracting the public from her use of a private email server.”\n“Ethics experts,” the Daily Caller reported, are “alarmed” by the speedy decline of donations and say it shows “clear red flags of political corruption.”\nNow they tell us.\nWrite Susan Shelley at Susan@SusanShelley.com\nGet the latest news delivered daily!\nWe invite you to use our commenting platform to engage in insightful conversations about issues in our community.

Horowitz\nInspector General, U.S. Department of Justice\nbefore the\nU.S. House of Representatives\nCommittees on Over overnment Reform and\nthe Judiciary\nconcerning\n“Oversight of the FBI and DOJ Actions in Advance of the 2016 Election”\nChairmen, Ranking Members, and Members of the Committees:\nThank you for inviting me to testify at today’s hearing to examine the Office of the Inspector General’s (OIG) findings in our “Review of Various Actions by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and Department of Justice in Advance of the 2016 Election.” The report reviews various actions by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and Department of Justice (Department) in connection with the investigation into the use of a private email server by former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton (named the Midyear investigation by the FBI). The report can be found on the OIG’s website at the following link: https://www.justice.gov/file/1071991/download.\nThe 500-plus page report was the product of 17 months of investigative work by a dedicated OIG team that reviewed well over 1.2 million documents, including over 100,000 text and instant messages, and interviewed more than 100 witnesses, many on multiple occasions. Our report provides a thorough, comprehensive, and objective recitation of the facts related to the Department’s handling of the Midyear investigation. The review team followed the evidence wherever it led, and it was through their efforts that we identified the inappropriate text and instant messages discussed in the report. Additionally, as a result of the OIG’s painstaking forensic examinations, we recovered thousands of text messages that otherwise would have been lost or undisclosed. We completed our report when we were satisfied that we had pursued all reasonable investigative leads and finished our detailed forensic examinations. As a result of this approach, our report includes, for example, text messages that we recovered just last month, which were significant to our findings. It also includes an analysis of the FBI’s decision not to request access in May 2016 to certain classified information, a decision that we did not learn of until the later stages of our review.\nAs detailed in our report, we found that the inappropriate political messages cast a cloud over the Midyear investigation, sowed doubt about the credibility of the FBI’s handling of it, and impacted the reputation of the FBI. Moreover, we found the implication that senior FBI employees would be willing to take official action to impact a presidential candidate’s electoral prospects to be deeply troubling and antithetical to the core values of the FBI and the Department of Justice.\nOur review also included a fact-based, detailed assessment of certain specific investigative and prosecutorial decisions that were the subject of controversy. It was necessary to select particular investigative decisions for focused attention because it would not have been possible to recreate and analyze every decision made in a year-long investigation. In examining the decisions we selected for review, the question we considered was not whether a particular decision was the ideal or most effective choice, but rather, whether the documentary and testimonial evidence indicated that the decision was based on improper considerations, including political bias. This approach is consistent with the OIG’s handling of such questions in past reviews with respect to assessing discretionary judgment calls, and recognizes and respects the institutional oversight role of the OIG. Our report provides a comprehensive assessment of these decisions and of the Midyear investigation, and details the factual evidence, so that the public, Congress, and other stakeholders can conduct their own assessment of them.\nWithin this framework, as to the specific investigative and prosecutorial decisions we reviewed, we did not find documentary or testimonial evidence that improper considerations, including political bias, directly affected those specific investigative decisions, in part because the decisions were made by the larger Midyear team or the prosecutors. This determination by the OIG does not mean that we necessarily endorse the decisions or conclude they were the most effective among the options considered, or that our finding should or can be extrapolated to cover other decisions made during the course of the investigation by FBI employees who sent inappropriate political messages. With regard to the decision to close the investigation without prosecution, we found no evidence that the conclusions by the prosecutors were the result of improper considerations, including political bias, but rather were based on the prosecutors’ assessment of the facts, the law, and past Department practice.\nConversely, we found that the FBI’s explanations for its failure to take immediate action after discovering the Weiner laptop in October 2016 to be unpersuasive, and we did not have confidence that the decision of Deputy Assistant Director Peter Strzok to prioritize the Russia investigation over following up on the Weiner laptop was free from bias.\nWe also found that, in key moments, then FBI Director James Comey clearly departed from FBI and Department norms, and his decisions negatively impacted the perception of the FBI and the Department as fair administrators of justice.\nDirector Comey concealed from the Attorney General and the Deputy Attorney General his intention to make a unilateral announcement in July about the reasons for his recommendation not to prosecute former Secretary Clinton. His July 5 statement included inappropriate commentary about uncharged conduct, announced his views on what a “reasonable prosecutor” would do, and served to confuse rather than clarify public understanding of his recommendation. In late October, he again acted without adequately consulting Department leadership – and contrary to important Department norms – when he sent a letter to Congress announcing renewed investigative activity days before the election.\nThere are many lessons to be learned from the Department’s and the FBI’s handling of the Midyear investigation. But among the most important is the need to respect the institution’s hierarchy and structure, and to follow established policies, procedures, and norms even in the highest-profile and most challenging investigations. No rule, policy, or practice is perfect, of course. But at the same time, neither is any individual’s ability to make judgments under pressure or in what may seem like unique circumstances. When leaders and officials adhere to their bedrock principles and values, the public has greater confidence in the fairness and rightness of their decisions, and those institutions’ leaders better protect the interests of federal law enforcement and the dedicated professionals who serve us all. By contrast, the public’s trust is negatively impacted when law enforcement officials make statements reflecting bias, when leaders abandon institutional norms and the organizational hierarchy in favor of their own ad hoc judgments, and when leadership of the Department and the FBI are unable to speak directly with one another for the good of the institutions. Our report makes nine recommendations to assist the FBI and the Department in addressing these issues, most of which can be tied together through a common theme – that the FBI and the Department remain true to their foundational principles and values in all of their work.\n* * * *\nThe following summary is mostly taken from the Executive Summary of the OIG report.\nConduct of the Midyear Investigation\nThe FBI and Department referred to the investigation of Secretary Clinton’s emails as “Midyear Exam” or “Midyear.” The Midyear investigation was opened by the FBI in July 2015 based on a referral from the Office of the Intelligence Community Inspector General (IC IG). The investigation was staffed by prosecutors from the Department’s National Security Division (NSD) and the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of Virginia (EDVA), and agents and analysts selected primarily from the FBI’s Washington Field Office to work at FBI Headquarters.\nThe Midyear investigation focused on whether Clinton intended to transmit classified information on unclassified systems, knew that information included in unmarked emails was classified, or later became aware that information was classified and failed to report it. The Midyear team employed an investigative strategy that included three primary lines of inquiry: collection and examination of emails that traversed Clinton’s servers and other relevant evidence, interviews of relevant witnesses, and analysis of whether classified information was compromised by hostile cyber intrusions.\nAs described in Chapter Five of our report, we selected for examination particular investigative decisions that were the subject of public or internal controversy. These included the following:\nWith regard to these investigative decisions, we found, as detailed in Chapter Five, that the Midyear team:\nWe found that these decisions were occurring at a time when Comey and the Midyear team had already concluded that there was likely no prosecutable case and believed it was unlikely the culling laptops would change the outcome of the investigation;\nFor each of these decisions, we analyzed whether there was evidence of improper considerations, including bias, and also whether the justifications offered for the decision were a pretext for improper, but unstated, considerations.\nThe question we considered was not whether a particular investigative decision was the ideal choice or one that could have been handled more effectively, but whether the circumstances surrounding the decision indicated that it was based on considerations other than the merits of the investigation. If a choice made by the investigative team was among two or more reasonable alternatives, we did not find that it was improper even if we believed that an alternative decision would have been more effective.\nThus, a determination by the OIG that a decision was not unreasonable does not mean that the OIG has endorsed the decision or concluded that the decision was the most effective among the options considered. We took this approach because our role as an OIG is not to second-guess valid discretionary judgments made during the course of an investigation, and this approach is consistent with the OIG’s handling of such questions in past reviews.\nIn undertaking our analysis, our task was made significantly more difficult because of text and instant messages exchanged on FBI devices and systems by five FBI employees involved in the Midyear investigation. These messages reflected political opinions in support of former Secretary Clinton and against her then political opponent, Donald Trump. Some of these text messages and instant messages mixed political commentary with discussions about the Midyear investigation, and raised concerns that political bias may have impacted investigative decisions.\nIn particular, we were concerned about text messages exchanged by FBI Deputy Assistant Director Peter Strzok and Lisa Page, Special Counsel to the Deputy Director, that potentially indicated or created the appearance that investigative decisions were impacted by bias or improper considerations. As we describe in Chapter Twelve of our report, most of the text messages raising such questions pertained to the Russia investigation, which was not a part of this review. Nonetheless, the suggestion in certain Russia-related text messages in August 2016 that Strzok might be willing to take official action to impact presidential candidate Trump’s electoral prospects caused us to question the earlier Midyear investigative decisions in which Strzok was involved, and whether he took specific actions in the Midyear investigation based on his political views. As we describe in Chapter Five of our report, we found that Strzok was not the sole decisionmaker for any of the specific Midyear investigative decisions we examined in that chapter. We further found evidence that in some instances Strzok and Page advocated for more aggressive investigative measures in the Midyear investigation, such as the use of grand jury subpoenas and search warrants to obtain evidence.\nThere were clearly tensions and disagreements in a number of important areas between Midyear agents and prosecutors. However, we did not find documentary or testimonial evidence that improper considerations, including political bias, directly affected the specific investigative decisions we reviewed in Chapter Five, or that the justifications offered for these decisions were pretextual.\nNonetheless, these messages cast a cloud over the FBI’s handling of the Midyear investigation and the investigation’s credibility.  But our review did not find evidence to connect the political views expressed in these messages to the specific investigative decisions that we reviewed; rather, consistent with the analytic approach described above, we found that these specific decisions were the result of discretionary judgments made during the course of an investigation by the Midyear agents and prosecutors and that these judgment calls were not unreasonable. The broader impact of these text and instant messages, including on such matters as the public perception of the FBI and the Midyear investigation, are discussed in Chapter Twelve of our report.\nComey’s Public Statement on July 5, 2016\n“Endgame” Discussions\nAs we describe in Chapter Six of the report, by the Spring of 2016, Comey and the Midyear team had determined that, absent an unexpected development, evidence to support a criminal prosecution of Clinton was lacking. Midyear team members told us that they based this assessment on a lack of evidence showing intent to place classified information on the server, or knowledge that the information was classified. We describe the factors that the Department took into account in its decision to decline prosecution in Chapter Seven of our report and below.\nComey told the OIG that as he began to realize the investigation was likely to result in a declination, he began to think of ways to credibly announce its closing. Comey engaged then DAG Yates in discussions in April 2016 about the “endgame” for the Midyear investigation. Comey said that he encouraged Yates to consider the most transparent options for announcing a declination. Yates told the OIG that, as a result of her discussions with Comey, she thought the Department and FBI would jointly announce any declination.\nComey said he also told Yates that the closer they got to the political conventions, the more likely he would be to insist that a special counsel be appointed, because he did not believe the Department could credibly announce the closing of the investigation once Clinton was the Democratic Party nominee.However, we did not find evidence that Comey ever seriously considered requesting a special counsel; instead, he used the reference to a special counsel as an effort to induce the Department to move more quickly to obtain the Mills and Samuelson culling laptops and to complete the investigation.\nAlthough Comey engaged with the Department in these “endgame” discussions, he told us that he was concerned that involvement by then AG Loretta Lynch in a declination announcement would result in “corrosive doubt” about whether the decision was objective and impartial because Lynch was appointed by a President from the same political party as Clinton. Comey cited other factors to us that he said caused him to be concerned by early May 2016 that Lynch could not credibly participate in announcing a declination:\nAs we discuss below and in Chapter Six of our report, the meeting between Lynch and former President Clinton on June 27, 2016 also played a role in Comey’s decision to deliver a unilateral statement.\nComey did not raise any of these concerns with Lynch or Yates.  Rather, unbeknownst to them, Comey began considering the possibility of an FBI-only public statement in late April and early May 2016. Comey told the OIG that a separate public statement was warranted by the “500-year flood” in which the FBI found itself, and that he weighed the need to preserve the credibility and integrity of the Department and the FBI, and the need to protect “a sense of justice more broadly in the country—that things are fair not fixed, and they’re done independently.”\nComey’s Draft Statement\nComey’s initial draft statement, which he shared with FBI senior leadership on May 2, criticized Clinton’s handling of classified information as “grossly negligent,” but concluded that “no reasonable prosecutor” would bring a case based on the facts developed in the Midyear investigation. Over the course of the next 2 months, Comey’s draft statement underwent various language changes, including the following:\nEach version of the statement criticized Clinton’s handling of classified information. Comey told us that he included criticism of former Secretary Clinton’s uncharged conduct because “unusual transparency…was necessary for an unprecedented situation,” and that such transparency “was the best chance we had of having the American people have confidence that the justice system works[.]”\nOther witnesses told the OIG that Comey included this criticism to avoid creating the appearance that the FBI was “letting [Clinton] off the hook,” as well as to “messag[e]” the decision to the FBI workforce to emphasize that employees would be disciplined for similar conduct and to distinguish the Clinton investigation from the cases of other public figures who had been prosecuted for mishandling violations.\nThe Tarmac Meeting and Impact on Comey’s Statement\nOn June 27, 2016, Lynch met with former President Clinton on Lynch’s plane, which was parked on the tarmac at a Phoenix airport. This meeting was unplanned, and Lynch’s staff told the OIG they received no notice that former President Clinton planned to board Lynch’s plane. Both Lynch and former President Clinton told the OIG that they did not discuss the Midyear investigation or any other Department investigation during their conversation. Chapter Six of our report describes their testimony about the substance of their discussion.\nLynch told the OIG that she became increasingly concerned as the meeting “went on and on,” and stated “that it was just too long a conversation to have had.” Following this meeting, Lynch obtained an ethics opinion from the Departmental Ethics Office that she was not required to recuse herself from the Midyear investigation, and she decided not to voluntarily recuse herself either. In making this decision, Lynch told the OIG that stepping aside would create a misimpression that she and former President Clinton had discussed inappropriate topics, or that her role in the Midyear investigation somehow was greater than it was.\nOn July 1, during an interview with a reporter, Lynch stated that she was not recusing from the Midyear investigation, but that she ”fully expect[ed]” to accept the recommendation of the career agents and prosecutors who conducted the investigation, “as is the common process.” Then, in a follow up question, Lynch said “I’ll be briefed on [the findings] and I will be accepting their recommendations.” Lynch’s statements created considerable public confusion about the status of her continuing involvement in the Midyear investigation.\nAlthough we found no evidence that Lynch and former President Clinton discussed the Midyear investigation or engaged in other inappropriate discussion during their tarmac meeting, we also found that Lynch’s failure to recognize the appearance problem created by former President Clinton’s visit and to take action to cut the visit short was an error in judgment. We further concluded that her efforts to respond to the meeting by explaining what her role would be in the investigation going forward created public confusion and did not adequately address the situation.\nComey told the OIG that he was “90 percent there, like highly likely” to make a separate public statement prior to the tarmac meeting, but that the tarmac meeting “tipped the scales” toward making his mind up to go forward with his own public statement.\nComey’s Decision Not to Tell Department Leadership\nComey acknowledged that he made a conscious decision not to tell Department leadership about his plans to make a separate statement because he was concerned that they would instruct him not to do it. He also acknowledged that he made this decision when he first conceived of the idea to do the statement, even as he continued to engage the Department in discussions about the “endgame” for the investigation.\nComey admitted that he concealed his intentions from the Department until the morning of his press conference on July 5, and instructed his staff to do the same, to make it impracticable for Department leadership to prevent him from delivering his statement. We found that it was extraordinary and insubordinate for Comey to do so, and we found none of his reasons to be a persuasive basis for deviating from well-established Department policies in a way intentionally designed to avoid supervision by Department leadership over his actions.\nOn the morning of July 5, 2016, Comey contacted Lynch and Yates about his plans to make a public statement, but did so only after the FBI had notified the press—in fact, the Department first learned about Comey’s press conference from a media inquiry, rather than from the FBI. When Comey did call Lynch that morning, he told her that he was not going to inform her about the substance of his planned press statement.\nWhile Lynch asked Comey what the subject matter of the statement was going to be (Comey told her in response it would be about the Midyear investigation), she did not ask him to tell her what he intended to say about the Midyear investigation.  We found that Lynch, having decided not to recuse herself, retained authority over both the final prosecution decision and the Department’s management of the Midyear investigation. As such, we believe she should have instructed Comey to tell her what he intended to say beforehand, and should have discussed it with Comey.\nComey’s public statement announced that the FBI had completed its Midyear investigation, criticized Clinton and her senior aides as “extremely careless” in their handling of classified information, stated that the FBI was recommending that the Department decline prosecution of Clinton, and asserted that “no reasonable prosecutor” would prosecute Clinton based on the facts developed by the FBI during its investigation. We determined that Comey’s decision to make this statement was the result of his belief that only he had the ability to credibly and authoritatively convey the rationale for the decision to not seek charges against Clinton, and that he needed to hold the press conference to protect the FBI and the Department from the extraordinary harm that he believed would have resulted had he failed to do so. While we found no evidence that Comey’s statement was the result of bias or an effort to influence the election, we did not find his justifications for issuing the statement to be reasonable or persuasive.\nWe concluded that Comey’s unilateral announcement was inconsistent with Department policy and violated long-standing Department practice and protocol by, among other things, criticizing Clinton’s uncharged conduct. We also found that Comey usurped the authority of the Attorney General, and inadequately and incompletely described the legal position of Department prosecutors.\nThe Department’s Declination Decision on July 6\nFollowing Comey’s public statement on July 5, the Midyear prosecutors finalized their recommendation that the Department decline prosecution of Clinton, her senior aides, and the senders of emails determined to contain classified information. On July 6, the Midyear prosecutors briefed Lynch, Yates, Comey, other members of Department and FBI leadership, and FBI Midyear team members about the basis for the declination recommendation. Lynch subsequently issued a short public statement that she met with the career prosecutors and agents who conducted the investigation and “received and accepted their unanimous recommendation” that the investigation be closed without charges.\nWe found that the prosecutors considered five federal statutes:\nAs described in Chapter Seven of our report, the prosecutors concluded that the evidence did not support prosecution under any of these statutes for various reasons, including that former Secretary Clinton and her senior aides lacked the intent to communicate classified information on unclassified systems. Critical to their conclusion was that the emails in question lacked proper classification markings, that the senders often refrained from using specific classified facts or terms in emails and worded emails carefully in an attempt to “talk around” classified information, that the emails were sent to other government officials in furtherance of their official duties, and that former Secretary Clinton relied on the judgment of State Department employees to properly handle classified information, among other facts.\nWe further found that the statute that required the most complex analysis by the prosecutors was Section 793(f)(1), the “gross negligence” provision that has been the focus of much of the criticism of the declination decision. As we describe in Chapters Two and Seven of our report, the prosecutors analyzed the legislative history of Section 793(f)(1), relevant case law, and the Department’s prior interpretation of the statute. They concluded that Section 793(f)(1) likely required a state of mind that was “so gross as to almost suggest deliberate intention,” criminally reckless, or “something that falls just short of being willful,” as well as evidence that the individuals who sent emails containing classified information “knowingly” included or transferred such information onto unclassified systems.\nThe Midyear team concluded that such proof was lacking. We found that this interpretation of Section 793(f)(1) was consistent with the Department’s historical approach in prior cases under different leadership, including in the 2008 decision not to prosecute former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales for mishandling classified documents.\nWe analyzed the Department’s declination decision according to the same analytical standard that we applied to other decisions made during the investigation. We did not substitute the OIG’s judgment for the judgments made by the Department, but rather sought to determine whether the decision was based on improper considerations, including political bias. We found no evidence that the conclusions by the prosecutors were affected by bias or other improper considerations; rather, we determined that they were based on the prosecutors’ assessment of the facts, the law, and past Department practice.\nWe therefore concluded that these were legal and policy judgments involving core prosecutorial discretion that were for the Department to make.\nDiscovery in September 2016 of Emails on the Weiner Laptop\nDiscovery of Emails by the FBI’s New York Field Office\nIn September 2016, the FBI’s New York Field Office (NYO) and the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York (SDNY) began investigating former Congressman Anthony Weiner for his online relationship with a minor.  A federal search warrant was obtained on September 26, 2016, for Weiner’s iPhone, iPad, and laptop computer. The FBI obtained these devices the same day. The search warrant authorized the government to search for evidence relating to the following crimes: transmitting obscene material to a minor, sexual exploitation of children, and activities related to child pornography.\nThe Weiner case agent told the OIG that he began processing Weiner’s devices on September 26, and that he noticed “within hours” that there were “over 300,000 emails on the laptop.”  He said that either that evening or the next morning, he saw at least one BlackBerry PIN message between Clinton and Abedin, as well as emails between them. He said that he recalled seeing emails associated with “about seven domains,” such as yahoo.com, state.gov, clintonfoundation.org, clintonemail.com, and hillaryclinton.com.  The case agent immediately notified his NYO chain of command, and the information was ultimately briefed to NYO Assistant Director in Charge (ADIC) William Sweeney on September 28.\nReporting of Emails to FBI Headquarters\nAs we describe in Chapter Nine of our report, Sweeney took the following steps to notify FBI Headquarters about the discovery of Midyear-related emails on the Weiner laptop:\nMcCabe, and that approximately 39 senior FBI executives likely would have participated. Comey was not present for the SVTC.\nInitial Response of FBI Headquarters\nMcCabe told the OIG that he considered the information provided by Sweeney to be “a big deal” and said he instructed Priestap to send a team to New York to review the emails on the Weiner laptop. McCabe told the OIG that he recalled talking to Comey about the issue “right around the time [McCabe] found out about it.” McCabe described it as a “fly-by,” where the Weiner laptop was “like one in a list of things that we discussed.”\nComey said that he recalled first learning about the additional emails on the Weiner laptop at some point in early October 2016, although he said it was possible this could have occurred in late September 2016. Comey told the OIG that this information “didn’t index” with him, which he attributed to the way the information was presented to him and the fact that, “I don’t know that I knew that [Weiner] was married to Huma Abedin at the time.”\nText messages of FBI Deputy Assistant Director Peter Strzok indicated that he, McCabe, and Priestap discussed the Weiner laptop on September 28. Strzok said that he had initially planned to send a team to New York to review the emails, but a conference call with NYO was scheduled instead. The conference call took place on September 29, and five members of the FBI Midyear team participated. Notes from the conference call indicate the participants discussed the presence of a large volume of emails (350,000) on the Weiner laptop and specific domain names, including clintonemail.com and state.gov. The Midyear SSA said that NYO also mentioned seeing BlackBerry domain emails on the Weiner laptop.\nAdditional discussions took place on October 3 and 4, 2016. However, after October 4, we found no evidence that anyone associated with the Midyear investigation, including the entire leadership team at FBI Headquarters, took any action on the Weiner laptop issue until the week of October 24, and then did so only after the Weiner case agent expressed concerns to SDNY, prompting SDNY to contact the Office of the Deputy Attorney General (ODAG) on October 21 to raise concerns about the lack of action.\nReengagement of FBI Headquarters\nOn Friday, October 21, SDNY Deputy U.S. Attorney Joon Kim contacted ODAG and was put in touch with DAAG George Toscas, the most senior career Department official involved in the Midyear investigation. Thereafter, at Toscas’s request, one of the Midyear prosecutors called Strzok. This was the first conversation that the FBI had with Midyear prosecutors about the Weiner laptop.\nToscas said he asked McCabe about the Weiner laptop on Monday, October 24, after a routine meeting between FBI and Department leadership. McCabe told us that this interaction with Toscas caused him to follow up with the FBI Midyear team about the Weiner laptop and to call McCord about the issue.\nOn October 26, NYO, SDNY, and Midyear team members participated in a conference call.  The FBI Midyear team told the OIG that they learned important new information on this call, specifically: (1) that there was a large volume of emails on the Weiner laptop, particularly the potential for a large number of @clintonemail.com emails; and (2) that the presence of Blackberry data indicated that emails from Clinton’s first three months as Secretary of State could be present on the laptop.  However, as we describe above and in Chapter Nine of our report, these basic facts were known to the FBI by September 29, 2016.\nThe FBI Midyear team briefed McCabe about the information from the conference call on the evening of October 26, 2016. McCabe told us that he felt the situation was “absolutely urgent” and proposed that the FBI Midyear team meet with Comey the following day.\nOn October 27 at 5:20 a.m., McCabe emailed Comey stating that the Midyear team “has come across some additional actions they believe they need to take,” and recommending that they meet that day to discuss the implications “if you have any space on your calendar.” Comey stated that he did not know what this email was about when he received it and did not initially recall that he had been previously notified about the Weiner laptop.\nWe found that, by no later than September 29, FBI executives and the FBI Midyear team had learned virtually every fact that was cited by the FBI in late October as justification for obtaining the search warrant for the Weiner laptop, including that the laptop contained:\nAs we describe in Chapter Nine of our report, the explanations we were given for the FBI’s failure to take immediate action on the Weiner laptop fell into four general categories:\nWe found these explanations to be unpersuasive justifications for not acting sooner, given the FBI leadership’s conclusion about the importance of the information and that the FBI Midyear team had sufficient information to take action in early October and knew at that time that it would need a new search warrant to review any Clinton-Abedin emails.  Moreover, given the FBI’s extensive resources, the fact that Strzok and several other FBI members of the Midyear team had been assigned to the Russia investigation, which was extremely active during this September and October time period, was not an excuse for failing to take any action during this time period on the Weiner laptop.\nThe FBI’s failure to act in late September or early October is even less justifiable when contrasted with the attention and resources that FBI management and some members of the Midyear team dedicated to other activities in connection with the Midyear investigation during the same period. As detailed in Chapter Eight, these activities included:\nIn assessing the decision to prioritize the Russia investigation over following up on the Midyear-related investigative lead discovered on the Weiner laptop, we were particularly concerned about text messages sent by Strzok and Page that potentially indicated or created the appearance that investigative decisions they made were impacted by bias or improper considerations. Most of the text messages raising such questions pertained to the Russia investigation, and the implication in some of these text messages, particularly Strzok’s August 8 text message (“we’ll stop” candidate Trump from being elected), was that Strzok might be willing to take official action to impact a presidential candidate’s electoral prospects. Under these circumstances, we did not have confidence that Strzok’s decision to prioritize the Russia investigation over following up on the Midyear- related investigative lead discovered on the Weiner laptop was free from bias.\nWe searched for evidence that the Weiner laptop was deliberately placed on the back-burner by others in the FBI to protect Clinton, but found no evidence in emails, text messages, instant messages, or documents that suggested an improper purpose. We also took note of the fact that numerous other FBI executives—including the approximately 39 who participated in the September 28 SVTC—were briefed on the potential existence of Midyear-related emails on the Weiner laptop. We also noted that the Russia investigation was under the supervision of Priestap—for whom we found no evidence of bias and who himself was aware of the Weiner laptop issue by September 29. However, we also did not identify a consistent or persuasive explanation for the FBI’s failure to act for almost a month after learning of potential Midyear-related emails on the Weiner laptop.\nThe FBI’s inaction had potentially far-reaching consequences. Comey told the OIG that, had he known about the laptop in the beginning of October and thought the email review could have been completed before the election, it may have affected his decision to notify Congress. Comey told the OIG, “I don’t know [if] it would have put us in a different place, but I would have wanted to have the opportunity.”\nComey’s Decision to Notify Congress on October 28\nFollowing the briefing from the FBI Midyear team on October 27, 2016, Comey authorized the Midyear team to seek a search warrant, telling the OIG that “the volume of emails” and the presence of BlackBerry emails on the Weiner laptop were “two highly significant facts.” As we describe in Chapter Thirteen of our report, McCabe joined this meeting by phone but was asked not to participate, and subsequently recused himself from the Midyear investigation on November 1, 2016.\nThe issue of notifying Congress of the Weiner laptop development was first raised at the October 27 briefing and, over the course of the next 24 hours, numerous additional discussions occurred within the FBI. As we describe in Chapter Ten of our report, the factors considered during those discussions included:\nAs a result of these discussions on October 27, Comey decided to notify Congress about the discovery of Midyear-related emails on the Weiner laptop. Comey told us that, although he “believe[d] very strongly that our rule should be, we don’t comment on pending investigations” and that it was a “very important norm” for the Department to avoid taking actions that could impact an imminent election, he felt he had an obligation to update Congress because the email discovery was potentially very significant and it made his prior testimony no longer true.\nWe found no evidence that Comey’s decision to send the October 28 letter was influenced by political preferences. Instead, we found that his decision was the result of several interrelated factors that were connected to his concern that failing to send the letter would harm the FBI and his ability to lead it, and his view that candidate Clinton was going to win the presidency and that she would be perceived to be an illegitimate president if the public first learned of the information after the election.  Although Comey told us that he “didn’t make this decision because [he] thought it would leak otherwise,” several FBI officials told us that the concern about leaks played a role in the decision.\nMuch like with his July 5 announcement, we found that in making this decision, Comey engaged in ad hoc decisionmaking based on his personal views even if it meant rejecting longstanding Department policy or practice. We found unpersuasive Comey’s explanation as to why transparency was more important than Department policy and practice with regard to the reactivated Midyear investigation while, by contrast, Department policy and practice were more important to follow with regard to the Clinton Foundation and Russia investigations.\nComey’s description of his choice as being between “two doors,” one labeled “speak” and one labeled “conceal,” was a false dichotomy. The two doors were actually labeled “follow policy/practice” and “depart from policy/practice.” Although we acknowledge that Comey faced a difficult situation with unattractive choices, in proceeding as he did, we concluded that Comey made a serious error of judgment.\nDepartment and FBI Leadership Discussions\nOn October 27, Comey instructed his Chief of Staff, James Rybicki, to reach out to the Department about his plan to notify Congress. As we describe in Chapter Ten of our report, Comey told the OIG that he decided to ask Rybicki to inform the Department rather than to contact Lynch or Yates directly because he did not “want to jam them and I wanted to offer them the opportunity to think about and decide whether they wanted to be engaged on it.” Rybicki and Axelrod spoke on the afternoon of October 27 and had “a series of phone calls” the rest of the day. Rybicki told Axelrod that Comey believed he had an obligation to notify Congress about the laptop in order to correct a misimpression that the Midyear investigation was closed.\nLynch, Yates, Axelrod, and their staffs had several discussions that same day as to whether Lynch or Yates should call Comey directly, but said they ultimately decided to have Axelrod communicate “the strong view that neither the DAG nor [AG] felt this letter should go out.”  Yates told us they were concerned that direct contact with Comey would be perceived as “strong-arming” him, and that based on her experience with Comey, he was likely to “push back hard” against input from Lynch or her, especially if accepting their input meant that he had to go back to his staff and explain that he was reversing his decision. She said that she viewed Rybicki as the person they needed to convince if they wanted to change Comey’s mind. Accordingly, Axelrod informed Rybicki on October 27 of the Department’s strong opposition to Comey’s plan to send a letter.\nRybicki reported to Comey that the Department “recommend[ed] against” the Congressional notification and thought it was “a bad idea.” Although Comey told us that he would not have sent the letter if Lynch or Yates had told him not to do so, he said he viewed their response as only a recommendation and interpreted their lack of direct engagement as saying “basically...it’s up to you.... I honestly thought they were taking kind of a cowardly way out.” The following day, October 28, Comey sent a letter to Congress stating, in part, that “the FBI has learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the [Midyear] investigation.”\nComey, Lynch, and Yates faced difficult choices in late October 2016. However, we found it extraordinary that Comey assessed that it was best that the FBI Director not speak directly with the Attorney General and Deputy Attorney General about how best to navigate this most important decision and mitigate the resulting harms, and that Comey’s decision resulted in the Attorney General and Deputy Attorney General concluding that it would be counterproductive to speak directly with the FBI Director. We believe that open and candid communication among leaders in the Department and its components is essential for the effective functioning of the Department.\nText and Instant Messages, Use of Personal Email, and Alleged Improper Disclosures of Non-Public Information\nText Messages and Instant Messages\nAs we describe in Chapter Twelve, during our review we identified text messages and instant messages sent on FBI mobile devices or computer systems by five FBI employees who were assigned to the Midyear investigation. These included:\nThe text messages and instant messages sent by these employees included statements of hostility toward then candidate Trump and statements of support for candidate Clinton, and several appeared to mix political opinions with discussions about the Midyear investigation.\nWe found that the conduct of these five FBI employees brought discredit to themselves, sowed doubt about the FBI’s handling of the Midyear investigation, and impacted the reputation of the FBI. Although our review did not find documentary or testimonial evidence directly connecting the political views these employees expressed in their text messages and instant messages to the specific investigative decisions we reviewed in Chapter Five, the conduct by these employees cast a cloud over the FBI Midyear investigation and sowed doubt the FBI’s work on, and its handling of, the Midyear investigation. Moreover, the damage caused by their actions extends far beyond the scope of the Midyear investigation and goes to the heart of the FBI’s reputation for neutral factfinding and political independence.\nWe were deeply troubled by text messages exchanged between Strzok and Page that potentially indicated or created the appearance that investigative decisions were impacted by bias or improper considerations. Most of the text messages raising such questions pertained to the Russia investigation, which was not a part of this review. Nonetheless, when one senior FBI official, Strzok, who was helping to lead the Russia investigation at the time, conveys in a text message to another senior FBI official, Page, “No. No he won’t. We’ll stop it” in response to her question “[Trump’s] not ever going to become president, right? Right?!”, it is not only indicative of a biased state of mind but, even more seriously, implies a willingness to take official action to impact the presidential candidate’s electoral prospects. This is antithetical to the core values of the FBI and the Department of Justice.\nWe do not question that the FBI employees who sent these messages are entitled to their own political views. However, we believe using FBI devices to send the messages discussed in Chapter Twelve—particularly the messages that intermix work-related discussions with political commentary—potentially implicate provisions in the FBI’s Offense Code and Penalty Guidelines. At a minimum, we found that the employees’ use of FBI systems and devices to send the identified messages demonstrated extremely poor judgment and a gross lack of professionalism. We therefore refer this information to the FBI for its handling and consideration of whether the messages sent by the five employees listed above violated the FBI’s Offense Code of Conduct.\nUse of Personal Email\nAs we also describe in Chapter Twelve, we learned during the course of our review that Comey, Strzok, and Page used their personal email accounts to conduct FBI business.\nWe identified numerous instances in which Comey used a personal email account to conduct unclassified FBI business. We found that, given the absence of exigent circumstances and the frequency with which the use of personal email occurred, Comey’s use of a personal email account for unclassified FBI business to be inconsistent with Department policy.\nWe found that Strzok used his personal email accounts for official government business on several occasions, including forwarding an email from his FBI account to his personal email account about the proposed search warrant the Midyear team was seeking on the Weiner laptop. This email included a draft of the search warrant affidavit, which contained information from the Weiner investigation that appears to have been under seal at the time in the Southern District of New York and information obtained pursuant to a grand jury subpoena issued in the Eastern District of Virginia in the Midyear investigation. We refer to the FBI the issue of whether Strzok’s use of personal email accounts violated FBI and Department policies.\nFinally, when questioned, Page also told us she used personal email for work- related matters at times. She stated that she and Strzok sometimes used these forums for work-related discussions due to the technical limitations of FBI-issued phones. Page left the FBI on May 4, 2018.\nImproper Disclosure of Non-Public Information\nAs we also describe in Chapter Twelve, among the issues we reviewed were allegations that Department and FBI employees improperly disclosed non-public information regarding the Midyear investigation. Although FBI policy strictly limits the employees who are authorized to speak to the media, we found that this policy appeared to be widely ignored during the period we reviewed.\nWe identified numerous FBI employees, at all levels of the organization and with no official reason to be in contact with the media, who were nevertheless in frequent contact with reporters. Attached to this report as Attachments E and F are two link charts that reflect the volume of communications that we identified between FBI employees and media representatives in April/May and October 2016. The OIG did not obtain information reflected in the chart by accessing records relating to any member of the media.  We have profound concerns about the volume and extent of unauthorized media contacts by FBI personnel that we have uncovered during our review.\nIn addition, we identified instances where FBI employees improperly received benefits from reporters, including tickets to sporting events, golfing outings, drinks and meals, and admittance to nonpublic social events. We will separately report on those investigations as they are concluded, consistent with the Inspector General Act, other applicable federal statutes, and OIG policy.\nThe harm caused by leaks, fear of potential leaks, and a culture of unauthorized media contacts is illustrated in Chapters Ten and Eleven of our report, where we detail the fact that these issues influenced FBI officials who were advising Comey on consequential investigative decisions in October 2016. The FBI updated its media policy in November 2017, restating its strict guidelines concerning media contacts, and identifying who is required to obtain authority before engaging members of the media, and when and where to report media contact. We do not believe the problem is with the FBI’s policy, which we found to be clear and unambiguous. Rather, we concluded that these leaks highlight the need to change what appears to be a cultural attitude among many in the organization.\nRecusal Issues\nFormer Deputy Director Andrew McCabe\nAs we describe in Chapter Thirteen, in 2015, McCabe’s spouse, Dr. Jill McCabe, ran for a Virginia State Senate seat. During the campaign, Dr. McCabe’s campaign committee received substantial monetary and in-kind contributions, totaling $675,288 or approximately 40 percent of the total contributions raised by Dr. McCabe for her state senate campaign, from then Governor McAuliffe’s Political Action Committee (PAC) and from the Virginia Democratic Party. In addition, on June 26, 2015, Hillary Clinton was the featured speaker at a fundraiser in Virginia hosted by the Virginia Democratic Party and attended by Governor McAuliffe.\nAt the time his wife sought to run for state senate, McCabe was the Assistant Director in Charge of the FBI’s Washington Field Office (WFO) and sought ethics advice from FBI ethics officials and attorneys. We found that FBI ethics officials and attorneys did not fully appreciate the potential significant implications to McCabe and the FBI from campaign donations to Dr. McCabe’s campaign. The FBI did not implement any review of campaign donations to assess potential conflicts or appearance issues that could arise from the donations. On this issue, we believe McCabe did what he was supposed to do by notifying those responsible in the FBI for ethics issues and seeking their guidance.\nAfter McCabe became FBI Deputy Director in February 2016, McCabe had an active role in the supervision of the Midyear investigation, and oversight of the Clinton Foundation investigation, until he recused himself from these investigations on November 1, 2016. McCabe voluntarily recused himself on November 1, at Comey’s urging, as the result of an October 23 article in the Wall Street Journal identifying the substantial donations from McAuliffe’s PAC and the Virginia Democratic Party to Dr. McCabe.\nWith respect to these investigations, we agreed with the FBI’s chief ethics official that McCabe was not at any time required to recuse under the relevant authorities.  However, voluntary recusal is always permissible with the approval of a supervisor or ethics official, which is what McCabe did on November 1. Had the FBI put in place a system for reviewing campaign donations to Dr. McCabe, which were public under Virginia law, the sizable donations from McAuliffe’s PAC and the Virginia Democratic Party may have triggered prior consideration of the very appearance concerns raised in the October 23 WSJ article.  Finally, we also found that McCabe did not fully comply with this recusal in a few instances related to the Clinton Foundation investigation.\nFormer Assistant Attorney General Peter Kadzik\nIn Chapter Fourteen, we found that Kadzik demonstrated poor judgment by failing to recuse himself from Clinton-related matters under federal ethics regulations prior to November 2, 2016. Kadzik did not recognize the appearance of a conflict that he created when he initiated an effort to obtain employment for his\nson with the Clinton campaign while participating in Department discussions and communications about Clinton-related matters.\nKadzik also created an appearance of a conflict when he sent the Chairman of the Clinton Campaign and a longtime friend, John Podesta, the “Heads up” email that included the schedule for the release of former Secretary Clinton’s emails proposed to the court in a FOIA litigation without knowing whether the information had yet been filed and made public. His willingness to do so raised a reasonable question about his ability to act impartially on Clinton-related matters in connection with his official duties.\nAdditionally, although Department leadership determined that Kadzik should be recused from Clinton-related matters upon learning of his “Heads up” email to Podesta, we found that Kadzik failed to strictly adhere to this recusal. Lastly, because the government information in the “Heads up” email had in fact been released publicly, we did not find that Kadzik released non-public information or misused his official position.\nFBI Records Vault Twitter Announcements\nAs we describe in Chapter Fifteen, on November 1, 2016, in response to multiple FOIA requests, the FBI Records Management Division (RMD) posted records to the FBI Records Vault, a page on the FBI’s public website, concerning the “William J. Clinton Foundation.” The @FBIRecordsVault Twitter account announced this posting later the same day. We concluded that these requests were processed according to RMD’s internal procedures like other similarly-sized requests, and found no evidence that the FOIA response was expedited or delayed in order to impact the 2016 presidential election. We also found no evidence that improper political considerations influenced the FBI’s use of the Twitter account to publicize the release.\nConclusions and Recommendations\nThe Midyear Investigation is not the first time the Department and the FBI have conducted a politically-charged investigation, and it will not be the last. To protect the institutions from allegations of abuse, political interference, and biased enforcement of the law, the Department and the FBI have developed policies and practices to guide their decisions. In the vast majority of cases, they are followed as a matter of routine. But they are most important to follow when the stakes are the highest, and when the pressures to divert from them—often based on well- founded concerns and highly fraught scenarios—are the greatest. It is in these moments—when the rationale for keeping to the ordinary course fades from view and the temptation to make an exception is greatest—that the bedrock principles and time-tested practices of the Department and the FBI can serve their highest purpose.\nOur report makes nine recommendations to the Department and the FBI to assist them in addressing the issues that we identified in this review:\nDepartment of Justice\nIn memory of OIG Special Agent William \"Buddy\" Sentner\nPrivacy Policy | Legal Policies & Disclaimers | No Fear Act | Sitemap",

            "report_content": "The crown prince of Bahrain is not Hillary Clinton’s friend, at least not in the way most people use that word. Nor is he particularly friendly with Huma Abedin, a top Clinton deputy, or the co-founder of the Clinton Global Initiative Doug Band.\nAnd yet for some reason, in June 2009, Band wrote an email to Abedin asking for a meeting between the Secretary of State and Salman bin Hamad bin Isa al-Khalifa. “Good friend of ours,” Band said of the crown prince. Abedin, who would later work for Band’s consulting firm while still drawing a public salary at the State Department, promptly set up an appointment with Clinton three days later.\nAt that point, Salman had already announced he would fund a scholarship program through the Clinton Initiative, to which he would commit a total of $32 million, in addition to a direct gift to the Clinton Foundation from his kingdom for more than $50,000. The State Department said at the time that Clinton and the crown prince discussed Middle East relations, and Clinton’s campaign says such donations played no role in speeding the meeting at the State Department. “Hillary Clinton never took action as Secretary of State because of donations to the Clinton Foundation,” says spokesman Josh Schwerin.\nBut Clinton and her staff, not to mention the staff of former President Bill Clinton, did have many friends. And with some of those friendships came privileges, and often seven-figure purse strings. A review by the Associated Press found that more than half the private individuals whom Clinton met with while at the State Department, according to publicly available records from the first half of her tenure, had donated to the foundation. That’s 85 of the 154 people outside government, not including donors like Salman, who was a foreign official.\nFriendship, for the Clintons, has always had a broad definition. The Democratic nominee often describes her family’s biggest lifetime donors as her closest friends. And the feeling is often mutual. One man she calls “my dear friend,” S. Daniel Abraham, is a major donor to Clinton campaigns and the foundation, and has met frequently with both Clintons over the years to discuss his favorite cause of finding peace in Israel. In an interview with TIME, he said the millions he has given to the Clintons’ efforts do not influence their relationship. “It was what you’d think,” he said, of his meetings with her at State. “I am a friend of theirs, and they are a friend of mine.”\nHaving friends with financial benefits is not a crime. In the 2010 Citizens United decision, the Supreme Court ruled that both “ingratiation and access” were “not corruption,” absent other official acts resulting from donations. As a State Department spokesman put it, after the conservative group Judicial Watch forced the release of more emails through the Freedom of Information Act, “This was simply, you know, evidence of the way the process works.”\nBut the perks of Clinton friendship do conflict with the central promise of her campaign, to take on the corruption of Washington and fight every day on the side of working people. “Democracy can’t be just for billionaires,” she has said.\nEven if Clinton is elected President, the former First Couple has decided to continue operating the Clinton Foundation, though under a new arrangement. Foreign and corporate donations will be banned, Bill Clinton will step down from its board, and the Clinton Global Initiative will stop holding annual meetings after this September. But the Clintons’ sole heir, Chelsea, is expected to remain involved, benefiting from a major fundraising effort for a foundation endowment that Hillary led in 2014.\nThere is no sign that a President Hillary Clinton would make adjustments to her social circle. As news of the latest emails broke, she attended a $50,000-per-person fundraiser at the Beverly Hills home of Haim Saban–whom Bill Clinton has called a “very good friend”–where she later spent the night. Saban and his wife have given more than $10 million to Clinton campaign efforts this season and more than $10 million to the foundation. Her campaign said she spoke at the event about the ways in which “everybody plays a role in creating America’s future.”\nThis appears in the September 05, 2016 issue of TIME.\nContact us at letters@time.com.",

            "report_content": "As Donald Trump has focused the messaging of his presidential campaign in recent weeks, he's centered on one key attack on Democrat Hillary Clinton: The suggestion that the Clinton Foundation was a pay-to-play front that enabled Hillary and Bill Clinton to trade government access and favors for money.\n\"It's impossible to figure out where the Clinton Foundation ends and the State Department begins,\" Trump said Tuesday night in Texas. \"It is now abundantly clear that the Clintons set up a business to profit from public office. They sold access and specific actions by and to them for money.\"\nBill and Hillary Clinton have defended the foundation's work under the intensifying attacks. \"We're trying to do good things,\" Bill Clinton said Wednesday. \"If there's something wrong with creating jobs and saving lives, I don't know what it is. The people who gave the money knew exactly what they were doing. I have nothing to say about it except that I'm really proud.\"\nThe Clintons don't directly profit from the foundation, despite Trump's accusation. Neither Bill nor Hillary Clinton draws a salary from it, according to tax documents.\nThe Clinton Foundation very much mirrors former President Bill Clinton's public image. It is ambitious. It is sprawling and, at times, unfocused. Its practices raise many ethical red flags that political observers say could have easily been avoided. And yet it has also delivered concrete results in public policy fields as wide-ranging as lowering the price of HIV/AIDS medication in sub-Saharan Africa to combating childhood obesity.\nWhat, exactly, does the Clinton Foundation do?\nA lot.\nThe Clinton Foundation is where Bill Clinton focused his efforts after leaving office in 2001. Initially formed to raise funds for and build Clinton's presidential library, the foundation morphed into one of the world's most ambitious nonprofit organizations over the past 16 years.\nIt has shrunk, grown and been reorganized several times. In its present form, the foundation is a constellation of nine different initiatives and two \"affiliated entities,\" each focused on achieving a different public policy goal.\nThat includes lowering the cost of HIV/AIDS medication; addressing climate change; improving education in Haiti; and an annual conference that gathers heads of state, world leaders and celebrities to New York City, where they all make philanthropic promises.\nThe Clintons frequently point to the foundation's Health Access Initiatives, saying they have lowered the cost of HIV/AIDS treatment around the world, and helped deliver cheaper drugs to more than 9 million people. That's a claim PolitiFact rated as true.\nThe foundation is organized around the idea of convening and connecting. \"We believe that the best way to unlock human potential is through the power of creative collaboration,\" its website states. \"That's why we build partnerships between businesses, NGOs, governments and individuals everywhere to work faster, leaner and better.\"\nAs The New York Times explained it:\n\"Instead of handing out grants, the foundation recruits donors and advises them on how best to deploy their money or resources, from helping Procter & Gamble donate advanced water-purification packets to developing countries to working with credit card companies to expand the volume of low-cost loans offered to poor inner city residents.\"\nAll those programs require a whole lot of money. The foundation has raised more than $2 billion since 2001, according to The Washington Post.\nThe foundation also didn't used to be so polarizing. Plenty of Republicans have spoken at the Clinton Global Initiative, including Mitt Romney just 42 days before the 2012 election.\n\"Since serving as president, President Clinton has devoted himself to lifting people around the world,\" Romney said then. \"And one of the best things to happen to any cause, to any people, is to have Bill Clinton as its advocate.\"\nEven Donald J. Trump gave between $100,001 and $250,000 to the foundation.\nSo what's the problem?\nThe problem is all that money — and whether donors were motivated by anything other than pure goodwill and philanthropy. Namely: whether they gave because of the promise of access to and favors from Hillary Clinton, who was just beginning her career in public office at the time that Bill Clinton had ended his.\nEvery former president has set up some sort of foundation and aggressively raised money to fund it. Only one former president — Bill Clinton — has been married to someone eyeing her own run for the White House.\nEmails released this month by conservative advocacy group Judicial Watch highlight several instances during Hillary Clinton's tenure as secretary of state where Clinton Foundation staffers contacted the State Department soliciting favors for people who had donated to the organization.\nHere's how The New York Times characterized one email conversation:\n\"In April 2009, Douglas J. Band, who led the foundation's Clinton Global Initiative, emailed Ms. Abedin and Cheryl D. Mills, another top adviser to Mrs. Clinton, for help with a donor.\n\"Mr. Band wrote that he needed to connect Gilbert Chagoury, a Lebanese-Nigerian billionaire who was one of the foundation's top donors, with someone at the State Department to talk about his interests in Lebanon.\n\" 'It's Jeff Feltman,' Ms. Abedin answered, referring to Jeffrey Feltman, who was the American ambassador to Lebanon at the time. 'I'm sure he knows him. I'll talk to Jeff.'\n\"Mr. Band asked her to call Mr. Chagoury immediately if possible. 'This is very important,' he wrote.\"\nIn another exchange that year, Band emailed Huma Abedin — a close Clinton aide who was working at the State Department at the time — to request that Clinton meet with Crown Prince Salman of Bahrain, whom he referred to as a \"good friend of ours.\"\nShe responded:\nFrom: Huma Abedin\nTo: Doug Band\nSent: Tue Jun 23 4:12:46 2009\nSubject: Re:\nHe asked to see hrc thurs and fri thru normal channels. I asked and she said she doesn't want to commit to anything for thurs or fri until she knows how she will feel. Also she says that she may want to go to ny and doesn't want to be committed to stuff in ny...\nAbedin then followed up, offering the crown prince a sitdown with Clinton. \"If u see him, let him know,\" she wrote Band. \"We have reached out through official channels.\"\nAt a 2005 Clinton Global Initiative event, Salman committed $32 million to youth scholarship programs. That wasn't a donation to the Clinton Foundation itself — just a promise to spend the money to help \"Bahraini students to take leadership roles in the private and public sectors.\"\nAdditionally, the Kingdom of Bahrain has donated more than $50,000 to the Clinton Foundation itself, according to the group's records.\nThe Clinton campaign has repeatedly denied that the Department of State took any action in response to contributions to the Clinton Foundation.\nWhat's this about Secretary Clinton meeting with foundation donors, though?\nRepublicans' attacks on the Clinton Foundation intensified this week after The Associated Press published an article claiming that \"more than half\" of the private citizens Clinton met with as secretary of state were foundation donors.\n\"It's an extraordinary proportion indicating her possible ethics challenges if elected president,\" the article stated.\nExcept that's not quite the full story. The AP ignored the thousands of meetings that Clinton held with government officials from the United States and other countries. \"Such meetings would presumably have been part of her diplomatic duties,\" the news organization argued.\nClinton's campaign said that framing created an unfair picture. \"This story relies on utterly flawed data,\" Clinton spokesman Brian Fallon said in a statement. \"It cherry-picked a limited subset of Secretary Clinton's schedule to give a distorted portrayal of how often she crossed paths with individuals connected to charitable donations to the Clinton foundation.\"\nFallon said there were more than 1,700 Clinton meetings that were not factored in.\nStill, no matter what the total percentage was, Clinton still sat down 40 people who had donated more than $100,000 to the Clinton Foundation, and 20 who had donated more than $1 million, according to the AP's tallies.\nThere's no question the optics are bad for Clinton and the Clinton Foundation. But no proof has emerged that any official favors — regulations, government contracts, international deals — were curried in exchange for donations or pledges.\nOne case that Clinton critics point to involves banking giant UBS, which was locked in a tense battle with the Internal Revenue Service when Clinton took office in 2009. The Wall Street Journal published a detailed look at Clinton's dealings with the bank:\n\"The Internal Revenue Service was suing UBS AG to get the identities of Americans with secret accounts. If the case proceeded, Switzerland's largest bank would face an impossible choice: Violate Swiss secrecy laws by handing over the names, or refuse and face criminal charges in U.S. federal court.\n\"Within months, Mrs. Clinton announced a tentative legal settlement — an unusual intervention by the top U.S. diplomat. UBS ultimately turned over information on 4,450 accounts, a fraction of the 52,000 sought by the IRS, an outcome that drew criticism from some lawmakers who wanted a more extensive crackdown.\n\"From that point on, UBS's engagement with the Clinton family's charitable organization increased. Total donations by UBS to the Clinton Foundation grew from less than $60,000 through 2008 to a cumulative total of about $600,000 by the end of 2014, according to the foundation and the bank.\"\nThe bank also paid Bill Clinton $1.5 million for a series of private speeches.\nBut it's not like the UBS standoff wasn't already a top diplomatic concern for Clinton. According to The Journal, it was the very first issue Switzerland's foreign minister brought up with Clinton when the two met in the early months of Clinton's tenure.\nSorting out the overlapping lines of the Clinton Foundation and the State Department are murky, because the types of people and groups who are apt to make major donations to a top-tier international nonprofit are the same types of people and groups who would seek out — and be granted — meetings with top State Department officials.\nThe Clinton campaign pointed this out in its response to the AP story. The AP included Melinda Gates, for example, in its tally of donors whom Clinton met with while at State.\n\"Melinda Gates is a world-renowned philanthropist whose foundations works to address global health crises and eradicate disease in the developing world,\" Fallon said in his statement. \"Meeting with someone like Melinda Gates is squarely in the purview of America's top diplomat, whose job involves confronting these game global challenges.\"\n'Unraveling' the foundation\nWhen Clinton joined the Obama administration, the Obama Transition Team put together a memorandum of understanding that aimed at unblurring the lines between Clinton's official duties at the State Department, and the work her family's foundation was carrying out in similar fields.\nThe foundation agreed to disclose its donors on an annual basis. It also spun off the Clinton Global Initiative — that annual confab of world leaders — and its HIV/AIDS Initiative into separate, but still related, entities. The foundation also agreed to inform the State Department of any foreign contributions.\nStill, it was hard to keep everything separate. Take the two Clinton staffers from those email exchanges: Doug Band and Huma Abedin. Toward the end of Clinton's tenure, Abedin sought and was granted \"special government employee\" status, which meant she could work part time for both the State Department and outside groups. She ended up doing work for the Clinton Foundation, as well as Teneo Holdings, a consulting firm run by Band.\nAnd while Band, a longtime aide to Bill Clinton, never worked for State, he also held multiple roles within the Clintons' orbit. As Eric Lichtblau of The New York Times recently explained it to NPR:\n\"He is a personal assistant to Bill Clinton. He ran a consulting company that paid Bill Clinton a lot of money until 2012. He is also the head of Clinton's Global Initiative which gets together muckety mucks from all over the world for big charity events, and he's with the Clinton Foundation. So to figure out at any one time which hat someone like Doug Band is wearing when he communicates with aides to Hillary Clinton is a bit of a puzzle.\"\nThe Clinton Foundation recently announced changes that would take place if Hillary Clinton is elected president. Bill Clinton would step down from its board; the foundation would stop accepting foreign money; the Clinton Global Initiative would end after next month.\nAnd, NPR learned Tuesday, the foundation will work to \"spin off\" many of its international efforts.\n\"The most important thing to the president and to Chelsea is that the work continues but under different umbrellas away from the foundation, obviously, because we will not be able to accept corporate donations or international money as we have to support our programs,\" foundation President Donna Shalala told NPR.\nThat announcement has not satisfied Trump and other Republicans, who are now calling — on a near-daily basis — for the Clintons to shut the entire foundation down.\nCopyright 2021 NPR.

Photo: Joshua Lott/Getty Images\nDonations to the Clinton Foundation plummeted to $16 million last year, down nearly 75% from the organization's peak when former secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton was running for president, records reviewed by Axios show.\nWhy it matters: The foundation was a financial juggernaut in the years after Bill Clinton served as president and while his wife led her own political career. In the time since, COVID-19 shuttered the sort of public events that had driven millions to the group — although Clinton loyalists expect increased donations this year.\nBy the numbers: The foundation received about $16.3 million in contributions during 2020, according to a new annual tax filing.\nWhat they're saying: Last year \"was a difficult year for philanthropy,\" wrote foundation CEO Kevin Thurm in a letter accompanying its annual financials. \"Across the sector, resources were stretched thinly and fundraising activities were impacted.\"\nMuch of the foundation's work was focused on pandemic-related activity in 2020, according to descriptions of its programs in its tax filing and Thurm's summary of its 2020 programs.\nBetween the lines: The foundation has historically relied on large events to court contributions — events that had to either be canceled during most of 2020 or converted to a virtual format.\nIllustration: Sarah Grillo/Axios\nBoth parties are ramping up fundraising for secretary of state races, which in just a couple of years have gone from obscure down-ballot contests to high-profile races that could reshape American democracy.\nWhy it matters: Secretaries of state are many states' chief election administrators, making them crucial to efforts to alter election rules. Former President Trump is working to game the rules in his favor — and Democrats are trying to impede him.\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi.

His place as one of the ex-president‘s top aides on Jan. 6, makes him a key target in the investigation.",

            "report_content": "The charitable foundation Bill Clinton set up in 2001 now casts a shadow over Hillary’s campaign due to potential conflict of interest with the state department\nLast modified on Fri 14 Jul 2017 19.50 BST\nBill Clinton spoke out on Wednesday with a heartfelt defence of the charitable foundation that he set up 15 years ago and that now casts a shadow over his wife Hillary’s presidential campaign.\n“We’re trying to do good things,” he told reporters in Atlanta. “If there’s something wrong with creating jobs and saving lives, I don’t know what it is. The people who gave the money knew exactly what they were doing. I have nothing to say, except I’m really proud of the work they’ve done.”\nBut the issue of a potential conflict of interest between the Clinton Foundation and state department, where Hillary was secretary from 2009 to 2013, has dogged her election campaign this week, finally taking some heat off rival Donald Trump.\nInterpretations range from corruption “bigger than Watergate”, as former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani put it, to manufactured scandal. Late night TV host Stephen Colbert summed up the ambivalence: “The Clinton Foundation scandal lands right up there as ‘maybe a thing’, which is the same ranking as bald guys with pony tails, because it may not be a crime but it sure don’t look good.”\nSmoke without fire? Suddenly the Clinton Foundation finds itself on trial.\nIt was essentially Bill Clinton’s answer to the perennially tricky question of what ex-presidents should do next. He is not the first to create a foundation – and the Obama Foundation is already at work – but he is the first to have a spouse run for the White House. Hence the uniquely awkward situation.\nBill Clinton launched the public charity after leaving the White House in 2001. It sought to bring together governments, businesses and social groups to tackle the world’s most pressing problems: health, climate change, economic development and opportunities for girls and women.\nThe Washington Post wrote last year: “The Clinton Foundation is an ingenious machine that can turn something intangible – the Clintons’ global goodwill – into something tangible: money. For the Clintons’ charitable causes. For their aides and allies. And, indirectly, for the Clintons themselves.”\nMore than 6,000 donors who have already provided the Clinton charity with more than $2bn in funding since its creation, the Associated Press reported. It has a staff of nearly 500 people.\nThe foundation clearly means a lot to the 42nd president. Addressing staff recently, Bill Clinton commented: “I’ve done a lot of interesting things in my life, and I don’t think I’ve ever done anything that I’ve loved this much as this foundation.” He admitted the prospect of scaling it down “is like a root canal for me”.\nLarry Noble, general counsel of the Campaign Legal Center, says: “The foundation does real work. It’s not a sham organisation.”\nIt claims to have “dramatically improved” the lives of millions of people around the world. Clinton’s supporters say it enabled the number of people receiving HIV/Aids medication to soar from 200,000 to 11.5 million and supported physical education programmes that helped more than 18 million students.\nLaura Seay, an academic who witnessed the foundation’s work firsthand in east Africa, said: “The perspective that it is some kind of slush fund is based on a real misunderstanding of what the Clinton Foundation does. The Clintons don’t take a salary from it.”\nSeay was researching a PhD from 2005 to 2007 in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo, where militias roamed and few aid organisations ventured. She recalled how, with Clinton Foundation funding, the Heal Africa hospital in Goma treated 60 HIV-positive Congolese children, most of whom survived. “I know teens & young adults who were kids then & are alive today because the Clinton Foundation saved their lives when no one else would,” she tweeted.\nSeay, assistant professor of government at Colby College in Waterville, Maine, adds in an interview: “The Clinton Foundation was the organisation that took the risk on this. What it showed was that in really difficult circumstances you can save a lot of lives and change the way a lot of NGOs think about conflict zones. It really was remarkable.”\nClinton also used his name to negotiate with international pharmaceutical giants to slash the price of HIV/Aids drugs, Seay argues.\nThe foundation has been particularly active in Rwanda but not without criticism. According to the New York Times, in 2011 it successfully lobbied Hillary Clinton’s state department to approve an unconventional medical training programme there. A dispute over the plan was mediated by Cheryl Mills, who spent five years on the foundation board before switching to the state department.\nThe foundation’s banner event, the annual Clinton Global Initiative meeting, is a forum for philanthropists to announce funding commitments including, in 2007, $2m to help build the Agahozo-Shalom Youth Village for orphans of the genocide and Aids.\nSpeaking by phone from Rwanda, its director, Jean-Claude Nkulikiyimfura, says of the foundation: “It seems to be doing some very good work in the country. Its work in health could be extremely beneficial.”\nSupport from the foundation is also a superb calling card for non-government organisations seeking other partners, he adds. “Having the Clinton Foundation name in the list of donors may encourage other funders to provide support.”\nThe foundation agreed to voluntarily disclose the names and donations of its contributors after Clinton was nominated to be secretary of state in late 2008, despite not being legally obliged to do so. It holds an A rating from CharityWatch, having spent 88% of its budget on programmes rather than overheads.\nIts list of donors includes Trump, who gave between $100,000 and $250,000 in 2009 and has attended a meeting of the Clinton Global Initiative. One Clinton ally, noting Trump’s demands for a special prosecutor to look into the foundation, says: “As a donor, Trump is calling for an investigation of himself.”\nHowever, the Politifact website contends that the foundation violated its memorandum of understanding with the state department with three significant omissions, including not reporting a $500,000 donation from Algeria in 2010.\nPay for play. Donors to the foundation are said to have jumped the queue and gained special access to the state department. The AP wrote this week: “More than half the people outside the government who met with Hillary Clinton while she was secretary of state gave money – either personally or through companies or groups – to the Clinton Foundation. It’s an extraordinary proportion indicating her possible ethics challenges if elected president.”\nThe AP found that at least 85 of 154 people with private interests who either met or had phone conversations scheduled with Clinton also gave a combined total of $156m to her family’s charities. Trump, struggling in the polls, sensed an opening and piled on. “It’s hard to tell where the Clinton Foundation ends and the state department begins,” he told a rally on Wednesday night.\nGiuliani fumed: “It is now abundantly clear that the Clintons set up a business to profit from public office. They sold access and specific actions for money. This makes a mockery of her promise to Congress and the president to keep the Clinton Foundation and the state department entirely separate. In other words, they merged the two into the Clinton family racketeering enterprise.”\nBut Hillary Clinton insists that the data was cherry picked from a subset of her schedule. She told CNN on Wednesday: “I know there’s a lot of smoke and there’s no fire. This AP report? Put it in context, excludes nearly 2,000 meetings I had with world leaders, plus countless other meetings with government officials when I was secretary of state. It looked at a small portion of my time.\n“It drew the conclusion and made the suggestion that my meetings with people like the late, great, Elie Wiesel, or Melinda Gates, or the Nobel prize winner, Muhammad Yunus were somehow due to connections with the foundation instead of their status as highly respected global leaders. That is absurd. These are people I was proud to meet with, who any secretary of state would have been proud to meet with and hear about their work and their insight.”\nHowever, there has also been a steady trickle of emails into the public domain that reveal how donors sought meetings with Clinton by trying to call in favours from the foundation. Crown Prince Salman of Bahrain did get an appointment but others did not, and the Clinton camp insists the meetings were arranged through official channels.\nHillary Clinton’s close aide Huma Abedin, who features prominently in the emails, appears to embody the tension, having worked at the state department while also being contracted to the Clinton Foundation.\nNo. Evidence of a causal link has not come to light, at least not yet. Elizabeth Trudeau, a spokesperson for the state department, says: “The state department is not aware of any actions that were influenced by the Clinton Foundation.” There is no proof of a quid pro quo or anything illegal.\nBut Peter Schweizer, author of the book Clinton Cash and a senior editor-at-large at Breitbart News, said: “It’s naive to believe that people throw money at politics and don’t expect something in return. They claimed there was going to be a wall between the Clinton Foundation and state department and this clearly shows there was communication between people at the Clinton Foundation and state department. There needs to be an investigation into exactly what happened and we also need legislation. We can’t allow politicians to police themselves on these matters.”\nThe foundation was a useful “conduit” for the Clintons to avoid the normal rules governing contributions to politicians, Schweizer adds. “You look at Huma Abedin who was on the payroll of both the Clinton Foundation and state department. I don’t think ‘inevitable overlap’ involves dual payrolls.”\nNot good, especially as it fills a new vacuum in the dog days of August in which Trump has managed to avoid his usual attention-grabbing gaffes. It gives the appearance, at least, of a blurred line and intersecting interests between the Clinton Foundation and state department.\n“The frequency of the overlaps shows the intermingling of access and donations, and fuels perceptions that giving the foundation money was a price of admission for face time with Clinton,” the AP report said.\nScott Amey, general counsel at the Project on Government Oversight, said: “I think this is an example that may not be illegal but certainly should have been handled with more communication to show there was no actual or apparent conflicts of interest.\n“The question is, in giving money to the Clinton Foundation, did donors feel they deserved or were going to receive special access to Hillary at the state department? We don’t know. Only time will tell. It seems some favours were called in and some minor efforts were made to provide access.”\nPerhaps some overlap between between the entities was inevitable. But Amey adds: “One of the biggest mistakes here is they didn’t set up proper firewalls to prevent those blurred lines. I would be less sceptical if I had seen emails back from the state department saying: ‘We can’t do this, you should go through the official channels.’”\nFrom an editorial in the Washington Post: “It would have been much better to take these measures when Ms Clinton started at state. At this point, especially given the emerging record of contacts, they are probably not enough.”\nAnd Schweizer comments: “It’s too little too late. If it’s inappropriate for her to do as president, why was it appropriate as secretary of state?”\nOne Clinton ally responds: “I think being in charge is another matter.”\nOpinion is divided. An editorial in USA Today said: “The only way to eliminate the odor surrounding the foundation is to wind it down and put it in mothballs, starting today, and transfer its important charitable work to another large American charity such as the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.”\nOthers believe that would be going too far. Noble says of Clinton: “I don’t know if you have to shut it down. If you look at it like a business, what you have to do is totally separate yourself from it. If you’re going to run for president, there are sacrifices you’ve got to make.”\nSeay tweeted on Wednesday:",
