If you think you have been discriminated against and would like our assistance, please visit our Report LGBTQ and HIV Discrimination Page and we can help you figure out whether you are protected under federal or state laws.\nEmployers with 15 or more employees are prohibited by Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act from discriminating on the basis of sex. Some courts have ruled that Title VII also bans discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity. The Supreme Court recently announced it will take up this question in three cases. In addition, many states and cities have laws that ban this kind of discrimination.\nIf you feel that you have experienced discrimination at work, you can file a complaint with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), which has taken the position that LGBTQ people are protected under Title VII. But it’s possible that the EEOC may change its position on this question during the Trump administration.\nWe encourage you to contact your local ACLU affiliate or the national ACLU LGBT & HIV Project for help weighing your options.\nIf you’ve been discriminated against based on sexual orientation or gender identity, the ACLU may be able to help. Contact us by filling out an intake form.\nThe federal Fair Housing Act prohibits sex discrimination by most landlords. We believe this should also be interpreted by the courts to protect LGBTQ people. State and local laws where you live may also bar this discrimination.\n \tHousing discrimination against people with HIV/AIDS, or people perceived to have HIV/AIDS, is also illegal under the Fair Housing Act’s protections against disability discrimination.\n \tHousing providers that receive funding from the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) or have loans insured by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA), as well as lenders insured by FHA, are subject to HUD’s Equal Access Rule, which bans discrimination in HUD programs on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity.\nWhat you can do depends largely on where the discrimination took place, whether any state or local laws there might apply to your situation, and where things stand under the current administration. We encourage you to contact your local ACLU affiliate or the national ACLU LGBT & HIV Project for help weighing your options.\nIf you’ve been discriminated against based on sexual orientation or gender identity, the ACLU may be able to help. Contact us by filling out an intake form.\nThere is no federal law that bans discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity in public accommodations, like restaurants, theaters and other businesses. However, state and local laws where you live may ban this kind of discrimination.\nIf you’ve been discriminated against based on sexual orientation or gender identity, the ACLU may be able to help. Contact us by filling out an intake form.\nTitle IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 bans discrimination on the basis of sex by public schools, and several federal courts have ruled that Title IX protects LGBTQ students from discrimination or harassment.\n \tFederal courts have held that Title IX requires public schools to respond to harassment based on appearance or behavior that doesn’t conform to gender stereotypes: boys who wear makeup, girls who wear pants, or students who are transgender or non-binary. The First Amendment right to free expression can also apply to school dress codes.\n \tYour constitutional right to privacy makes it illegal for your school to “out” you to anyone without your permission, even if you’re out to other people at school.\n \tThe First Amendment protects your right to express yourself in public schools. That includes bringing a same-sex date to prom or any school event.\n \tYour right to be yourself in school includes the right to be transgender or transition at school. While the law in this area is evolving, a growing number of courts have found that Title IX and the Constitution protect transgender students’ right to access sex-separated programs and facilities consistent with their gender identity. Some state and local laws also explicitly protect transgender students from discrimination in schools.\nDocument everything. Take notes and keep copies of any emails with school administrators relevant school forms, etc.\nIf anyone at school is harassing or threatening you, it’s crucial that you report every incident to a principal or counselor. Usually schools must be put on notice before they can be held legally responsible for protecting you.\nIf you have reported harassment or any other kind of discrimination to your school officials and they have done little or nothing to stop it, we encourage you to contact your local ACLU affiliate or the national ACLU LGBT & HIV Project for help weighing your options.\nIf you’ve been discriminated against based on sexual orientation or gender identity, the ACLU may be able to help. Contact us by filling out an intake form.\nHere are open letters on variety of LGBTQ issues that you can use when advocating for your rights with school administrators.\nState and local laws that prohibit discrimination based on gender identity or expression should protect transgender people’s right to use restrooms and locker rooms that match their gender identity. We believe that laws that ban sex discrimination should also be interpreted by the courts to protect transgender people. While federal law in this area is uncertain, most courts to address this question have found in favor of transgender people being able to access facilities most consistent with their gender identity.\n \tIn some places, state and local nondiscrimination laws are much clearer about transgender people’s right to use gender identity-appropriate public restrooms. Many businesses, universities, and other public places are converting their restrooms to all-gender spaces.\nSome places — for example, states like Colorado, Iowa, Oregon, and Washington, and cities like San Francisco and New York City — specifically grant transgender people the right to use gender identity-appropriate restrooms in public spaces.\nOther places, like Chicago, continue to allow businesses to decide whether transgender patron may access men’s or women’s restrooms based on the gender on their ID, which may or may not reflect accurately the person’s gender identity.\nSome cities — like Austin, Texas, New York City, Philadelphia, and West Hollywood — require that single-stall public restrooms be labeled as all-gender.\nWhat you can do depends largely on where the discrimination took place, whether any state or local laws there might apply to your situation, and where things are with federal lawsuits currently in play.

Simply fill out your passport application (typically Form DS-11) and check the M or F box that is most appropriate for you.\n \tThe State Department will be adding an X designation on US passports, however it is not currently available. We expect to see additional information from the State Department on obtaining an X designation by the end of 2021 or early 2022. Once this designation is available you will be able to self-select an M, F, or X on your passport.\nThe State Department website has additional information about selecting your gender marker.\nThere is no legal obligation to have consistent gender markers on various documents, and you should obtain the gender marker on each document that is most comfortable for you.\n \tDifferent gender markers on documents may cause administrative confusion if you show them at the same time, or if there is a discrepancy between the gender marker on your ID and the marker in your record. The confusion may be uncomfortable when interacting with an agent, but can usually be cleared up with a conversation.\n© 2021 American Civil Liberties Union",

            "report_content": "Some politicians and commentators have justified bills (like North Carolina’s HB2 legislation) that restrict transgender people’s access to restrooms, locker rooms, and other gender-specific public facilities by claiming they’re necessary to protect women and girls from sexual violence and harassment. Know Your IX firmly rejects the argument that anti-trans bathroom bills prevent sexual violence and strongly favors laws and policies guaranteeing transgender people equal rights and dignity in education, including in accessing facilities that match their gender identity. As advocates fighting sexual assault on campus and beyond, we know that bathroom bills don’t prevent gender-based violence; they exacerbate it. Here’s why:\nTransgender Equal Rights Bills Don’t Cause Sexual Assault\nHalf of Americans already live under state or local laws which protect transgender people in public places—including by allowing them to use bathrooms and other public facilities consistent with the gender they live every day. Despite this, right-wing politicians can’t point to any evidence of a public safety threat in the 17 states and hundreds of cities that have implemented transgender non-discrimination protections. Neither can anyone else; a 2014 Center for American Progress report found that “law enforcement officers in […] jurisdictions with protections found no increase in rape or sexual assaults stemming from gender identity and expression nondiscrimination laws.”\nBathroom Bills Put Transgender People At Risk\nThe Center for American Progress found that 70% of transgender people surveyed experienced harassment, discrimination, or even physical violence in a public restroom. Bathroom bills force transgender people to out themselves by going to restrooms inconsistent with their gender identities—putting them at a greater risk of hate violence. Because transgender people are verbally harassed or assaulted in public bathrooms, many trans people avoid using them, which puts them at risk of health problems like kidney infections or urinary-tract infections.\nHB2 does nothing to protect women who are not transgender from sexual violence; instead, it put transgender women forced to use the men’s restroom at a higher risk of harassment and physical violence themselves.\nBathroom Bills Prevent Transgender Students from Accessing Their Education\nTitle IX’s prohibition of sex discrimination in education means that schools are required to address gender-based harassment and violence—whether that’s sexual assault or the bullying of a trans student—if it is so severe or pervasive that it affects a student’s ability to get their education. That’s why Title IX requires schools to let transgender students use the restrooms, locker rooms, and other gender-segregated facilities consistent with their gender identity; so trans students can participate fully in all the educational opportunities their school has to offer.\nOne study in New York found that 75% of transgender students reported verbal harassment over the course of a single year, and that one in three had been physically assaulted; as a result of Nizagara Online study, more than half at some point avoided school for fear of harassment; 15% were forced out of school altogether. Bathroom bills send the dangerous message that transgender students, and their gender identity, shouldn’t be respected—the same message that leads to bullying, harassment, and violence against transgender students.\nKnow Your IX supports the many active campaigns for full equality led by transgender rights organizations.

            "report_content": "Every student needs to use the restroom, and every student should expect safety and privacy when using them. However, state lawmakers are attempting to pass laws that would invade everyone’s personal and medical privacy by requiring all students to prove that their anatomy matches either the sex on their birth certificate or the sign at the door of a restroom. Who will be responsible for conducting these inspections? How will they do that? In practice, these gender inspection bills risks everyone’s safety and privacy in restrooms, including transgender people.\nThese laws are an unprecedented governmental invasion of privacy. While they invade everyone’s personal and medical privacy, they single out transgender students making them vulnerable to bullying and discrimination. We should stand against any attempt to enact school gender inspection bills, which undermine the safety and privacy of all students.\nSeventeen states, Washington, D.C., more than 200 cities, and a number of school districts nationwide protect the privacy of everyone in restrooms, including transgender people, allowing everyone to use the facility that corresponds with who they are. According to law enforcement and school administrators in those states, cities and school districts, there has been no increase in reports of restroom harassment or violence. What is often forgotten is that inappropriate behavior in restrooms is already illegal. Respecting the ability of all students, including transgender students, to use the restroom that matches who they are does not increase indecent behavior in restrooms, nor does it make it permissible under the law.\nThese bills exacerbates harassment that already exist in our schools, where nearly nine in ten transgender students are verbally harassed due to their gender expression (87 percent) and more than half have also been physically assaulted (53 percent), according to a 2009 GLSEN report. This legislation adds to the hostile climate facing transgender youth in schools, which leads to lower educational outcomes and higher rates of truancy than for non-transgender students. Most alarmingly, 51 percent of respondents who reported being bullied in school have attempted suicide, according to the 2011 National Transgender Discrimination Survey.\nRestroom restrictions add unnecessary anxiety to the lives of transgender students. Instead of focusing on their studies, transgender students are forced to stress over which restroom might be safe for them to use throughout the day, if at all. Some transgender students will forego restroom use, avoid eating or drinking in order to avoid using the restroom, or choose to skip school altogether. All of these behaviors can cause lasting health problems for transgender students. As parents and teachers, our most important job is to make sure all of our kids are healthy, loved, and grow up to be contributing members of society. But school gender inspection bills make all of our students less safe, and for transgender students, makes it impossible for them to participate in their education.",

            "report_content": "Employers are legally required to provide workers reasonable access to restroom facilities. The U.S. Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) requires that employers make toilet facilities available so that employees can use them when they need to do so, and the employer may not impose unreasonable restrictions on employee use of the facilities.\nFurther, OSHA has issued guidance to employers on best practices regarding restroom access for transgender workers. The core principal of these guidelines is that all employees, including transgender employees, should have access to restrooms that correspond to their gender identity.\nNo federal, state or municipal laws or regulations specifically pertaining to gender identity require employers to utilize one type of bathroom over another, or to construct new facilities to accommodate transgender individuals. However, some jurisdictions regulate aspects of these restrooms. For example, the District of Columbia requires single-occupant restroom facilities in any public space (e.g., restaurants) to be gender neutral  – restrooms designed for use by one individual at a time may not have a specific gender designation with \"male\" or \"female\" signage or icons – but does not require employers to have single-occupant restrooms instead of another type.\nPlease note that other laws and regulations (unrelated to gender identity) governing commercial or public accommodations may require the use of one type of restroom over another.\nAllow employees to access gender-segregated facilities such as locker rooms and bathrooms corresponding to the gender with which they identify. Co-workers uncomfortable with a transgender employee’s use of the same restroom or locker room should be advised to use separate facilities.\nRestrooms and locker rooms can be a challenging topic for transgender and non-transgender employees alike. Allowing employees to use the facility that corresponds with their gender identity not only dignifies transgender people, it also ensures that the employer is not in violation of Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulations or of local or state non-discrimination laws where they exist. Further, preventing a transgender person from using the restroom that corresponds with their gender identity and expression may be construed as discriminatory under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act.\nRemember that many people value privacy, not just transgender employees – so employers may consider creating single-use, gender-neutral restrooms for all employees to use in addition to gender-segregated restrooms. Keep in mind that any decision to require transgender employees to use a certain restroom could be discriminatory and could lead to liability risks for the employer.\nWhere multiple occupant, gender-segregated restrooms already exist, employers may can enhance privacy with features such as flaps to cover gaps in stall doors or stall walls and doors that extend from floor to ceiling.\nFor locker rooms, employers should create private changing areas using stalls or curtains. Most employers can create at least one such area with minimal trouble or investment. Further, where showering facilities are necessary, it is best for the privacy of all employees to have individual stalls. Again, where building facilities and options are limited, having at least one private, single stall shower will accommodate employees desiring additional privacy.Employers should grant unrestricted restroom access and use according to an employee's full-time gender presentation. No single solution will work for every worksite, however, all employers need to find solutions that are safe, convenient and respect transgender employees; working with your transgender employees to devise a practical and dignified solution to restroom access issues is essential.\nWhile no single solution will work for every worksite, employers committed to transgender inclusion should be able to find reasonable solutions that maintain the dignity and respect of all their employees.\nEmployers' options for reasonable restroom access may be limited by the physical set-up of their office, industrial or retail facilities. Fortunately, any of the following options can be employed.\nUsers of multiple-occupant restrooms might appreciate the following privacy enhancements:\nEnsure private shower and changing areas in locker rooms and other facilities using stalls or curtains.\nTo view a sample restroom policy, click here.\nThe Human Rights Campaign Foundation is working to change the institutions of daily life for LGBTQ+ people.

Government actions in a variety of states and localities, including North Carolina and Houston, Texas, brought this issue to the fore beginning in 2015 and 2016.\nSee the sections below for further information:\nAs of June 2018, 18 states and the District of Columbia had adopted anti-discrimination laws that included protections for transgender people. Generally speaking, these laws applied to employment, housing, and public accommodations. These states are listed in the table below. As of June 2018, there was no federal anti-discrimination law that provided protections on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity.[4]\nHigh school student Gavin Grimm identified as a transgender male. After coming out as transgender, he began using the men's restroom in school. After nearly two months, parents of other children of the school complained to the Gloucester County School Board, which then created a policy prohibiting transgender students from using the restroom that corresponds to their gender identity. Grimm sued, arguing that the school board was violating Title IX, a federal law prohibiting gender discrimination in schools that receive federal funding. The United States Department of Education had—in a January 7, 2015, letter—interpreted this ban on gender discrimination as including discrimination against people based on their gender identities and their use of bathrooms.[5]\nAfter U.S. District Judge Robert Doumar ruled against Grimm, the case was appealed to the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals, which overturned the lower court's ruling in a 2-1 decision. The court affirmed the right of the U.S. Department of Education to interpret Title IX and remanded the case back to the district court with instructions to allow Grimm's lawsuit to move forward. In June 2016, the U.S. Eastern District Court of Virginia ruled that Grimm should be allowed to use the men's restroom. The Gloucester County School Board then asked the U.S. Supreme Court to consider the issue. In August 2016, The U.S. Supreme Court granted the school district's request to block the lower court's ruling until a full appeal was made, meaning Grimm was not allowed to use the men's restroom.  On October 28, 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court granted certiorari on the school board's petition, indicating that the court would hear the case during the court's October 2016 term.[6][7][8][9][10]\nArgument in the case was scheduled for March 28, 2017; however, on March 6, 2017, the judgment in the case was vacated and the case was remanded to the United States Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit in consideration of new guidance issued by the U.S. Department of Justice and the U.S. Department of Education on February 22, 2017.[11]\nJulienne Goins, a transgender woman, began consistently identifying as female in 1995. In May 1997, Goins was hired to work at West Group's Rochester, New York, office. Later that year, she transferred to a West Group facility in Eagan, Minnesota. Prior to the formal transition, Goins was observed using the women's restroom at the Eagan facility. West Group's director of human resources, upon consultation with other employees and the company's legal counsel, \"decided to enforce the policy of restroom use according to biological gender.\" The director of human resources determined that Goins should use single-occupancy restrooms at the facility.[12]\nThis decision was communicated to Goins on her first day of work at the Eagan facility. According to court documents, \"Goins refused to comply with the restroom use policy, in protest in part, and continued to use the employee women's restroom closest to her workstation.\" In November 1997, Goins' superiors \"threatened [her] with disciplinary action if she continued to disregard the restroom policy.\" In January 1998, Goins resigned (declining a promotion and salary increase). In her resignation letter, Goins claimed that the human resources department \"had treated her in a manner that had caused undue stress and hostility.\"[12]\nGoins filed suit in district court, \"alleging that [West Group] had engaged in discrimination based on sexual orientation.\" Ultimately, in 2001, the case came before the Minnesota Supreme Court, which ruled against Goins. According to the state supreme court, \"an employer's designation of employee restroom use based on biological gender is not sexual orientation discrimination in violation of the [Minnesota Human Rights Act].\"[12]\nIn the fall of 2007, Nicole Maines began the fifth grade at Asa Adams School, an elementary school in Orono, Maine. Assigned male at birth, Nicole began to identify as a girl as a toddler and throughout elementary school. Nicole, who had been using girls' bathroom facilities at Asa Adams for some time prior, continued to do so upon entering the fifth grade, with the support of school personnel. Soon after the commencement of the school year, a male student \"followed [Nicole] into the restroom on two separate occasions, claiming that he, too, was entitled to use the girls' bathroom. The student was acting on instructions from his grandfather, who was his guardian and was strongly opposed to the school's decision to allow Nicole to use the girls' bathroom.\" As a result of this controversy, school officials prohibited Nicole from using the girls' restroom. Instead, officials instructed Nicole to use a unisex staff bathroom. In December 2007, school officials \"determined that Nicole would not be permitted to use the girls' bathroom\" upon transitioning to middle school. Subsequently, the Maines family decided to move to another part of the state.[13][14]\nOn April 10, 2008, Nicole's mother, Kelly Maines, filed a complaint with the Maine Humans Rights Commission \"alleging that the superintendent and other school district entities violated the [Maine Human Rights Act] by excluding Nicole from the communal girls' bathroom at Asa Adams.\" The commission unanimously agreed. On September 23, 2009, Nicole's parents, Kelly and Wayne Maines, filed suit against the school district in Maine Superior Court, \"asserting claims for unlawful discrimination in education and unlawful discrimination in a place of public accommodation on the basis of sexual orientation.\" On November 10, 2012, Judge William Anderson ruled in favor of the district, finding that the district had \"acted within the bounds of its authority in prohibiting [Nicole] from using the girls' restroom; it did not itself harass [her] by its actions, and it was not deliberately indifferent to the harassment that [she] had experienced from others.\" The Maines family appealed the decision to the Maine Supreme Court.[13][15]\nOn January 30, 2014, the Maine Supreme Court ruled 5-1 in favor of the Maines family, reversing the lower court's decision. The court found that school officials had violated the state's anti-discrimination law. According to the Washington Blade, this decision marked \"the first time a state court has ruled that trans students must be allowed to use a bathroom consistent with their gender identity.\"\n2018:\nBallotpedia tracked the following 2018 statewide ballot measures pertaining to lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people.\n2017:\nBallotpedia did not track any 2017 statewide ballot measures pertaining to lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people that were certified for the ballot.\nThe following is a list of recent bills that have been introduced in or passed by the state legislatures.
