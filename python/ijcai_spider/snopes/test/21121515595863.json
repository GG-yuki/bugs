            "report_content": "Donald Trump has been a consistent opponent of marriage equality. He has embraced the nation’s most odious anti-LGBTQ law, North Carolina’s HB2, and put on the ticket Mike Pence, who has become the face of anti-LGBTQ discrimination after signing a bill to allow businesses to discriminate and deny service to LGBTQ people because of who they are or whom they love. Trump has also said he would sign the so-called First Amendment Defense Act (FADA) which would enable Kim Davis-style discrimination across the country.\nMarriage: Trump has been a consistent opponent of marriage equality. He said that he opposed it because he was a “traditional” guy, choosing to support domestic partnership benefits instead. Trump later reversed himself and said he also opposed civil unions. Despite a brief flirtation with “evolving” in 2013, Trump has consistently maintained his opposition to marriage equality, sometimes by citing polling and making an analogy to his dislike of long golf putters. After the Supreme Court ruling, Trump said the court had made its decision and, although he disagreed with the ruling, he did not support a constitutional amendment that would allow states to re-ban marriage equality. He later said he would appoint Supreme Court judges who would be committed to overturning the ruling.\nDiscrimination: While Trump at one time said that federal law should protect people from discrimination based on sexual orientation, he has taken aggressively anti-equality positions as a formal candidate. Trump has expressed support for the so-called First Amendment Defense Act (FADA) which would lead to more Kim Davis-style discrimination. He has declined to support the Equality Act.\nTransgender Equality: Trump has expressed support for North Carolina’s HB2, he’s said he would rescind the Obama Administration’s guidance that transgender students be treated wtih dignity and allowed to use restrooms that match their gender identity, and when it comes to governors like Pat McCrory that write discrimination into state law, Trump has made it clear he would not enforce federal civil rights laws ensure transgender Americans are treated equally under the law.\nExecutive Order: Trump has said that he disagrees with President Obama’s use of executive orders, but has shown willingness to use them himself.\nConversion Therapy: Unclear\nAdoption: Unclear\nAnti-Bullying: Unclear\nHarmful Rhetoric: Trump has hired two operatives with a history of anti-equality rhetoric to leads his campaign. Prior to becoming a candidate, Trump said that Pat Buchanan’s anti-LGBTQ rhetoric was disgusting, and he said that LGBTQ groups were glad he was hosting the Miss Universe pageant in Russia to challenge the status quo. But he launched ad hominem attacks on Ariana Huffington and Bette Midler, and he defended a CEO who resigned after opposing Proposition 8 and an NFL player who criticized Michael Sam.\nTrump’s Notable Quotes on LGBTQ Equality\nTrump Said He Would “Strongly Consider” Appointing Judges To Overturn Same-Sex Marriage Decision.

Like them, don't like them, that the president uses them to go around Congress?” TRUMP: Well, I don't like them. And our country wasn't based on executive orders. Nobody really knew that we even had an executive order, such a thing. It's supposed to be you get along with Congress, and you cajole, and you go back and forth, and everybody gets in a room and we end up with deals. And there's compromise on lots of other things, but you end up with deals. Here's a guy just goes -- he's given up on the process and he just goes and signs executive orders on everything. DICKERSON: “So, if you were president -- you seem like kind of guy if you were president you might use an executive order or two, though.” TRUMP: “Well, I will say this. There's lot of precedent, based on what he's doing. Now, some have been -- his executive order on the border, amazingly, the courts actually took that back a step and did something that was very surprising, which is, they did the right thing, so that maybe that one -- but I would be rescinding a lot of executive orders that he's done.

It would be simple. It would be straightforward. We don’t need to rewrite the laws currently on the books, although I do think we need to address hate-crimes legislation. But amending the Civil Rights Act would grant the same protection to gay people that we give to other Americans—it’s only fair.

I mean he left a job to take this job and they had a campaign against him and … I think it’s really unfair,’ Trump said. ‘The president and just about everybody supported traditional marriage. … What they’ve done to this man is really life shattering and very unfair.’” [Politico, 4/14/2014 ]\nTrump Said He “Didn’t Like” Russian Anti-LGBTQ Propaganda Laws, But That “The Gay Groups Over In Moscow Are Loving The Fact That We’re Going Over There” For Miss Universe Pageant. Mediaite reported: “On his show today, Roberts asked Trump if he has ‘concerns about the Russian laws [on LGBTQ propaganda] having a negative impact on the contest this year?’ ‘Well, I don’t like it,’ Trump said. ‘I don’t like what that is all about and, as you know, and I think you probably feel very similar to me, we can go over there and maybe make a difference.’ ‘You can avoid it, and that’s one way of handling it,’ Trump continued, “or you can go over and perhaps make a difference.”….Trump added that ‘Going in the face of some of their rules, regulations or laws is something that, frankly, we can avoid it and hide, which I don’t think is good, and I can tell you the gay groups over in Moscow are loving the fact that we’re going over there. So we can hide or we can do something about it. And I think you’re going to do something about it, and I think I’m going to do something about it.’ Trump also revealed that ‘We have invited Vladimir Putin, and I know for a fact that he wants very much to come, but we’ll have to see. We haven’t heard yet, but we have invited him.’” [Mediaite, 10/18/2013 ; MSNBC 10/18/2013]\nTrump Said Of Michael Sam Draft Day Kiss “I Don’t Know — If Everyone Thinks That’s A Wonderful Thing, I Guess That’s Fine With Me. But It Looked Pretty Out There To Me.” Raw Story reported: “During his weekly Fox & Friends morning segment, Fox News host Steve Doocy asked Trump if there was a ‘double standard’ in the NFL that allowed Tim Tebow to be mocked for openly Christian displays, but praised ‘Michael Sam for being gay.’ ‘Well, I guess there must be,’ Trump agreed. ‘Because, Tim Tebow, he went through hell. They went after him like crazy.’ ‘And I didn’t really get to see much because I was leaving New York, but I was watching as he got [chosen],’ the reality TV star continued. ‘But I did see his reaction with the birthday cake or the cake. And you know, I don’t know — if everyone thinks that’s a wonderful thing, I guess that’s fine with me. But it looked pretty out there to me.’” [Raw Story, 5/12/2014 ; Fox and Friends, 5/12/2014; VIDEO]\nTrump Said America Was “Going To Hell” For Political Correctness Because Player Was Fined For Criticizing Michael Sam Draft Selection Kiss. Raw Story reported that during a segment on Fox and Friends, “Fox News host Elisabeth Hasselbeck wondered if fining Jones [for his reaction to Michael Sam kissing his boyfriend after he was drafted] was a ‘reasonable reaction to his reaction.’ Trump called it a ‘pretty tough reaction,’ and said that America was ‘going to hell’ because of political correctness. ‘People are afraid to talked, afraid to express their own thoughts. And you know, that’s their view,’ Trump noted. ‘I’ve heard many people who thought the display after he was chosen was inappropriate. And whether or not it was, I don’t know.’ ‘But it was certainly out there a little bit… I hope he does so well, but I thought when he, you know, when he was really going at it — I haven’t seen anything like that in a while. He was really going at it.’” [Raw Story, 5/12/2014 ; Fox and Friends, 5/12/2014; VIDEO]\nTrump Referred To Caitlyn Jenner By Former Name And Pronouns And Criticized The Ratings For “I Am Cait.” In an interview with the Hollywood Reporter, Trump was asked: “And now we have Caitlyn Jenner and transgender politics; things have moved fast.” Trump responded: “How did that show do? Somebody said it was going badly…..I'm not surprised at the ratings. I just think it wouldn't interest you. I knew him a little bit when Bruce was a great athlete.

NPR News reported in June 2016, “But by Wednesday, the tone had shifted. While Trump seemed to still be showing sympathy to gays and lesbians, the delivery was off for many watching — his talk shifted from support for the community to boastful pride. ‘The LGBT community, the gay community, the lesbian community — they are so much in favor of what I've been saying over the last three or four days,’ Trump said during a campaign stop in Atlanta on Wednesday, defending his tough talk on limiting Muslim immigration and fighting ISIS. ‘Ask the gays what they think and what they do, in, not only Saudi Arabia, but many of these countries, and then you tell me — who's your friend, Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton?’ [NPR, 6/18/2016]\nTrump Spoke To The American Renewal Project, An “Anti-LGBT” Rally Of Over 700 Religious Leaders On The Two-Month Anniversary Of The Pulse Nightclub Shooting.

The American Renewal Project, which is hosting the event, is expecting 700 conservative religious leaders and spouses to attend. Critics are describing the meeting as an “anti-LGBT rally” and criticizing the group for holding it on the two-month anniversary of the mass shooting at Pulse, a gay nightclub in Orlando. Sen.

According to Bloomberg, “Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump overhauled his campaign leadership Wednesday, demoting an operative brought in to professionalize the operation and appointing one known for stoking hardcore conservatives on the web. Stephen K. Bannon, the executive chairman of crusading right-wing site Breitbart News and a former Goldman Sachs banker, was named chief executive of the campaign after former Fox News CEO Roger Ailes, according to a person familiar with the matter, urged that a struggling Trump make dramatic changes. Pollster Kellyanne Conway, who has been working as a senior adviser to Trump since July, was promoted to campaign manager.” [Bloomberg, 8/17/2016]\nBreitbart News’ Bannon Went On An Anti-Transgender Radio Rant Earlier This Year. Bannon criticized retail giant Target’s LGBT-inclusive nondiscrimination policy by pushing an anti-transgender right-wing myth in a May 2 interview on the Breitbart News Daily radio show. Bannon claimed Target’s policy was “trying to exclude people who are decent, hard-working people who don’t want their four-year-old daughter to have to go into a bathroom with a guy with a beard in a dress.” Bannon was hosting well-known anti-LGBT extremist Sandy Rios, who serves as the director of governmental affairs for the American Family Association, an organization designated as a anti-gay “hate group” by the Southern Poverty Law Center. [Right Wing Watch, 5/2/16; Southern Poverty Law Center, accessed 8/17/16]\nPence Lamented The Presence of HIV/AIDS Activists At The 1996 Republican Convention. Twenty years ago, Mike Pence was wishing for a Republican convention that was a bit more, for lack of a better term, Trumpian. Writing in the Indiana Policy Review, a magazine published by a statewide think tank of the same name that he once ran, Pence lamented that the 1996 Republican National Convention had become “an endless line of pro-choice women, AIDS activists, and proponents of Affirmative Action.” Instead, Pence preferred the divisiveness of the GOP convention held four years earlier, when Pat Buchanan delivered his infamous “culture war” speech. He blamed the 1996 event’s relative civility for the drop in television viewership from the previous convention. Pence, now the GOP’s vice presidential nominee, was clearly advocating for a smaller-tent Republican Party, one that would not court African Americans, women or the LGBT community. “Like it or not,” Pence wrote, “traditional Pro-Family conservatives make up the bedrock of modern Republican electoral success.”…It is doubtful that Pence’s objection was to these specific “AIDS activists.” His objection was likely that at the time, HIV/AIDS was still viewed as a gay issue. Pence clearly did not consider LGBT individuals part of the “pro-family” party he envisioned the GOP to be.” [Right Wing Watch, 8/31/2016]\nSignificant Findings on Anti-Bullying and Hate Crimes and Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell\nSaid he was not bothered by the prospect of “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” being repealed.\nSaid the murder of Matthew Shepard was a “hideous crime” and hoped that a hate crimes bill would be passed.\n1999: Trump Said Same-Sex Military Service “Would Not Disturb Me…Hey, I’ve Lived In New York City And Manhattan All My Life, OK?” Asked how he felt about LGBTQ people serving in the military on Meet the Press, Trump said, “It would not disturb me. Again, I'd want to talk to lots of experts within the military. But it's not something that would disturb me. I mean, hey, I lived in New York City and Manhattan all my life, OK? So, you know, my views are a little bit different than if I lived in Iowa, perhaps. But it's not something that would disturb me.” [Meet the Press, 10/24/1999; VIDEO]\nTrump Said The Matthew Shepard Murder “Turned My Stomach” And That It Was A “Hideous Crime.” Asked by The Advocate about the Matthew Shepard murder, Trump said, “It turned my stomach. I have a son who is about the same age as Matthew Shepard and is a student at Wharton. The idea somebody would beat a young man to death just because he is different is almost hard to fathom. I hope that the boy’s death is not in vain and that the public revulsion about this case can be harnessed in a way that prevents this kind of hideous crime from happening again.” [The Advocate, 2/15/2000 ]\nTrump Called For A More Tolerant Society After Murders Of Matthew Shepard And James Byrd In Texas. In an interview with The Advocate, Trump said, “I also want to see a greater atmosphere of tolerance.

We must have a more tolerant society.” [The Advocate, 2/15/2000 ]\nTrump Said He Would “Absolutely” Support Hate Crimes Legislation And One Of His Greatest Disappointments With George W. Bush Was His Failure To Push For A Bill. Asked if Trump would support hate crimes legislation, Trump said: “Absolutely. This is one of my great disappointments with George W. Bush. He had the opportunity in Texas to show national leadership by passing a hate-crimes bill but didn’t—presumably from pressure from the Christian right.

I love people.’” [Huffington Post, 10/1/2015; CNN, 9/30/2015; VIDEO]Trump Criticized Rubio Donor Paul Singer, Saying “When You See See Where He’s Coming From, I Think People Are Going To Say ‘Whoa, We Didn’t Know That.’” According to the Washington Blade, “Trump, who also knocked Jeb Bush for his bungled attempt at using Rubio’s voting record against him in the Republican debate, also made a veiled criticism of GOP donor Paul Singer, who endorsed Rubio over the weekend. ‘If you look at Mr. Singer, you have to see where he’s coming from,’ Trump said. ‘When you see where he’s coming from, I think people are going to say, ‘Whoa, we didn’t know that.'’ Singer is a prominent Republican hedge-fund manager who supported Mitt Romney in 2012. His support is considered a major win for Rubio. But the philanthropist, whose son is gay, also supports LGBTQ rights…..In addition to his support for LGBTQ rights, Singer has supported a version of comprehensive immigration reform that would lead to a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants. Opposition to undocumented immigrants is the most unifying issue in the Republican presidential primary. Never in his remarks did Trump explicitly say why Republicans would be unhappy with Singer. The Trump campaign didn’t immediately respond to the Washington Blade’s request to clarify if where Singer is ‘coming from’ is a reference to his support for LGBTQ rights. The American Unity Fund also didn’t respond to a request to comment on Trump’s remarks.” [Washington Blade, 11/3/2015]\nSignificant Findings on Transgender Equality\nTrump Said “Absolutely Let [The States] Decide” On Laws Like HB 2 And The Federal Government Should Not Be Involved. In an interview with Sean Hannity hours after speaking out against North Carolina’s anti-LGBT law HB 2, asked to explain his position after being attacked by Ted Cruz Trump said: “Well, it is a small number, but we have to take care of everybody, frankly. And North Carolina, which is a great place -- which I won, by the way -- I love North Carolina -- and they have a law and it's a law that, you know, unfortunately, is causing them some problems. And I fully understand that they want to go through (ph), but they are losing business and they are having a lot of people come out against. With me, I look at it differently.

We have bringing trade back. We have rebuilding our military. But I think this. I think that local communities and states should make the decision, and I feel very strongly about that. The federal government should not be involved.” HANNITY: “In other words, let the state decide what local community decides, kind of like your position on education, give it back to the states.” TRUMP: “Yes, let them decide. Absolutely.” [Fox News, Hannity, 4/21/2016; VIDEO]Trump Said he Sided with “the State” and Defended HB2.

            "report_content": "This story was published in partnership with The 19th, a nonprofit, nonpartisan newsroom reporting on gender, politics and policy.\nFor a lot of LGBTQ+ Americans, Joe Biden is the man who fueled the marriage equality movement in its final stretch. His 2012 announcement that he supported same-sex marriage forced President Barack Obama to publicly endorse marriage equality ahead of his reelection campaign. The nation ostensibly followed suit.\nLGBTQ+ rights advocates have hailed the vice president and his running mate, Sen. Kamala Harris, as the “most pro-equality ticket in history.” That’s a stark contrast with President Donald Trump, said Zeke Stokes, former vice president of GLAAD.\n“We’ve seen from Trump more than 175 attacks on our community in policy and rhetoric since he took office, and it literally started on day one when all mentions of LGBTQ people and issues were removed from the White House website,” said Stokes. “We now are going to have to spend an enormous amount of energy reversing the damage that’s been done by this president.”\nIt’s not website updates that have LGBTQ+ leaders concerned, however. Some argue that the president’s anti-LGBTQ+ policies and appointments have set advancements back by more than just his four years in office. And the prospect of a Biden presidency sets up unprecedented challenges and precious opportunity when it comes to LGBTQ+ rights.\nTrump has barred transgender people from openly serving in the military, rolled back protections for trans students, flat-funded HIV/AIDS work globally and pushed for exemptions that would allow health care providers to refuse care to transgender people and those with HIV/AIDS. He barred U.S. embassies from flying pride flags, typically done in June to mark global Pride Month.\nThe Trump administration also outlawed the words “transgender” and “diversity” in Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports, and stopped data collection for LGBTQ+ kids in foster care.\nIn June, the Supreme Court ruled that Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 protected LGBTQ+ workers against discrimination. The ruling is expected to have far-reaching implications beyond the workplace, because it found that sex discrimination includes protections for people who are gay and transgender. However, the Trump administration has largely not enforced the rule.\nIn July, more than 100 members of Congress called on the president to direct federal agencies to review and rescind at least 32 anti-LGBTQ+ regulations and executive orders that hinge on his administration’s understanding that Title VII does not protect LGBTQ+ people.\nIn other words, a Biden administration would have a lot of work ahead just to bring the country in compliance with the law.\nIn March, Biden released a plan to reverse Trump’s anti-LGBTQ+ policies and move the community forward. The plan commits to passing the Equality Act, which would add anti-discrimination protections to the Civil Rights Act of 1964. It also specifically addresses Trump administration policies that LGBTQ+ organizations say are hostile.\nBiden has also pledged to make it easier for trans people to update their government-issued IDs, including obtaining gender-neutral passports. That proposal comes in the wake of a five-year battle between intersex Navy veteran Dana Zzyym and Trump’s Department of Justice, which has repeatedly refused to issue Zzyym a passport with an “X” gender marker, despite court orders.\nBiden has also promised to combat what many say is a crisis of violence facing Black trans women. With two months left to go, more transgender people have been murdered in 2020 than any year in recorded history. Biden also says he will tackle employment and housing discrimination, two critical areas that leave many exposed to violence and survival crimes, advocates say.\nMeanwhile, the Trump administration has actively embraced policies supporting workplace discrimination against LGBTQ+ people. His administration is working toward policy that would allow homeless shelters to turn transgender people away.\nReggie Greer, LGBTQ+ vote director for the Biden campaign, said Biden and Harris are keenly aware of how Trump administration rollbacks have hurt LGBTQ+ people.\n“A Biden-Harris administration will consider every tool available to reverse Trump’s damaging policies and restore and advance critical protections, equality and equity for the LGBTQ+ community,” he said in a statement to The 19th. “When the history books are written, I am certain that advancing LGBTQ+ equality will be one of the Biden-Harris administration’s top achievements.”\nSasha Buchert, a senior attorney at Lambda Legal, said that many anti-LGBTQ+ policies can be quickly reversed. Trump made many changes via executive order. In June, the president signed an order that allows religious government-funded adoption agencies to turn away LGBTQ+ couples. A new president need only write a new order to undo that measure.\nThat, however, won’t fix everything in the eyes of advocates.\nShelby Chestnut, director of policy and programs at the Transgender Law Center, said that work won’t be easy — and some of it may be out of the White House’s control. Emboldened by the administration, states introduced more than 200 anti-LGBTQ+ bills, many of them targeting affirming health care and participation in sports for transgender children.\nIdaho passed two such laws in March — one that barred trans people from updating the gender on their birth certificates and another that banned transgender girls from participating in school athletics with other girls. However, both laws were struck down in the courts. A federal district court in Idaho said that Lambda Legal had already sued and won on behalf of trans clients seeking updated birth certificates, and a federal judge concluded that the state had no interest in barring trans girls from athletics.\nAdvocates warn that other state bills likely would have moved had the pandemic not shuttered legislatures, and they expect to see a resurgence of them in 2021.\n“I think long term, there’s major consequences with the Trump administration, even if Biden and Harris are able to win the White House, the state level attacks that will continue in the ways that those have escalated under Trump,” Chestnut said.\nTrump has appointed more than 200 judges in his presidency, leaving a mark on the judiciary for generations to come. Lambda Legal claims that a third of those judges have a deep history of anti-LGBTQ+ advocacy.\n“We really need to care about courts in the way that the right cares about courts because all of our civil rights, whether it’s LGBT rights, environmental rights, women’s rights, reproductive rights, racial justice, all those issues get decided in the courts, Buchert said.\n“Donald Trump has stacked these courts for four years, including the Supreme Court,” said Stokes. “We’re going to be feeling the results of these four years for a generation in a lot of ways.”",

Asked by Stahl if he personally supports marriage equality, Trump replied, “It’s irrelevant because it was already settled. It’s law. It was settled in the Supreme Court. I mean it’s done.” He went to clarify that even if he were to appoint a judge who opposes marriage equality, the issue has been “settled” and he’s “fine with that.”\nAs for the “fears” that other groups, such as blacks and Muslim Americans, have expressed since his election, Trump told Stahl, “I think it’s horrible if that’s happening.” But in the next breath, he dismissed stories of intimidation as little more than a media invention. “I think it’s built up by the press because, frankly, they’ll take every single little incident that they can find in this country, which could’ve been there before,” he said. “If I weren’t even around doing this, and they’ll make into an event because that’s the way the press is.”",

            "report_content": "This is an article about the social policy of Donald Trump prior to and during his presidency.\nAs of 2016[update], Trump described himself as pro-life with some exceptions: rape, incest, and circumstances endangering the life of the mother.[1] He said he was committed to appointing justices who may overturn the ruling in Roe v. Wade.[2]\nBefore his presidency, Trump made contradictory comments on same-sex marriage.[3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10][11][12][13][14][15][16] Whereas, as a candidate, he largely avoided commenting on LGBT issues, his administration rolled back many LGBT protections.[17]\nTrump supported a broad interpretation of the Second Amendment and said he was opposed to gun control in general,[18][19] although his views have shifted over time.[20]\nTrump supported removing the federal government from determining the legality of recreational marijuana and supported states that have legalized medical marijuana.[21][22]\nHe favored capital punishment[23][24] as well as the use of waterboarding.[25][26]\nTrump has long advocated for capital punishment in the United States.[27] In May 1989, shortly after the Central Park jogger case received widespread media attention, Trump purchased a full-page ad in four New York City newspapers with the title \"BRING BACK THE DEATH PENALTY!\" Five defendants (the \"Central Park Five\") were wrongfully convicted in the case and were subsequently exonerated.[27][24][28][29] By October 2016, Trump still maintained the \"Central Park Five\" were guilty.[30]\nIn December 2015, in a speech accepting the endorsement of the New England Police Benevolent Association, Trump said that \"One of the first things I do [if elected President] in terms of executive order if I win will be to sign a strong, strong statement that will go out to the country, out to the world, that ... anybody killing a police officer—death penalty. It's going to happen, O.K.?\"[31][32][33][23] However, under the current U.S. legal system, these prosecutions usually take place in state court under state law, and the president has no authority over such cases.[27][34] Furthermore, 19 states have abolished the death penalty, and mandatory death sentences are unconstitutional, as held by the Supreme Court in Woodson v. North Carolina (1976).[27][34]\nOn September 3, 2020, Michael Forest Reinoehl—suspected in the killing of a member of a far-right group in Portland, Oregon a week earlier— initiated a shootout with law enforcement which wanted to arrest him; he was fatally shot.[35]  On September 12, Fox News aired an interview in which Trump endorsed the police shooting of Reinoehl. \"There has to be retribution when you have a crime like that,” Trump said, referring to the killing of the far-right activist, a crime for which Reinoehl had not been tried. “This guy was a violent criminal, and the U.S. marshals killed him, and I will tell you something, that’s the way it has to be.\"[36]\nTrump has called for police to arrest those who protest at his rallies, saying that fear of an \"arrest mark\" that would \"ruin the rest of their lives\" would be a deterrent and that then \"we're not going to have any more protesters, folks.\"[37] Geoffrey R. Stone, a professor at the University of Chicago Law School, notes that opponents and disruptive individuals may be removed from Trump rallies consistent with the First Amendment, but opponents have a First Amendment right to protest Trump outside the venue.[38] Stone writes that it is unclear whether it would be consistent with the First Amendment for Trump to \"order the removal of those who oppose his candidacy from his political rallies if he does not announce in advance that they are open only to his supporters\", noting that the answer to this question depends not on the First Amendment, but on the nature of open invitations in the law of trespass.[38]\nTrump has said that if elected, he would loosen defamation laws so that when journalists write \"purposely negative and horrible and false articles, we can sue them and win lots of money.\" The Associated Press reported that this proposal to weaken the First Amendment protections for the press is at odds with \"widely held conceptions of constitutional law\". The Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press and other First Amendment advocates condemned Trump's proposal, which would make it easier to win lawsuits accusing newspapers of libel.[39]\nTrump has expressed support for adopting English-style defamation laws in the U.S.; under UK law, it is easier for plaintiffs to sue newspapers and other media outlets.[40][41] In 2016, the American Bar Association (ABA)'s committee on media law created a report that was critical of Trump's support for expansive defamation laws and his use of libel suits in the past. The committee concluded that Trump was \"a 'libel bully' who had filed many meritless suits attacking his opponents and had never won in court\".[42] The ABA's leadership blocked the report from being issued; the organization did not contest the committee's conclusions, but expressed concern about the possibility of being sued by Trump.[42]\nOn the campaign trail in 2015 and 2016, Trump has frequently \"railed against\" the press, referring to the media as \"the most dishonest people\" and \"absolute scum\".[43] The Trump campaign has barred reporters (from Politico, The New York Times, The Des Moines Register, The Huffington Post, and Univision, among others) from its campaign events, \"often in the wake of critical coverage\".[43] In October 2016, NBC News reportedly held off on airing a video of Trump making lewd and disparaging remarks about women due to concerns that Trump would sue the network.[44]\nAt a rally in June 2020, he said he believed that people who burn the American flag should be jailed for at least a year, though he acknowledged that this would potentially violate \"freedom of speech.\"[45]\nOn National Security Agency (NSA) surveillance, Trump says he \"tends to err on the side of security\" over privacy. Trump supports bringing back now-expired provisions of the Patriot Act to allow for the NSA to collect and store bulk telephone metadata.[46][47] Trump said: \"I assume that when I pick up my telephone, people are listening to my conversations anyway.\"[47]\nIn February 2016, Trump urged his supporters to boycott Apple Inc. unless the company agrees to build a custom backdoor for the FBI to unlock the password-protected iPhone connected to one of the perpetrators of the 2015 San Bernardino shooting, a move that Apple argues would threaten the security and privacy of its users.[48] Trump himself still used his iPhone to send out tweets.[49]\nIn May 2020, Trump reversed his stance, stating that \"warrantless surveillance of Americans is wrong\",[50] and threatening to veto reauthorization of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.[51]\nIn a 1989 interview with Larry King Trump said, \"The problem with our society is the victim has absolutely no rights and the criminal has unbelievable rights\" and that \"maybe hate is what we need if we're gonna get something done.\"[52]\nIn 2016, Trump decried the fact that Ahmad Khan Rahami, a U.S. citizen charged in connection with the bombings in New York and New Jersey, would be provided with medical treatment and the right to counsel, calling this \"sad\".[53][54]\nAt the second presidential debate, which took place in October 2016, Trump said that if he was \"in charge of the law of our country\", rival presidential contender Hillary Clinton would \"be in jail\".[55]\nIn the same debate, Trump also pledged that if elected he would direct his attorney general to appoint a special prosecutor to \"look into\" Clinton.[55] Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook called the remark \"chilling\" and said: \"Trump thinks that the presidency is like some banana republic dictatorship where you can lock up your political opponents.\"[55] The remark was viewed as part of \"a litany of statements [Trump] has made during the campaign that many legal specialists have portrayed as a threat to the rule of law\".[56] The remark was condemned by a number of prominent Republican lawyers, such as Paul K. Charlton, Marc Jimenez, and Peter Zeidenberg,[57] as well as David B. Rivkin and Michael Chertoff.[56] Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway said the \"jail\" comment was merely \"a quip\".[57]\nLater that October, Trump spoke fondly of the \"lock her up\" chants at his rally, saying \"Lock her up is right.\"[58] He also said Clinton's legal representatives \"have to go to jail\".[59] However, in November, after winning the election, Trump told reporters from the New York Times he would not recommend prosecution of Clinton, saying it was \"just not something (he) feel(s) very strongly about\" and suggesting that Clinton had \"suffered greatly\".[60] He repeated this stance in public at a rally in Michigan the following month, responding to \"Lock her up\" chants from the crowd by saying: \"That plays great before the election—now we don't care, right?\"[61]\nIn August 2016, Trump said he \"would be fine\" with trying U.S. citizens accused of terrorism in military tribunals at the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba.[62] Under current federal law (specifically, the Military Commissions Act of 2006), trying U.S. citizens at military commissions is illegal; only \"alien unlawful enemy combatants\" may be tried in such commissions.[62][63]\nIn February 2016, Trump said he approved of the use of waterboarding and \"a hell of a lot worse\".[25] He said that \"torture works\" and called waterboarding a \"minor form\" of torture. Speaking with Sean Hannity on Fox News on January 26, 2017, Trump termed \nwaterboarding \"just short of torture\", and said, \"I will tell you, though, it works. And I just spoke to people who told me it worked, and that's what they do.\" However, he said he would rely on the advice of his defense secretary, James Mattis and others and, \"If they don't wanna do, that's fine. If they do wanna do, then I will work for that end.\"[64]\nTrump opposes same-day voter registration, supports voter identification laws, has asserted that Obama won in 2012 due to voter fraud, has charged that the election system would be rigged against him in the 2016 race, and has equivocated on whether he would accept the outcome of the 2016 election.\nTrump has asserted that America's \"voting system is out of control\", alleging that \"you have people, in my opinion, that are voting many, many times,\" even though the number of cases of voter fraud in the U.S. is minuscule.[65] Trump opposes same-day voter registration, alleging that this allows non-citizens to vote in U.S. elections and that voting laws should prevent people from \"[sneaking] in through the cracks\".[66] PolitiFact ruled Trump's claim about voter fraud false, noting that according to experts, \"there is no additional risk of noncitizens casting ballots in states with same-day voter registration, nor is there any evidence that this occurs.\"[66]\nWhile he has repeatedly charged during his candidacy that the election system is rigged against him, Trump's statements became bolder and more specific in August 2016.[67] He alleged that he would lose Pennsylvania only if \"cheating goes on\", and that voters will cast their ballots \"15 times\" for Clinton without voter ID laws.[67] The Wall Street Journal noted that several voter ID laws have been struck down in several states recently, with courts ruling that they unfairly discriminate against minority voters, and that \"there is no evidence of widespread voter fraud occurring in recent U.S. elections.\"[67] According to Dartmouth political scientist Brendan Nyhan, Trump's rhetoric \"threatens the norms of American elections and could provoke a damaging reaction among his supporters\".[68]\nIn the September 2016 presidential debate, when asked if he would honor the outcome of the election, Trump said he \"absolutely\" would.[69][70] Four days later, Trump appeared to have reconsidered his statement from the debate, saying \"We're going to have to see. We're going to see what happens. We're going to have to see.\"[69][70] In early- and mid-October 2016, Trump repeatedly claimed the election was \"rigged\" and alleged that the media coordinated with the Clinton campaign, citing Alec Baldwin's portrayal of him on Saturday Night Live.[71] In October 2016, after early voting and voting by mail had begun in many states, Trump claimed, without evidence, that the election was being rigged \"at many polling places\".[72][71] That same month, Trump asserted, also without evidence, that the federal government was allowing illegal immigrants to come into the U.S. so they can vote.[73] PolitiFact found Trump's claim of \"large scale voter fraud\" false, giving it a \"Pants-on-fire\" rating.[74]\nTrump has claimed that \"dead people voted for President Obama\" and that \"dead voters ... helped get President Obama elected.\"[75][76] and alleged that voting machines were \"switching\" votes for the Republican nominee, Mitt Romney, to votes for Obama.[77] On election night 2012, Trump expressed skepticism about Obama's victory, saying, among other things, \"This election is a total sham and a travesty. We are not a democracy!\"[78][79][80] Additionally, when it seemed like Mitt Romney may have gained the popular vote but lost the electoral college vote, Trump called the electoral college system \"a disaster for democracy\",[81] calling for \"a revolution in this country\".[77][82]\nSince his election in November 2016—in which he won the electoral college but received 2.8 million fewer votes nationally than Clinton—Trump has repeatedly insisted, without evidence, that he actually won the popular vote if one excludes \"three to five million illegal votes\" cast for his opponent.[83][84] This claim is false.[85] After taking office, Trump said he would launch a major investigation into these unsubstantiated allegations, and appointing his vice president, Mike Pence, to head a White House commission to do so.[86][87] Trump eventually followed through with that promise, announcing the creation of a commission to investigate voter fraud via an executive order on May 11, 2017.[88] On June 29, 2017, the vice-chairman of Trump's voter fraud commission, former Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, instructed the secretaries of state for all 50 states to provide the commission with voter roll data, though most refused to provide some voter information, citing concerns of privacy. This prompted President Trump to remark on Twitter, \"Numerous states are refusing to give information to the very distinguished VOTER FRAUD PANEL. What are they trying to hide?\".[89][90]\nTrump, a self-described Presbyterian who was described by CNN as \"unique among modern American presidents for his seeming lack of deep religious orientation\", has considered the support of evangelical voters as instrumental to his election.[91] In the 2016 election, 81 percent of white evangelicals voted for him.[92]\nTrump attended Marble Collegiate Church, a congregation of the Reformed Church in America, for more than 50 years. In 2015, the church announced that he was not an \"active member\", and Trump acknowledged that he hadn't attended in several years.[93] In a 2011 interview, after Sean Hannity asked, \"How important is your faith?\" Trump replied, \"Very important,\" but he added, \"I'm also busy.\"[94] Trump's third marriage, to Melania Knauss, was performed at Bethesda-by-the-Sea Episcopal Church in 2005.[95]\nHe has vowed to end the Johnson Amendment, an IRS rule that prohibits section 501(c) tax-exempt organizations from endorsing candidates or participating in partisan campaigns.[96][97] He said the rule undermines Christian influence in U.S. politics, adding \"we have more Christians than we have men or women in our country and we don't have a lobby because they're afraid to have a lobby because they don't want to lose their tax status ... So I am going to work like hell to get rid of that prohibition and we're going to have the strongest Christian lobby and it's going to happen.\"[98][99] In his February 2017 address at the National Prayer Breakfast Trump said, \"I will get rid of and totally destroy the Johnson Amendment.\"[100]\nTrump claims that there is discrimination against American Christians. For instance, during his campaign in early 2016, he stated that \"Christianity is under tremendous siege\" and suggested that he would have an easier time banning Christian immigrants than Muslim ones.[101] He suggested that the IRS has targeted him for audit because he is \"a strong Christian\".[102] He has also lent his voice to the claim—originally promulgated in the United States through Fox News commentator Bill O'Reilly in the early 2000s—that there is a \"War on Christmas\" led by department stores that do not use the name of the holiday. During his campaign, Trump promised: \"I'll tell you one thing: I get elected president, we're going to be saying 'Merry Christmas' again. Just remember that.\"[101] Less than nine months after taking office, in the month of October, he declared that \"We're saying 'Merry Christmas' again.\"[103]\nThe Trump travel ban denotes a series of executive actions which restricted entry of travellers from select countries.[104][105] Executive Order 13769 sought to restrict travel from seven countries: Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen. Executive Order 13780 removed Iraq from the list of targeted countries and allowed more exemptions.[106]  Then on September 24, Presidential Proclamation 9645 aimed at more permanently establishing travel restrictions on those countries except Sudan, while adding North Korea and Venezuela which had not previously been included.[107]\nCritics described the order as a \"Muslim ban\" for targeting Muslim-majority countries and prioritizing minority-religion refugees.[108][109][110][111][112][113] President Trump, however, stated that, \"this is not a Muslim ban, as the media is falsely reporting,\" while Rudy Giuliani, who said he helped write the order, called it a legal alternative to a religious ban targeting Muslims.[114][115]\nIn May 2018, John Bolton disbanded the National Security Council's office for pandemic preparation.\nIn January 2020, U.S. intelligence agencies began issuing classified warnings to the Trump administration and to Congress that the novel coronavirus would likely become a pandemic. An anonymous official said: \"They just couldn't get him to do anything about it.\"[116] Amid the coronavirus pandemic, at a press conference on February 26, Trump said that the number of cases \"within a couple of days is going to be down to close to zero\".[117] At that same event, however, Trump implied that the government was assembling a response team. In response to a reporter's question about whether he regretted cuts to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)—during his first two years in office, the CDC workforce had shrunk by five percent—Trump responded: \"Some of the people we cut, they haven't been used for many, many years ... I'm a business person; I don't like having thousands of people around when you don't need them. When we need them, we can get them back very quickly. For instance, we're bringing some people in tomorrow that are already in this great government that we have, and very specifically for this.\"[118][119]\nTrump's proposed 2021 budget includes a $1.9 trillion cut to anticipated future health care spending over the next ten years, including a $920 billion cut to Medicaid and a $451 billion cut to Medicare. The Republicans' idea is to reduce these programs' anticipated annual growth from 5.4 percent to 3.1 percent.[120]\nTrump's proposed 2021 budget would cut 19 percent of the overall CDC budget compared to the previous year.[121]\nIn 2016, The Atlantic asked President-elect Trump his position on embryonic stem-cell research, but his team did not respond with a comment.[122] Trump had not taken a public position on the issue.[123] President Trump selected Dr. Francis Collins, who supports federally funded embryonic stem-cell research, to continue serving as director of the National Institutes of Health.[124] The Trump administration, as of January 19, 2018, and as of September 4, 2020 had not cut funding to embryonic stem-cell research.[125][126]\nIn June 2019, the Trump administration banned federal government scientists from using fetal tissue in research, but the ban does not apply to privately funded research.[127][128] The Trump administration approved new restrictions on federal funding for grants for research by private researchers, but did not ban the research on fetal tissue completely.[129] The Washington Post reported that the new requirements to qualify for federal grants involving research with fetal tissue are difficult to meet.[130] Private funding for research is unaffected.[131]\nTrump's views on drug policy have shifted dramatically over time.[132] At a luncheon hosted by the Miami Herald in April 1990, Trump told a crowd of 700 people that U.S. drug enforcement policy was \"a joke\", and that: \"We're losing badly the war on drugs. You have to legalize drugs to win that war. You have to take the profit away from these drug czars.\"[133][134] In his campaign for the presidency in 2015 and 2016, however, Trump adopted \"drug warrior\" positions[133] and sought advice from William J. Bennett, who served as the U.S. first \"drug czar\" in the 1980s \"and remains a proponent of harsh 1980s-style drug war tactics\".[135]\nTrump stated at CPAC in June 2015 that he \"feel[s] strongly\" opposed to marijuana legalization.[136][133] However, when asked about Colorado (where recreational use of marijuana is legal), Trump softened his previously expressed views and essentially said that states should be able to legalize recreational marijuana.[133][137]\nTrump claims to have never personally used controlled substances.[133]\nTrump has voiced support for medical marijuana,[133] saying he is \"a hundred percent in favor\" because \"I know people that have serious problems ... and ... it really, really does help them.\"[138]\nBefore launching a campaign, and while considering a run for the Presidency in the GOP primary, Donald Trump was invited in 2011 by GOProud, a PAC for LGBT conservatives, to speak at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) and he accepted the invitation, making this his first time speaking at CPAC.[139] During his presidential campaign, Trump largely avoided and did not emphasize issues related to the LGBT community and their rights, and, when asked, he often gave ambiguous answers.[3][140] As a result of this communications strategy, he was often viewed as having a relatively tolerant view of LGBT people compared to other Republican candidates.[3] Rea Carey, the executive director of the National LGBTQ Task Force, described his public statements on LGBT issues during the campaign as \"confusing and conflicting\".[141]\nOn June 13, 2016, Trump gave a speech framed around the threat of \"radical Islamic terrorists,\" referring to a recent mass shooting at Pulse, a gay nightclub in Orlando. He asked rhetorically who LGBT people could count on as a \"friend\": \"Donald Trump with actions or Hillary Clinton with her words?\" Terrorists, he said, \"murder gays. I don’t want them in our country.\" He said that Democratic policies like those of his rival, Clinton, would \"bring people in in vast numbers who reject our values.\" His speech did not propose any domestic policy that would directly help LGBT people.[142][143]\nAlthough he was the first Republican presidential nominee to use the term \"LGBTQ\" in his acceptance speech at the July 2016 Republican National Convention,[144][145][146][147]  this was, again, in the context of mentioning the Orlando shooting; his comment opposed \"the violence and oppression of the hateful foreign ideology\" perpetrated by this \"Islamic terrorist.\" Though he promised to \"protect our LGBTQ citizens\" from this ideological threat, he did not elaborate on any specific challenges faced by LGBTQ people nor did he describe specifically what he would do to support their safety. Consequently, many observed that this comment primarily served to demonize Islam rather than to endorse or meaningfully support LGBT rights.[148][149][150][151][152]\nNine days before the 2016 US presidential election, at a campaign rally in Greeley, Colorado, an audience member presented Trump with a rainbow flag with the handwritten message, \"LGBT for Trump\". Trump held it onstage for a photo opportunity and then handed the flag back to the audience member.[153][154]\nIn an October 1999 appearance on Meet the Press, Trump said gays openly serving in the military was \"not something that would disturb me\".[155]\nIn a February 2000 interview with The Advocate, in response to the murders of Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Trump said he wanted a more \"tolerant society\". He agreed with amending the Civil Rights Act of 1964 for non-discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, and would \"absolutely\" support hate crime legislation covering race, ethnicity, and sexual orientation, notably the Matthew Shepard Act.[156]\nTrump has offered qualified support for the First Amendment Defense Act, which aims to protect those who oppose same-sex marriage based on their religious beliefs from action by the federal government, such as revocation of tax-exempt status, grants, loans, benefits, or employment.[157] Trump said, \"If Congress considers the First Amendment Defense Act a priority, then I will do all I can to make sure it comes to my desk for signatures and enactment.\"[158][159]\nIn April 2015, when asked about the Indiana's Religious Freedom Restoration Act, Trump responded that Indiana Governor (and future running mate) Mike Pence \"didn't do a good job. He wasn't clear in what he said.\" Trump then asserted that religious freedom and nondiscrimination aren't \"mutually exclusive\".[citation needed]\nIn 2000, Trump stated his belief that \"marriage is between a man and a woman.\"[3] Despite this, as a candidate running in the Reform Party in 1999–2000, Trump included support for civil unions in his campaign platform.[4] Trump congratulated singer Elton John on his civil partnership to his same-sex partner in 2005,[160] writing, \"It's a marriage that's going to work ... If two people dig each other, they dig each other.\"[161] Trump did not indicate whether he had changed his political position on marriage or civil unions.\nIn early 2011, Trump told Greta Van Susteren on Fox News, \"I'm probably as conservative as anybody on your show ... I'm Republican, a very conservative Republican ... I'm not in favor of gay marriage.\"[162] A month later, when asked by the Des Moines Register if gay couples should receive the same benefits as married couples, he said his \"attitude on it has not been fully formed\" but then responded simply \"no.\"[8][9]\nAt the beginning of his 2016 presidential campaign, Trump continued to oppose same-sex marriage. In June 2015, when asked about the Obergefell v. Hodges ruling in which the Supreme Court guaranteed the right to same-sex marriage nationwide, he said he personally supported \"traditional marriage\".[10][11][2] He added: \"I would have preferred states, you know, making the decision...But they [the Supreme Court] made the decision ... So, at a certain point you have to be realistic about it.\"[163]\nIn January 2016, when asked about the landmark Supreme Court ruling in Obergefell v. Hodges which had legalized same-sex marriage nationwide, Trump said he would \"strongly consider\" appointing conservative Supreme Court justices who would overturn the ruling, arguing that it was a matter that should be left for states to decide instead.[13][15][164][165][166][167][168] The Advocate, an American LGBT-interest magazine, characterized Trump's proposed Supreme Court nominees as \"LGBT-unfriendly\", noting that \"not all have ruled in LGBT rights cases, but those who have are largely unsympathetic, and some have the backing of anti-LGBT activists.\"[169] A month before the election, Trump wrote to the president of CatholicVote.org to express support for legislation that would protect the religious liberty of Christians who oppose same-sex marriage.[170]\nHowever, in November 2016, a few days after he was elected president, Trump suggested that he did not, after all, plan to nominate justices who would overturn the Obergefell ruling. He told Lesley Stahl on 60 Minutes his personal view on same-sex marriage was \"irrelevant,\" that he was \"fine with\" same-sex marriage, and that the Obergefell decision had \"settled\" the matter[15][16]\nIn 2019, his counselor and spokeswoman Kellyanne Conway claimed that he approves of same-sex marriage.[171]\nFor the 2020 presidential election, the Republican Party did not write a new platform, saying only that they would support Trump's reelection. The existing platform from 2016 had opposed same-sex marriage.[172]\nIn 2012, prior to running for the presidency, Trump called for the exclusion of trans women from beauty pageants. He did not want Jenna Talackova to compete in the Miss USA pageants.[173]\nAt a rally in October 2016, Trump called the open military service of transgender Americans a result of a \"political correct military\". He said he would seek new recommendations from military leaders on the topic of transgender personnel and would \"very strongly\" defer to those recommendations.[174]\nIn April 2016, Trump criticized North Carolina's North Carolina House Bill 2, which eliminated all private employment and public accommodation anti-discrimination laws that were stricter than statewide law and required that, in government buildings, individuals may use only restrooms and changing facilities that correspond to the sex on their birth certificates. The bill was controversial because it prevented transgender people who do not or cannot alter their birth certificates from using the restroom consistent with their gender identity.[175][176][177][178] Trump said: \"North Carolina did something that was very strong and they're paying a big price. ... You leave it the way it is. There have been very few complaints the way it is. People go, they use the bathroom they feel is appropriate, there has been so little trouble, and the problem with what happened in North Carolina is the strife, and the economic punishment that they're taking.\"[179][180] He also said: \"I fully understand if they [North Carolina] want to go through, but they are losing business and they are having a lot of people come out against.\"[181] Later that month, however, Trump expressed the opposite position that states have the right to enact such legislation and that the federal government should not become involved.[182] He did not express an opinion on whether the law was right or wrong.[181] In July 2016, Trump again emphasized a states' rights approach regarding HB2,[183][184] saying, \"The state, they know what's going on, they see what's happening and generally speaking I'm with the state on things like this. I've spoken with your governor, I've spoken with a lot of people and I'm going with the state.\"[182][183]\n\"Minutes after Donald Trump was sworn into office,\" GLAAD says, \"any mention of the LGBTQ community was erased from White House, Department of State, and Department of Labor websites.\"[185] He went on to roll back a number of protections for LGBT individuals, such as those for transgender schoolchildren and transgender members of the military.[186][187] GLAAD identified over 130 anti-LGBT political attacks made by the Trump administration during its first three years.[185]\nOn January 30, 2017, Donald Trump said he would keep in place a 2014 executive order from the Obama administration which created federal workplace protections for LGBT people. The White House released a statement saying the President was \"respectful and supportive of LGBTQ rights\" and noted that he was the first Republican nominee to raise the issue (in his acceptance speech at the 2016 Republican National Convention).[188]\nHowever, in March 2017, the Trump administration rolled back key components of the Obama administration's workplace protections for LGBT people.[189] The Trump administration rescinded requirements that federal contractors prove they are complying with the LGBT workplace protections, which makes it difficult to tell if a contractor had refrained from discriminatory practices against LGBT individuals.[189][190] LGBT advocates have argued that this is a signal that the Trump administration would not enforce workplace violations against LGBT people.[189][190][191]\nOn July 26, 2017, the Department of Justice argued in court that federal civil rights law does not ban employers from discriminating against employees based on sexual orientation. The Obama administration had decided that it did.[192][193] In March 2017, the Trump administration rolled back efforts to collect data on LGBT Americans.[191] The Health and Human Services removed a question about sexual orientation in a survey of the elderly.[191][194] The U.S. Census Bureau, which had planned to ask about sexual orientation and gender identity in the 2020 Census and the American Community Survey, scrapped those plans in March 2017.[195]\nIn 2019, the Trump administration argued to the Supreme Court that Title VII of the Civil Rights Act does not include sexual orientation or gender identity.[196][197] The Trump administration removed the phrase \"sexual orientation\" from anti-discrimination guidelines from the U.S. Department of the Interior.[198][199]\nNear the end of Trump's term, on December 7, 2020, the administration finalized a rule allowing faith-based employers to discriminate against LGBT employees in their contracts with the federal government.[200][201]\nTrump made three Supreme Court nominations:\nBy September 2020, Trump had appointed over 200 federal judges.[207] At least two are openly gay; however, this suggests that LGBTQ judges are underrepresented among his nominees.\nA more significant effect is that one-third of Trump's judicial nominees have anti-LGBTQ history.[213] For example:\nOn January 20, 2017, the day Trump was inaugurated, it was reported that the White House Office of National AIDS Policy (ONAP), formed in 1993, no longer had a webpage.[215] ONAP's director, anticipating that the office might be disbanded, had tweeted farewell two weeks earlier. She asked people to continue following @aidsgov on Twitter,[216] but that Twitter handle no longer exists either.[217] In June 2017, six members of the Presidential Advisory Council on HIV/AIDS (PACHA) resigned, saying the President made their job difficult or pointless.[218] The remaining members of the council were fired in a letter that arrived two days after Christmas.[219] PACHA had no members and no activity throughout 2018, but reconvened in 2019 with new members.\nTrump issued annual proclamations for World AIDS Day in each year of his presidency; none of the four proclamations mentioned LGBT people.[220][221][222][223][224] Similarly, Vice President Mike Pence gave a speech for World AIDS Day 2018 without mentioning LGBT people.[225]\nIn Trump's State of the Union address on February 5, 2019, he devoted a few words to announcing a new program by scientists in the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) that hopes to reduce new HIV infections by 90% in ten years.[226] On May 9, 2019, HHS announced that pharmaceutical company Gilead Sciences would donate pre-exposure prophylaxis medication to prevent HIV infection for up to 200,000 Americans until at least 2025 and possibly 2030.[227]\nTrump's 2019 budget request \"completely eliminates funding for the AIDS Education and Training Centers (AETCs) and Special Projects of National Significance (SPNS), which are both programs run under the auspices of the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program.\"[228]\nTrump's 2020 budget request included $300 million in new funds for HIV programs within the United States. This consisted of $140 million for prevention through the CDC (an increase over the previous year), $70 million for the Ryan White Health Care Program, and $75 million for screenings and prophylactics. In the same budget, Trump sought to reduce funding for HIV research through the NIH and for global programs like PEPFAR, but Congress rejected those cuts.[229]\nTrump's 2021 budget request included $716 million for the second year of HHS's initiative to end HIV in the United States (an increase of $450 million over the program's actual 2020 budget). At the same time, however, it would have cut the overall HHS budget by 9%.[230] Additionally, it would have cut the Housing and Urban Development (HUD) budget by 15%, including cutting Housing Opportunities for People with AIDS (HOPWA) from $410 million in 2020 to $330 million in 2021.[231]\nOn July 26, 2017, Trump announced on Twitter that transgender people would not be allowed to serve in the military \"in any capacity\", saying American forces could not afford the \"tremendous medical costs and disruption\" of transgender service members.[232] However, a RAND study of 18 countries that allow transgender individuals to serve in the military found \"little or no impact on unit cohesion, operational effectiveness, or readiness\".[233] Also, according to the Scientific American, studies have shown that the medical costs for transgender service members would be \"minimal\".[234] Pentagon officials expressed dismay that Trump's tweets could open them up to lawsuits and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff said the policy on who is allowed to serve would not change until the White House sends the Defense Department new rules and the secretary of defense issues new guidelines.[235] On August 25 Trump signed a memo prohibiting transgender individuals from joining the armed services unless the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Homeland Security recommend otherwise. The departments of Defense and Homeland Security are directed to determine what to do about currently serving transgender individuals.[236]\nThe policy change faced legal challenges. Following a challenge in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, on October 30, 2017, Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly blocked enforcement of the ban, writing that as far as could be seen, \"all of the reasons proffered by the president for excluding transgender individuals from the military in this case were not merely unsupported, but were actually contradicted by the studies, conclusions and judgment of the military itself.\"[237][238] In March 2018, Trump announced a new policy on transgender service members, namely a ban on those with a diagnosis of gender dysphoria, which would effectively be a ban on most transgender service members.[239] The new policy was challenged in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington. On April 13, 2018, Judge Marsha J. Pechman blocked enforcement of the policy, ruling that the administration's updated policy essentially repeated the same issues as its predecessor order from 2017, and that transgender service members (and transgender individuals as a class) were a protected class entitled to strict scrutiny of adverse laws (or at worst, a quasi-suspect class), and ordered that matter continue to a full trial hearing on the legality of the proposed policy.[240][241][242][243] On January 21, 2019, the Supreme Court—with Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Clarence Thomas forming the majority for the 5-4 opinion—allowed Trump's policy to go into effect while challenges in lower courts are adjudicated.[244] On March 12, 2019, acting Deputy Defense Secretary David Norquist signed a directive to allow Trump's policy to take effect in 30 days.[245]\nIn February 2017, Trump's Justice Department withdrew a motion that had previously been filed by the Justice Department, \"seeking to allow transgender students in public schools to use the restroom with which they identify\". The move, which occurred within two days of Jeff Sessions becoming U.S. Attorney General, was condemned by the Human Rights Campaign, an LGBT rights advocacy group.[246]\nIn October 2018 it was reported that the Trump administration is considering a definition of a person's gender as based on their genitalia at birth and not changeable later in life, in effect defining transgender out of existence.[247] Responding to protests against the move, Trump said gender issues are in flux and he aims to \"protect the country\".[248]\nOn November 23, 2018, the administration officials removed the Office of Personnel Management guidance intended to protect transitioning employees against adverse actions.[249]\nLady Gaga has called Trump administration's definition of gender as an \"immutable condition\" transphobic.[250][relevant?]\nOn May 24, 2019, the Trump administration proposed a regulation to remove gender identity protections by the Department of Health.[251]\nOn October 12, 2019, Trump spoke at the Values Voters Summit in Washington, D.C. The day had begun with a plenary session that included three speakers on the topic of \"Transgender Movement: Separating Facts from Fiction(s)\". Those speakers were KathyGrace Duncan, identified as a \"transgender survivor\"; Lynn Meagher; and Dr. Andre Van Mol of the American College of Pediatricians.[252]\nOn October 16, 2019, the Justice Department held a ceremony for the 10th anniversary of the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. law against hate crimes. Matthew Shepard's parents were invited but could not attend. A staff member of the Matthew Shepard Foundation read aloud the parents' written statement: \"We find it interesting and hypocritical that he [Attorney General William Barr] would invite us to this event commemorating a hate crime law named after our son and Mr. Byrd, while, at the same time, asking the Supreme Court to allow the legalized firing of transgender employees.\" The audience responded with a standing ovation.[253]\nTrump did not acknowledge LGBT Pride Month in 2017, 2018, or 2020.\nOn May 31, 2019, Trump made a two-tweet statement on Twitter that was reproduced on a government website the next day as a \"Statement from the President\". \"As we celebrate LGBT Pride Month,\" the tweet began, we must \"stand in solidarity with the many LGBT people who live in dozens of countries worldwide that punish, imprison, or even execute individuals on the basis of their sexual orientation.\" He cited his administration's \"global campaign to decriminalize homosexuality\" (a reference to a meeting that had been recently hosted by Ambassador Richard Grenell).[254] It was the first time since taking office that Trump had ever tweeted the acronym \"LGBT,\" and some counted this tweet as an official presidential recognition of Pride Month.[255][256][257] However, Trump's statement had apparently not been coordinated with any LGBT advocacy groups, nor did he attend any Pride events. Days later, the Trump administration mixed its message by ordering U.S. embassies not to fly the Pride flag.[258][259]\nIn 2019, the Trump Make America Great Again Committee began selling \"LGBTQ for Trump\" T-shirts. In 2020, it was instead selling shirts with the slogan \"Make America Great Again\" printed in a rainbow font, which the product description claimed would \"show your support for the LGBT community.\" These shirts fundraise for the Trump campaign, not for LGBT causes.[260]\nOn October 13, 2020, the Trump campaign hosted an event they called \"Trump Pride\" in Newtown Square, Pennsylvania. The event was hosted by Lara Trump (the wife of Donald Trump's son, Eric) and Richard Grenell (the former U.S. ambassador to Germany). Tiffany Trump (Donald Trump's daughter) and Richard Grenell spoke at similar \"Trump Pride\" events in Tampa, Florida later that week and in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania on November 1.[261] The events were branded with the word \"PRIDE\" in rainbow colors. Donald Trump did not appear at these events.[262][263][264] As of October 23, 2020, a \"Trump Pride\" section on Trump's campaign website stated briefly that Trump \"openly support[ed] the LGBT community since his first day in office,\" entered office \"in support of marriage equality,\" made a \"bold plan to end the HIV epidemic,\" and has a \"global campaign to decriminalize homosexuality in the 69 nations where it is illegal.\" No additional policies, details, or statuses were provided on the website. The \"Trump Pride\" co-chairs were named as Richard Grenell, Jill Homan, Charles Moran, and Bill White, and the other 19 advisory board members were Michael Baker, Chris Barron, Martina Bolano, Matthew Craffey, Jamie Ensley, Stephen Gale, Bryan Eure, Dan Innis, Bob Kabel, \"Brokeback Patriot,\" William McLaughlin, \"The Gay Who Strayed,\" Ernest Olivias, Ashton T. Randle, Rebecca Schiff, Shane Shannon, Rob Smith, Andre Soriano, and Ed Williams.[265]\nAfter the LGBT Center in Greenwich Village canceled a planned public event in March 2019 that was to feature three gay men and a transgender woman who had left the Democratic Party and become Trump supporters, one of the men, Brandon Straka, founder of the WalkAway campaign, sued the LGBT Center for $20 million.[266] On the morning of July 14, 2019, Trump tweeted 22 times within 15 minutes in support of Straka.\nOn August 3, 2019, Trump retweeted Robert Jeffress, saying simply that Jeffress and his wife are \"A great couple!\" Jeffress is a Southern Baptist who believes all other religions (including Catholicism[267] and Mormonism) lead to spiritual damnation. He has described gay sexuality as \"miserable\" and \"filthy\", transgender identity as an \"emotional disorder\",[268] sex outside of \"one man and one woman in a marriage\" as \"a deviation from God's original plan\",[269] and support for same-sex marriage as \"paving the way for the Antichrist\".[270]\nRalph Drollinger, a pastor who leads a Bible study group for Trump's Cabinet members (though Trump himself does not attend),[271] wrote on his Capitol Ministries blog on March 21, 2020, that \"a proclivity toward lesbianism and homosexuality indicates an abandonment of God that will provoke God's wrath.\"[272]\nAfter Trump's inauguration, the State Department initially kept U.S. diplomat Randy W. Berry in his position as the State Department's Special Envoy for the Human Rights of LGBTI Persons, a post created in 2015 under the Obama administration. This decision surprised pro-LGBT rights groups such as GLAAD and initially seemed to be a defeat for Christian right groups such as the Family Research Council, which \"implored Trump to launch a major purge of pro-LGBT diplomats inside Foggy Bottom\".[273] However, in November 2017, Berry was reassigned to serve as a \"deputy assistant secretary\" for the State Department's Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor,[274][275] while supposedly the \"role and responsibilities\" of the Special Envoy were being covered by the same bureau's Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Scott Busby. The position of Special Envoy remains vacant as of July 2019. A State Department webpage viewed in March 2019 said \"this position is currently vacant,\"[276] but that URL no longer even indicates there is a position to fill, as it now redirects to an archived page from the Obama administration.[277] In 2018, the Trump administration denied visas to the same-sex partners of foreign diplomats if they were not married and even if they were from countries which recognize only civil partnership or which ban same-sex marriage.[278]\nOn July 8, 2019, the State Department announced the creation of a new commission to examine human rights in foreign policy.[279] The Commission on Unalienable Rights will have eight men and four women.[280] Working off a preliminary list of the expected members of the commission, the LGBTQ rights organization GLAAD found that seven of those people (Mary Ann Glendon, Peter Berkowitz, Hamza Yusuf Hanson, Jacqueline Rivers, Meir Soloveichik, Christopher Tollefsen, and F. Cartwright Weiland) had previously made anti-LGBTQ remarks. The remaining five members were Russell Berman, Paolo Carozza, Kiron Skinner, Katrina Lantos Swett, and David Tse-Chien Pan;[281] however, Skinner left the State Department in August 2019.\nIn November 2019, it was reported that Merritt Corrigan, a former RNC employee who once tweeted that the \"LGBT agenda\" is \"tyrannical\" and that the US was a \"homo-empire,\" had begun a new job at the Hungarian embassy in Washington. She was later made the deputy White House liaison to USAID but lost that job in 2020 after making more anti-LGBTQ tweets.[282][283]\nOn February 13, 2020, journalist Geraldo Rivera asked Trump: \"Would Americans vote for a gay man to be president?\" This was in reference to one of the leading Democratic candidates. Trump paused before responding that Pete Buttigieg's sexual orientation \"doesn't seem to be hurting\" him in the primaries. He pronounced Buttigieg's name with emphasis, adding, \"as you say, as you would call him\". Trump said he would not count himself among Americans who would refuse to vote for someone simply because of their sexual orientation: \"I would not be in that group.\"[284]\nOn November 6, 2021, former President Trump welcomed the Log Cabin Republicans to host their \"Spirit of Lincoln Gala\" at Mar-a-Lago in Florida, and Melania Trump was given the organization's \"Spirit of Lincoln Award\" for supporting the Log Cabin Republicans interests; it was then announced that the organization would partner with the RNC to create the \"RNC Pride Coalition\" to promote outreach to LGBTQ voters.[285]\nTrump signed a pledge in July 2016 that he would work to combat both legal pornography and illegal pornography, such as child pornography. In the pledge, put forth by the anti-pornography group Enough Is Enough, Trump promised to \"give serious consideration to appointing a Presidential Commission to examine the harmful public health impact of Internet pornography on youth, families and the American culture and the prevention of the sexual exploitation of children in the digital age.\" Trump's opponent in the race, Hillary Clinton, wrote a letter of support for the pledge in lieu of signing, citing a campaign policy of abstaining from signing election pledges.[286]\nDonald Trump is consistent in finding no fault on the part of law enforcement when it clashes with racial minorities and in dismissing contrary evidence. In April 2017, Trump was accused of being Islamophobic while presenting Executive Order 13769, which blocked people from seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the United States.[287]\nTrump has criticized the Black Lives Matter movement and accused former President Obama of \"dividing America\".[288] Speaking to Bill O'Reilly during his presidential campaign, Trump said he may direct his Attorney General to look into the Black Lives Matter movement for criminal charges.[289] When asked if he believes there to be a racial divide in America, Trump answered, \"Sadly, there would seem to be ... and it's probably not been much worse at any time.\" When asked if he believes police treat African Americans differently than whites, Trump answered, \"It could be.\"[290] Trump describes the police killings of Alton Sterling and Philando Castile as \"tough to watch\" and criticized the \"terrible, disgusting performance\" by police.[288] Trump said he could relate to the systemic bias African Americans faced against whites, saying, \"even against me the system is rigged when I ran ... for president.\" When asked if he could understand the experience of being African American, Trump replied, \"I would like to say yes, but you really can't unless you are African American. You can't truly understand what's going on unless you are African American. I would like to say yes, however.\"[291]\nOn November 19, 2015, a week after the November 2015 Paris attacks, when asked if he would implement a database system to track Muslims in the United States, Trump said: \"I would certainly implement that. Absolutely. There should be a lot of systems, beyond databases. We should have a lot of systems.\" On November 21, Trump clarified that he does not support any registry of Muslims and that his earlier supportive remarks for surveilling them were due to efforts by news media to entrap him. However, he said he would order \"surveillance of certain mosques\" to combat \"Islamic extremism\",[292][293] alluding to the New York Police Department's use of informants in mosques after the September 11 attacks. Trump also spoke in favor of a database on Syrian refugees without clarifying how it would be different from the records already kept by federal agencies.[292] Trump's support for a database of American Muslims \"drew sharp rebukes from his Republican presidential rivals and disbelief from legal experts\".[294] Trump justified his proposals by repeatedly saying he recalled \"thousands and thousands of people ... cheering\" in Jersey City, New Jersey, when the World Trade Center towers fell.[293][295] PolitiFact noted that this statement was false and gave it a \"Pants on Fire\" rating. It reported that the rating was based on some debunked rumors and also that there were only eight people (suggested by unproven media reports) purported to be seen cheering, as opposed to Trump's claim of \"thousands and thousands\".[296][297][294][298][299] Jersey City Mayor Steve Fulop called Trump's claim \"absurd\" and said Trump \"has memory issues or willfully distorts the truth\".[300]\nIn September 2020, Trump directed federal government agencies to discontinue anti-bias and racial sensitivity training for its employees.[301] Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought said in a memo, Trump instructed him to cancel funding for what it calls \"divisive, anti-American propaganda\". Federal agencies were instructed to \"begin to identify all contracts or other agency spending related to any training on 'critical race theory,' 'white privilege,' or any other training or propaganda effort that teaches or suggests either (1) that the United States is an inherently racist or evil country or (2) that any race or ethnicity is inherently racist or evil.\" Conservative media had criticized critical race theory shortly before the memo was published. Afterward, Trump posted on Twitter that critical race theory was \"a sickness that cannot be allowed to continue.\" He also posted on twitter, \"Not any more!\" in response to a comment that \"critical race theory is the greatest threat to western civilization and it's made its way into the US federal government.\"[302][303][304]\nIn June 2017, the Department of Homeland Security dropped a planned 400,000 dollar grant to \"Life After Hate\", a program which was intended to de-radicalize Neo-Nazis and stop white extremism.[305] The change came following a review of priorities, begun during the Obama administration, with regards to a 10 million dollar DHS umbrella grant program for \"Countering Violent Extremism\".\nIn August 2017, Trump condemned violence \"on many sides\" after a car plowed into counter-protesters during a gathering of hundreds of white nationalists in Charlottesville, Virginia the previous day, on August 12.[306] Trump did not expressly mention Neo-Nazis, white supremacists, the alt-right movement, or counter protesters in his remarks.[307] Whereas Republican and Democratic elected officials condemned the violence and hatred of white nationalists, neo-Nazis and alt-right activists, The New York Times noted that Trump was the only national political figure to spread blame for the \"hatred, bigotry and violence\" that resulted in a death to \"many sides\".[308] Two days later, Trump condemned \"the KKK, neo-Nazis, white supremacists, and other hate groups\".[309] Then the next day, he returned to his initial comments, blaming \"both sides\".[310] Trump came under criticism from world leaders[311] and politicians,[308][307] as well as a variety of religious groups[312] and anti-hate organizations[313] for his remarks, which were seen as muted and equivocal.[308]\nOn March 27, 2020, the Department of the Interior revoked the status of the Mashpee Wampanoag tribe, removing its 321-acre Massachusetts reservation from federal trust. The reservation had been placed into federal trust in 2015.\nThe Mashpee Wampanoag people had proposed running a casino. This casino would have competed for business with two casinos in Rhode Island that have ties to Trump. Those two casinos are owned by Twin River Worldwide Holdings. George Papanier, formerly a finance executive for the Trump Plaza casino hotel in Atlantic City, is Twin River's president. Matt Schlapp, chairman of the Conservative Political Action Committee (and husband of White House strategic communications director Mercedes Schlapp), is a lobbyist for Twin River casinos. In 2019, Trump had opposed legislation to protect the Mashpee Wampanoag land; he called it a \"special interest casino bill\".[314]\nTrump's views on abortion have changed significantly.\nIn 1999, Trump described himself as \"very pro-choice\" and said \"I believe in choice.\"[155] Although he said he hated the \"concept of abortion,\" he said he would not ban it, nor the specific procedure sometimes called \"partial-birth abortion\".[155] That year, he gave interviews describing himself as \"totally pro-choice\" and claiming that abortion should be \"removed from politics. I believe it is a personal decision that should be left to the women and their doctors.\"[315]\nIn his 2016 presidential campaign, by contrast, he described himself as \"pro-life\" (more specifically as \"pro-life with exceptions\"); suggested that women who have abortions should face some sort of punishment (a view he quickly retracted); and pledged to appoint anti-abortion justices to the Supreme Court.[315][316][317][155][318][319][320]\nWhile campaigning for the presidency in 2016 Trump said, \"I'm pro-life and I've been pro-life a long time\" and acknowledged that he had \"evolved\" on the issue.[316] CNN reported that Trump \"dodged questions testing the specificity of those views\".[316] In August 2015, Trump said he supported a government shutdown over federal funding for Planned Parenthood (which receives federal funding for the health services it provides to 2.7 million people annually, but is barred by federal law from using federal funds for abortion-related procedures).[321] In March 2016, Trump said Planned Parenthood should not be funded \"as long as you have the abortion going on\", but he acknowledged that \"Planned Parenthood has done very good work for many, many—for millions of women.\"[322] Planned Parenthood said the \"Trump presidency would be a disaster for women\" and criticized Trump's claim that he would \"be great for women while in the same breath pledging to block them from accessing care at Planned Parenthood.\"[322]\nIn an interview later that month, Trump acknowledged that there must be \"some form\" of punishment for women if abortion were made illegal in the U.S. He issued a statement later that day reversing his position from earlier by saying, \"the doctor or any other person performing this illegal act upon a woman would be held legally responsible, not the woman.\"[319][323][324] Trump has said that abortion should be legal in cases involving \"rape, incest or the life of the mother being at risk\".[317]\nIn May 2016, when asked if he would appoint Supreme Court justices who would overturn Roe v. Wade, Trump said: \"Well, they'll be pro-life. And we'll see about overturning, but I will appoint judges that will be pro-life.\" In the same interview he said of the anti-abortion movement, \"I will protect it, and the biggest way you can protect is through the Supreme Court.\"[318] The Susan B. Anthony List, an anti-abortion feminist group, praised Trump's list of potential Supreme Court nominees as \"exceptionally strong\", while the pro-abortion rights group NARAL Pro-Choice America called the candidates on the list \"a woman's worst nightmare\".[325] Trump has also pledged to sign legislation from Congress banning abortion at the 20-week mark.[326]\nIn his first interview following his designation as president-elect, Trump affirmed his pledge to appoint anti-abortion Supreme Court justices. He said that if Roe v. Wade were overturned, the issue would be returned to the states, and that if some states outlawed abortion, a woman would \"have to go to another state\" to get one.[327]\nOn January 24, days after being sworn in, Trump issued an executive order reinstating the Mexico City policy (also called the \"global gag rule\"). Under the policy, international non-governmental organizations that \"offer or promote abortions as part of their family planning services\" are barred from receiving funds from the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID).[328]\nIn January 2018, Trump spoke at the March for Life in Washington, D.C., becoming the first president to directly address the annual anti-abortion rally, albeit through satellite.[329]\nOn May 3, 2018, he signed an executive order entitled, \"Establishment of a White House Faith and Opportunity Initiative\" that aims to prevent funding for abortion.[330][331]\nOn several occasions Trump has asserted that Democrats advocate \"executing\" newborn babies. In February 2019 he tweeted, \"The Democrat position on abortion is now so extreme that they don't mind executing babies AFTER birth ...\"[332] The assertion became a staple at his rallies, including in April 2019 when he said, \"The baby is born. The mother meets with the doctor. They take care of the baby. They wrap the baby beautifully. And then the doctor and the mother determine whether or not they will execute the baby.\"[333][334][335]\nIn June 2019, the Trump administration was allowed by a federal court of appeals to implement, while legal appeals continue, a policy restricting taxpayer dollars given to family planning facilities through Title X. The policy requires that companies receiving Title X funding must not mention abortion to patients, provide abortion referrals, or share space with abortion providers.[336][337] As a result, Planned Parenthood, which provides Title X birth control services to 1.5 million women, is withdrawing from the program.[338]\nIn October 2015, Trump was cautious regarding paid family leave, as he thought it may adversely impact the country's competitiveness.[339] In September 2016, he announced a policy proposal created in part by his daughter Ivanka, to guarantee six weeks of paid maternity leave to mothers who do not already receive similar benefits from their employers.[340] This policy was the first paid maternity leave plan from a Republican presidential nominee.[341] Trump's proposals were criticized by opponents as hypocritical in light of Trump's previous comments on women,[342] and for being sexist in assuming that women were their children's sole caregivers.[340] Josh Levs in Time magazine wrote that \"Policies that only allow women time off end up hurting women by pushing women to stay home and men to stay at work, reinforcing our anachronistic Mad Men-era work cultures.\"[343]\nIn 2013, Trump questioned the wisdom of allowing women to serve, linking gender-integrated forces with higher rates of sexual assault \"26,000 unreported sexual assaults in the military-only 238 convictions. What did these geniuses expect when they put men & women together?\"[344][345][346][347][348][349] In 2014, Trump said it was \"bedlam\" to bring women into the army.[347] In August 2015, Trump said he would support women in combat roles \"because they're really into it and some of them are really, really good\".[350]\nAccording to the Chicago Tribune, Trump did not address the gender pay gap in his 2016 presidential bid.[351] According to the Tribune, \"Trump's past statements on women in the workplace have included calling pregnancy 'an inconvenience' and telling a voter in New Hampshire last year that women will receive the same pay as men 'if they do as good a job'.\"[351]\nOn March 27, 2017, Trump revoked an executive order from the Obama administration that had been intended to protect women in the workplace. The 2014 Fair Pay and Safe Workplaces order had demanded that companies with federal contracts comply with 14 labor and civil rights laws.[352][353]\nIn August 2017, the Office of Management and Budget under the Trump administration announced that it would end a requirement for companies to collect data about wage gaps.[354] Companies with over 100 employees had been required to collect wage data by gender, race, and ethnicity. The Obama administration had proposed the data collection in 2014 to support the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act,[355] and the new data collection rule had taken effect in 2016.[356]",

I mean, it’s done.”\n“These cases have gone to the Supreme Court. They’ve been settled. And I’m — I’m fine with that,” he added.\nWhen asked if he will appoint a Supreme Court justice who wants to overturn Roe v.

Hodges (which legalized gay marriage nationwide) and United States v. Windsor (which struck down a core component of the Defense of Marriage Act) and supports proposed “religious freedom” legislation that critics say would allow businesses to deny services to LGBT people.\nHis comments about same-sex marriage break with the longtime position of Vice President–elect Mike Pence, who signed a “religious freedom” bill into law in 2015 but walked back some of its language after facing backlash from across the country.\nTrump, who has spent his life in liberal New York City, referred to LGBT Republicans at the Republican National Convention and said during his campaign that transgender people should use whatever bathroom they feel comfortable using.\nDuring the Republican presidential primaries, he said the gay marriage issue should have been left to the states and that he would consider appointing judges to overrule the Supreme Court’s marriage decisions.\n“I would strongly consider that, yes,” he said in a January Fox News interview.\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",

            "report_content": "First published on Mon 14 Nov 2016 00.00 GMT\nPresident-elect Donald Trump sent conflicting messages about his hopes for the supreme court on Sunday, saying he will appoint justices who will send abortion rights “back to the states” but conceding he was “fine” with marriage equality “because it was already settled”.\nTrump made the comments in his first broadcast interview as president-elect, with CBS’s 60 Minutes, which aired on Sunday evening.\nTrump also suggested he might retain parts of Barack Obama’s healthcare reforms, and said that he intends to deport as many as 3 million undocumented migrants with criminal records.\nThe supreme court has had eight members since the death of conservative justice Antonin Scalia in February. Senate Republicans have refused to even consider Obama’s nominee for the seat, Merrick Garland.\nThe vacant seat became a central campaign issue for conservatives, and CBS host Lesley Stahl asked Trump whether he would appoint a supreme court justice who wanted to overturn Roe v Wade, the 1973 case that upheld the right to abortion.\n“So look,” Trump said. “Here’s what’s going to happen. I’m going to – I’m pro-life. The judges will be pro-life.”\nPressed, he said: “Having to do with abortion – if it ever were overturned, it would go back to the states. So it would go back to the states.” That did not mean women would not be able to get an abortion, Trump said, but “they’ll perhaps have to go, they’ll have to go to another state”.\n“Well, we’ll see what happens,” he added. “It’s got a long way to go, just so you understand. That has a long, long way to go.”\nIn March, Trump suggested that women should face “some form of punishment” for having abortions, before reversing and saying states and Congress should lead lawmaking.\nAsked by Stahl whether he supported marriage equality, which was made law by the supreme court in Obergefell v Hodges in 2015, Trump suggested the case did not concern him to the degree of Roe v Wade.\n“It’s irrelevant,” he said, “Because it was already settled. It’s law. It was settled in the supreme court. I mean it’s done.”\nTrump’s vice-presidential pick, Indiana governor Mike Pence, has opposed same-sex marriage throughout his career, and supported so-called “conversion therapy” programs that purport to change people’s sexual orientation.\nPence also signed a religious freedom law that sought to allow people to refuse service to same-sex couples because of religious convictions.\nTrump, however, said he considered the matter resolved. “These cases have gone to the supreme court,” he said. “They’ve been settled. I’m fine with that.”\nHe was adamant, on the other hand, about gun rights, saying he wanted to stack the supreme court with justices that would defend those rights. “Everybody’s talking about the second amendment and they’re trying to dice it up and change it, they’re going to be very pro-second amendment,” Trump said.\nGun advocates last won a major battle in the supreme court in the 2008 case District of Columbia v Heller, which ended with a 5-4 ruling written by Scalia that broadly affirmed the personal right to firearms and overturned a handgun-possession ban in Washington DC.\nTrump discussed a number of another issues in the CBS interview, including the brutal nature of the election campaign.\n“Sometimes you have to be rougher,” he said, discussing his behaviour and choice of words in clashes with opponent Hillary Clinton and exchanges with Barack Obama, whom he met at the White House on Thursday, and wish for conciliation now.\nAsked if he was still planning to appoint a special prosecutor to look into Clinton’s use of a private email server, a threat to which he added possible jail time when he made it in the second debate last month, he said he would “think about it”.\nThe president-elect wanted, he said, to “focus on all of these other things that we’ve been talking about”.",

            "report_content": "LGBTQ people would likely see their rights further chipped away.\nWhile President Trump doesn’t often comment publicly on queer or transgender issues, his administration has been anything but LGBTQ-friendly. Vice President Mike Pence has a long record of anti-LGBTQ lawmaking and rhetoric, and LGBTQ advocates have already called the Republican Party platform — a holdover from 2016, as the GOP did not write one for 2020 — one of the most anti-LGBTQ in the party’s history. A second Trump term could further turn the clock back for LGBTQ people.\nTrans people have been a target of the Trump administration from the get-go. Almost immediately after Trump took office in 2017, the administration rolled back an Obama-era memo directing schools to protect trans students from discrimination. That July, Trump announced his decision to ban trans people from serving in the military. In May 2018, the administration went after trans prisoners, too, deciding that, in most cases, trans people should be housed according to their assigned sex at birth. This summer, the Department of Housing and Urban Development proposed a rule that would allow homeless shelters that receive federal funding to house trans people according to their birth-assigned sex.\nQueer people have also been under attack. Though marriage equality is the law of the land, the White House has taken steps to limit or undo gay rights in several key policy areas such as lobbying to give religious adoption agencies the right to refuse same-sex couples. Most critical, perhaps, was the administration’s attack on the Affordable Care Act’s LGBTQ nondiscrimination protections in a rule released on June 12. Though it has been put on hold due to a federal court stay, the rule would allow doctors and insurance companies to refuse care to LGBTQ people.\nMeanwhile, Trump has nominated three conservative Supreme Court justices during his presidency, but in a surprising turn of events, a recent major LGBTQ victory threw the administration for a loop: The Supreme Court decided in June that LGBTQ people are protected on the basis of sex under Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act. The decision in Bostock v. Clayton County means that queer and trans people cannot be fired for being LGBTQ, and the ruling could end up as precedent for expanding rights into other issue areas such as education and health care.\nStill, this likely won’t stop conservatives from trying to whittle away and build in carveouts to the legal protections LGBTQ people currently have. It would be similar to the approach taken by religious conservatives with regard to Roe v. Wade — passing anti-abortion legislation at the state level in the hope that related cases work their way back to the Supreme Court, especially now that it looks like Trump pick Amy Coney Barrett is about to be confirmed.\nAccording to activists, conservatives will likely try to attack across three different fronts in their efforts to chip away at LGBTQ rights: by continuing to reshape the courts, by attacking health care access, and by continuing to limit immigration and asylum by LGBTQ people fleeing violence in other countries.\nIf elected president, former Vice President Joe Biden has promised to immediately reverse the military ban and reissue an Obama-era guideline allowing trans students to use the correct bathroom. This would effectively end litigation in the military ban cases and change the complexion of the bathroom cases.\nHowever, a second Trump term would mean more anti-LGBTQ federal judges appointed, a Supreme Court justice (maybe even two), and an escalation in the legal arguments against trans rights, legal advocates say.\nThe bulk of Trump’s anti-LGBTQ actions have come through administrative rules, most of which have been challenged in federal court. Because of this, Trump’s control over federal policy has been solidified by appointing conservative judges. As of July, 194 of the 792 active federal judges were appointed by Trump — that’s a quarter of the federal judiciary — according to Pew Research data. Many of them were either previously anti-LGBTQ activists or who openly express anti-LGBTQ sentiments.\nSeveral have already had an impact on pending legal battles. Earlier this year, Fifth Circuit Judge Kyle Duncan infamously ruled that it is necessary for a court to misgender a trans plaintiff whose case he was overseeing, a decision not in line with precedents in other federal courts.\nAnd right now, there are several legal cases snaking their way through the federal court system that could end badly for LGBTQ people if put in front of a Trump-appointed judge. These include several lawsuits against the transgender military ban, student suits seeking access to school bathrooms according to their gender identity, and California v. Texas, which is set to decide whether religious entities can legally deny adoption services to gay parents. It will be heard by the court on November 4, just a day after Election Day.\nThese cases could eventually land in front of the Supreme Court, which is its own issue, now that Republicans in the Senate are all but set to confirm conservative Judge Amy Coney Barrett to the Court upon Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s death.\n“Certainly, at least one more Supreme Court appointment would inflict devastating damage on the transgender community that would last for decades to come,” Shannon Minter, an attorney at the National Center for Lesbian Rights, told Vox in August. “It would be something close to closing the courtroom doors on our foreseeable future.”\nOne way for conservatives to somewhat relitigate and chip away at even landmark decisions is through a change in legal strategy. Throughout its first term, the Trump administration argued in court that trans people are not and should not be protected under current sex discrimination laws. This was the basis for several administrative rules rolling back the rights of trans people in health care, in homeless shelters, and in education. However, Bostock turned that argument on its head.\nAccording to Chase Strangio, an attorney at the American Civil Liberties Union, the administration has now begun to argue more explicitly that federal sex discrimination law protects cis people from sharing spaces with trans people. It’s a similar tack to the fringe argument that anti-LGBTQ legal groups have long tried — that cis people have a constitutional right not to share locker rooms, bathrooms, and other gendered spaces with trans people.\nFor example, in a statement to the court in a case challenging Connecticut’s school sports transgender inclusion policy earlier this year, the administration argued that trans people are not protected under Title IX, which protects people on the basis of sex in education. In a more recent post-Bostock filing in a nearly identical case challenging Idaho’s ban on trans girls participating in girls’ school sports, the administration took a different angle, arguing that Title IX entitles cisgender people protection from sharing spaces and activities with trans people. That policy shift, Strangio told Vox, would be a scary portent for a second Trump term.\nBecause everything is interconnected, the key to making Trump’s strategy work, say Minter and Strangio, would be more Trump appointees to the already Trump-stacked federal judiciary. The lower court judges would have significant power to shape LGBTQ cases as they move through the federal court system.\n“My greatest fear is for a judicial action that locates [anti-trans] rights in the Constitution that we couldn’t undo with a new president in the future,” said Strangio. “You get some horrible constitutional ruling that then authorizes discrimination in a host of contexts because trans people are so abhorrent that you have a constitutional right not to share space with them.”\nEven before the pandemic, health care was going to loom large over this election cycle. Republicans in Congress have repeatedly tried to repeal the Affordable Care Act during Trump’s term. The administration even submitted a brief to the Supreme Court recently arguing that the law should be thrown out.\nThe ACA was a landmark piece of health care legislation for Americans — particularly so for LGBTQ people. Under an HHS rule established by the Obama administration in 2016, the bill banned health care discrimination against LGBTQ people, but just as key for queer communities were protections for coverage of preexisting conditions. Before the law was passed, anyone diagnosed with gender dysphoria or HIV/AIDS could legally be excluded from health insurance coverage, and transition care could be legally excluded from any insurance plans.\n“I can’t think of a more important issue for transgender people than access to health care, because if we’re not able to access transition-related care, it’s just impossible to have a meaningful, authentic life,” said Minter.\nShould the administration succeed at the Supreme Court in California v. Texas, slated to be heard this fall, people could again be subject to wholesale exclusion from insurance coverage. But even if the law is preserved in some form, the administration has already worked to limit LGBTQ access to health care.\nIn mid-June, just days before the Bostock decision came down, the administration finalized a rule clarifying that LGBTQ people are not entitled to sex-based protections under the ACA, effectively rolling back the Obama-era rule saying the opposite. The rule, as written, would allow insurance companies to once again have blanket exclusions on coverage of transition-related procedures and they could once again deny coverage of health care that doesn’t comport to a person’s legal gender, meaning a trans man could be denied coverage for gynecological care.\nThe rule would also have had a significant impact on lesbian, gay, and bisexual cisgender people in the US by allowing doctors, health care providers, and insurance companies to deny care or coverage to cis queer people.\n“We know LGBTQ people face discrimination in health care,” David Stacy, who leads the federal policy team at the Human Rights Campaign, told Vox. “It can be overt discrimination, but it can also be more subtle discrimination.”\nIn August, however, a federal judge issued a stay on the rule’s implementation while the case is litigated, saying that the rule likely violates Bostock and that HHS failed to reconsider this after the Supreme Court’s decision.\nBut despite the stay, there are still potential avenues a second-term Trump administration could take to attack trans health care access in particular. Minter suggested that, depending on the makeup of Congress, the administration could take steps to ban transition-related care from Medicaid coverage, try to reinstate a Medicare exclusion that existed prior to 2016, or even try to institute a Food and Drug Administration ban on puberty blockers for trans adolescents. The administration could also use executive action to end transition care offered through Veterans Affairs.\n“They’ll try to cut off access to health care for trans people any way they can,” said Minter. “They can do a lot of damage on the health care front. It would be, in my opinion, probably the single most devastating impact on the trans community.”\nLGBTQ issues like health care and the military ban frequently take center stage when discussing the administration’s record, but perhaps nothing is as life and death for queer and trans people as immigration and asylum policies.\nIn late 2018, 31-year-old trans woman Camila Díaz Córdova fled her native El Salvador, fearing for her life. She reportedly made her way to the US with a migrant caravan and attempted to apply for asylum, only to be denied and deported back to her home country. In late January 2019, she was murdered by three police officers.\nIt’s a problem that will likely only worsen in a Trump second term. “The rules of asylum are completely changing,” Bamby Salcedo, founder of the Trans Latina Coalition, told Vox. “Through that process, a lot of people are being excluded. This is something that will definitely impact trans women.”\nOver the last three and a half years, the Trump administration has made it increasingly difficult for those fleeing gender-based violence to obtain asylum in the United States. In November 2018, Trump tightened immigration rules which restricted asylum to anyone who first passed through Mexico to arrive at the US southern border. And this June, the Department of Homeland Security proposed a new rule that would allow immigration officials to dismiss asylum seekers’ applications as “frivolous” without a hearing.\nAs explained by Vox’s Nicole Narea, the proposed rule is part of a larger election-year push against immigration in general. Using the pandemic as an excuse, Trump has closed the border with Mexico, started quickly deporting asylum seekers who show up at the southern border, and issued a temporary ban on issuing new green cards.\nAll of these restrictions come at a real cost for trans people, especially trans women, in Central America. There is an epidemic of violence against trans women of color throughout the Americas, but it is acutely felt in Central America. According to a report by Trans Murder Monitoring, at least 258 trans or gender-diverse people were murdered in Latin America between October 2018 and September 2019.\n“The new asylum regulations that Trump has already proposed, if they were finalized, it will be devastating for LGBT asylum seekers. And they’ll effectively just shut the door to asylum,” said Minter.\nThe public comment period ended on July 15 and the rule could be finalized before Election Day. However, should Democrats retake the Senate and White House, they’ll be able to override any administration rules issued within 60 legislative days of the new Congress taking office via the Congressional Review Act.\nSalcedo said that the possibility that Biden could win the presidency gives her hope — not just for the immigration and asylum system, but that other trans-related policies could improve in short order. “I am hopeful that, you know, the new administration will revert all of those policies that have attempted to come into effect,” she said. “I’m hopeful that there’s tangible and institutional changes that are going to happen. And I firmly believe that that could become a reality.”\nNew goal: 25,000\nIn the spring, we launched a program asking readers for financial contributions to help keep Vox free for everyone, and last week, we set a goal of reaching 20,000 contributors.

            "report_content": "Politics\nThe Republican Party has moved on from one of the most seminal culture war debates, even as evangelicals fume.\nAt the GOP convention in 2016, Trump became the first Republican to mention protecting the rights of LGBTQ citizens. | Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\nBy  MERIDITH MCGRAW\n08/16/2021 04:30 AM EDT\nLink Copied\nTo mark the beginning of Pride Month this year, Republican National Committee chair Ronna McDaniel did what party leaders do on these types of occasions: She sent out a tweet.\n“Happy #PrideMonth!” she wrote, “@GOP is proud to have doubled our LGBTQ support over the last 4 years, and we will continue to grow our big tent by supporting measures that promote fairness and balance protections for LGBTQ Americans and those with deeply held religious beliefs.”\nInside the RNC, the missive barely registered. McDaniel, after all, had sent out a similar message in years past.\nBut outside the building, those 265 characters prompted immediate backlash. Not just from Democrats, who accused her of disingenuousness, but from social conservatives too who furiously dialed up McDaniel with complaints. Tony Perkins, leader of the Family Research Council, lambasted her in a scathing blog post and even encouraged people not to donate to the RNC. But the attacks, particularly from the evangelical right, were met with a shrug by the party.\nMcDaniel’s willingness to brush aside complaints would have been unthinkable not too long ago, Republicans say. The evangelical right remains the most committed part of the party, and the Family Research Council leader is among its most powerful figures. But the GOP has, in recent years, undergone a quiet but consequential evolution: Party leaders still exhibit strong opposition to transgender rights and the top legislative priorities of the LGBTQ community. But on the most prominent battlefield of the past few decades, same-sex marriage, they’ve all but conceded defeat.\nIn interviews with Republican operatives, former Trump administration officials, and conservative leaders, there is a widespread acceptance that debate over marriage equality is settled. There is no serious discussion about trying to overturn Obergefell v. Hodges, the landmark Supreme Court case that ruled states are required by law to recognize the marriage of same-sex couples. There were openly gay officials working at the highest levels of the Trump administration. And in Congress, the gay rights movement has found allies in up and coming Republican stars like Rep. Dan Crenshaw (R-Texas), Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.), and Rep. Young Kim (R-Calif.).\nIn this image from video, Rep. Dan Crenshaw (R-Texas) speaks from Houston, during the third night of the Republican National Convention on Wednesday, Aug. 26, 2020. | Courtesy of the Committee on Arrangements for the 2020 Republican National Committee via AP\n“There is Republican support for LGBTQ issues. There is more energy in the GOP for help for gay and transgender issues than a lot of issues Biden cares about,” said Tyler Deaton, a Republican consultant and senior adviser to the American Unity Fund, which works to advance LGBTQ rights.\nThe Republican Party was a late arrival to this point. While much of the country grew to accept same-sex marriage well in advance of the Supreme Court recognizing it in 2013, GOP voters didn’t. A Gallup poll from 2014 showed only 30 percent of Republican voters in support.\nThere have been moments over the past 20 years, however, when prominent conservatives warned Republican party leaders they were dramatically out of step with the public as a whole on the issue. Ken Mehlman, who managed George W. Bush’s 2004 presidential run, apologized for the anti-same-sex marriage rhetoric of that campaign and for his role in fighting marriage equality, while announcing that he was gay. One of the founding members of the Federalist Society, conservative attorney Ted Olson, joined forces with David Boies, a Democratic attorney, to overturn Proposition 8, California’s ban on same-sex marriage. Hedge fund billionaire and Republican donor Paul Singer quietly donated to pro-gay rights causes and formed the American Unity PAC and American Unity Fund, which fights for LGBTQ and religious freedom. And former Vice President Dick Cheney was famously at odds with President Bush over same-sex marriage and became a supporter of the movement. His daughter, Mary Cheney, has been married to her wife since 2012.\nThe real breakthrough, gay Republican operatives say, came with the nomination of Donald Trump. Though evangelicals flocked to his candidacy, conservative gay rights activists also saw an opportunity. A cosmopolitan minded business person, Trump did not prioritize LGBTQ issues during his campaign and, in fact, made overt appeals to gay voters, though not by pledging support for laws to protect them.\n“For the first time we got to walk into the race with a candidate we didn’t have to apologize for or explain away his reluctance to embrace the gay community. Probably Reagan was the last candidate where we were like ‘this candidate has gay friends,’” said Charles Moran, spokesperson for Log Cabin Republicans, a LGBTQ GOP group. He worked closely with the Trump campaign on increasing LGBTQ engagement, and Log Cabin Republicans plans to hold their annual event this year at Mar-a-Lago, with a member of the Trump family (perhaps the former president himself) likely to be the headliner.\nAt the GOP convention in 2016, Trump became the first Republican to mention protecting the rights of LGBTQ citizens, and in a post-election interview with “60 Minutes” echoed what was becoming the mainstream view on same-sex marriage. “It’s law. It was settled in the Supreme Court. I mean, it’s done,” Trump said.\nA Gallup poll released earlier this year showed that by June 2021, 55 percent of Republicans supported same-sex marriage.\nGay rights activists and Republicans acknowledge there is still much work to be done within the GOP. For now, the official Republican party platform, unchanged since 2016, includes language defining marriage as being between a man and a woman, and gives what some say is a nod to the controversial practice of conversion therapy. Gay rights advocates in the party said Republicans missed an opportunity to change the platform’s text in 2020. Had the platform committee convened, a group of Republicans planned to ensure specific changes related to LGBTQ rights were amended.\n“There is an appetite to change it but people actually have to get on the platform committee to do it and not enough people know how the process works,” said one Republican official. “Otherwise, the far right people get on and people are like, ‘Well why does the platform say that?’ There will be a concerted effort next time in 2024. A more vamped up effort of what was going to happen in 2020.”\nDeaton said his group, the American Unity Fund, will continue to advocate for changes to the GOP platform.\n“We brought a lot of attention to the weaknesses of the platform, the mean-spirited language of the platform and it doesn’t reflect the party. It reflects a few dozen people who show up at the convention and try to run the platform committee. And we’re not going to let them do that forever,” Deaton said.\nWhile Trump may have ushered in a wave of acceptance among conservatives for the cause of same-sex marriage, his actual record on LGBTQ issues was mixed at best, experts say. His administration committed to ending the HIV/AIDS epidemic within 10 years and pushed to decriminalize homosexuality abroad. Trump mentioned his position in a speech to the United Nations (something President Barack Obama had done before).\nFormer U.S. President Barack Obama speaks during a drive-in campaign rally for Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden at Northwestern High School on Oct. 31, 2020 in Flint, Mich. | Drew Angerer/Getty Images\n“Donald Trump's embrace of people who are LGBT truly did help make it OK to be an out, gay Republican,” said former White House deputy press secretary Judd Deere. “As president, he hired and promoted LGBT Americans to the highest levels of government, including positions at the White House, of which I was honored to be one of those people, Cabinet agencies, including the first openly gay Cabinet member, and ambassadorships.”\nBut Trump also opposed the Equality Act — which would amend the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to prohibit anti-LGBTQ and sex discrimination in public accommodations and federal programs — appointed judges deemed hostile to LGBTQ issues, rolled back protections in the workplace for non-binary workers, and pushed for the removal of protections for LGBTQ people in healthcare programs.\nKasey Suffredini, the CEO and National Campaign Director for Freedom For All Americans, a bipartisan campaign for LGBTQ nondiscriminiation protections, said his organization sees the potential for Republican senators to support the Equality Act and has been encouraged by LGBTQ protections in the Republican-backed Fairness For All Act, which works to protect religious freedoms and LGBTQ rights.\n“It’s clear where the country is on this issue and where it is headed on this issue,” Suffredini said.\nBut on transgender rights issues in particular, fierce opposition within GOP ranks persists. The Trump-era Education Department eliminated guidance that sought to extend protections around the treatment of transgender students. And Trump himself issued an executive order, via tweet, prohibiting transgender individuals from serving in the military — a move later overturned by President Joe Biden.\nPotential 2024 candidates like Nikki Haley and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis have backed laws that would ban transgender athletes from participating in sports consistent with their gender identity. And while McDaniel has hailed Pride Month, she’s also slammed the Biden administration’s use of the term “birthing person” instead of “mother.” According to the Human Rights Campaign, the nation’s largest LGBTQ advocacy group, 2021 was a record year for anti-transgender legislation with dozens of laws introduced in Republican legislatures across the country placing restrictions on transgender people.\nNikki Haley speaks. | John Lamparski/Getty Images\nPerhaps the best illustration of the GOP’s evolution on LGBTQ issues — and the crossroads at which it now finds itself — has come in the form of Caitlyn Jenner’s run for California governor as part of the recall election of Gavin Newsom. Jenner, who came out as transgender six years ago, said she opposes “biological boys who are trans competing in girls' sports in school,” even as she has tried to be a kind of ambassador for transgender people and the Republican Party. One Trump adviser, former campaign manager Brad Parscale, is working for her. Another, Trump’s former election lawyer Jenna Ellis, has publicly criticized her for being transgender.\n“I think even with Christians the gay [marriage] issue, that ship has sailed. But the trans issue is different,” said one Trump adviser.\nLink Copied\n© 2021 POLITICO LLC",

            "report_content": "To revisit this article, select My Account, then View saved stories\nTo revisit this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories\nBy Isaac Chotiner\nIn his new book, “The Engagement: America’s Quarter-Century Struggle Over Same-Sex Marriage,” the journalist Sasha Issenberg chronicles one of our country’s most recent civil-rights battles, tracing the evolution of the cause from 1990, when it started to become a political movement, to its ratification by the Supreme Court, in 2015. Issenberg’s subjects are the activists, politicians, and judicial figures who, intentionally or not, found themselves at its forefront. That gay marriage would become legal after only a twenty-five-year fight, Issenberg writes, “was beyond the wildest hopes of gay-rights activists just years before.” The book attempts to explain why this campaign succeeded so quickly and how religious conservatives inadvertently furthered a cause they passionately opposed.\nI recently spoke by phone with Issenberg, who has previously written about the science behind political campaigns and elections. During our conversation, which has been edited for length and clarity, we discussed what made the struggle for gay marriage distinct from other civil-rights movements, how Trump’s election shifted the focus of social conservatism away from sexual politics, and what this fight can tell us about future civil-rights battles.\nHow is the struggle for gay marriage in America different from other struggles for civil rights in American history?\nI think the obvious things that we want to compare it to are the movements for racial equality and for women’s rights. And one essential element is that, unlike race and gender, people generally have the ability to control the circumstances under which they acknowledge and disclose the fact that they are gay or lesbian. And so the process of coming out, which is the underlying social engine of a lot of the opinion change that leads to political and legal victories, is something that’s available to members of the gay and lesbian community that is not available to African-Americans or to women, in their causes.\nAnd I still can’t decide whether this is a profound observation or a banal one, but most gay people are born to straight people—which means that they are, one presumes, evenly distributed across the population, which is to say that they’re not geographically concentrated, that the likelihood of anybody in the country coming to know somebody as a neighbor or a family member or a classmate who’s gay or lesbian is probably more or less equally distributed. And we’ve seen across gay-rights issues, not just marriage, that the best predictor of liberal attitudes has always been how somebody answers the question “Do you have a friend, family member, or co-worker who’s gay or lesbian?”\nWhat does your first observation—that people can choose when they come out—mean in practice?\nThat people get some degree of cultural or social acceptance, then feel comfortable coming out, and then the people around them recognize that they know somebody who’s gay or lesbian. I think it’s less likely that you’re, like, “Oh, voilà, my neighbor’s Black.” Or, “I just learned that my kid’s schoolteacher’s a woman. Now I’m going to revisit how I think about issues that pertain to them.” One of the things that make it very easy for people to grow more liberal on the marriage question—as basically forty per cent of the American population has, over a generation—is that it doesn’t ask the majority to give up much to the minority, which has been a central source of political friction around a lot of other civil-rights or social-justice movements.\nYou decided to cover both activists and big political actors like the Supreme Court. Was there a reason you felt you had to do the inside struggle and the outside struggle?\nYeah. I mean, I think that this is someplace where writing about marriage is different than writing about the entirety of the gay-rights movement. There was a much longer period of the broader quest for equal rights for gays and lesbians, when activists were operating without much acknowledgment from, reaction from, and interaction with the political class or institutions. And so I think when people have written histories of gay activism in the nineteen-fifties or sixties or seventies, there are far fewer politicians or judges in there. The story I tell starts in 1990. And at that point there was hardly anybody who was an activist for same-sex-marriage rights. No significant gay-rights group in the country had endorsed marriage as an objective. And it ended up in the hands of the Hawaii Supreme Court. And, by 1996, this was in front of Congress and the President. Marriage was an issue that made the jump. Activists did not spend decades toiling in obscurity at the periphery of our politics trying to get people to pay attention to this. It landed in the laps of powerful people pretty quickly after it emerged as a kind of viable policy objective.\nThe way we normally tell stories about civil rights in this country is that there’s a push for civil rights, and then there’s a reactionary backlash to that—which has effects of its own. But one of the interesting things about your book, I thought, was that in a way you’re saying that the backlash to gay marriage helped the gay-marriage cause, or pushed it along. And the normal story we tell is reversed in some way.\nYeah. So, this big victory at the Hawaii Supreme Court leads to the Defense of Marriage Act, which is clearly a form of backlash against this significant, but local, victory in Hawaii. Then all of a sudden Congress and the President are preëmptively defining marriage for one of the first times in federal law. And we see a slight hit to the polling support for gay marriage. Something similar happens in 2003 after the Massachusetts Supreme Court rules in favor of marriage: public opinion dips again, and you get an active push for a federal marriage amendment eventually supported by the Bush White House, and a blossoming of the state-level constitutional bans. And I think you can look at what happened in California in 2008, where the California Supreme Court orders that same-sex couples have the right to marry and, within six months, Proposition 8 has passed at the ballot box, taking away that right.\nSo there were examples of backlash all over this story, but, over the longer arc of this, the backlash ended up proving counterproductive. So, in the mid-nineteen-nineties, anti-gay activists on the mainland who respond to this court decision in Hawaii end up unifying a gay-rights movement that had been uninvested in marriage as a cause and fractured ideologically over it as a strategic proposition—over the trade-offs, in terms of incremental gains that would have to be put aside in the quest for marriage rights. And, all of a sudden, some  gay-rights activists who had been principled opponents of seeking marriage decide that, because their opponents want to deny them that right, they feel basically obliged to fight for it.\nIt’s not a bad argument, right? It’s, like, people want to take something away from you, you should damn well want to fight for it.\nYeah. It’s also the nature of coalition politics. And gays and lesbians and bisexuals and transgender people were in a coalition, and their opponents decided that what was within that coalition had been a niche issue but was now going to be the primary area in which they were going to fight. They basically ended up inadvertently baiting the whole coalition into defending something they hadn’t wanted to defend. Then the level at which this conflict could be resolved changed.\nAnd that’s because marriage had been, with very few exceptions in American history—like when Congress banned polygamy, or when the Supreme Court overturned state laws banning interracial marriage—something that had been left to the states. And there’s a counterfactual where, if conservatives had not nationalized this issue, it would have played out very slowly, state by state. This goes from being a question that could have played out in fifty state judiciaries and state legislatures, and instead becomes something that nine Justices can rule on. And it takes a while to see it, but that ends up being a huge strategic miscue by same-sex-marriage opponents that makes it really easy for same-sex-marriage supporters to win nationally.\nThe marriage movement advanced a fairly conservative objective—and did so in the midst of the AIDS crisis. I know that the idea split more radical activists, such as Larry Kramer, whom you describe as an early supporter of marriage equality. How did divides in the gay-rights movement manifest themselves in the marriage fight?\nThere were definitely cleavages within the movement over marriage. To the extent that people were debating same-sex marriage in the nineteen-eighties, it was a circle of gay and lesbian lawyers and legal theorists. The folks doing what we would call L.G.B.T. family law then were at the time overwhelmingly lesbian lawyers representing lesbian clients, who were usually women who had had children in a heterosexual marriage, come out of the closet, left their husbands, and had to go to court to fight for their own biological children. And some of those lawyers had gone to college and law school and been shaped by second-wave feminism, and they saw marriage as an institution that was established to subjugate women. And so there was this critique of marriage as an essentially patriarchal, heteronormative institution.\nThe objective for many of these family-law types was a legal regime that valued what they called multiple families—which was to say, a legal regime in which the law treated equally a broad spectrum of familial arrangements, so not just pairings of any gender combination but single parents and unmarried people cohabitating, and communal living, and they saw the goal of gay and lesbian families as opening up the range of relationships the government recognized.\nAnd there was also a related but separate push, which grew out of the liberationist impulses of gay politics in the nineteen-seventies—which argued that gays and lesbians had adopted their own sexual values and mores, and it would be fundamentally regressive to make a political goal in seeking acceptance in what they saw as this middle-class, American institution, and the goal of gays and lesbians should be to remake relationships in their own image, and not demand acceptance or assimilation.\nHow central was the AIDS movement to these cleavages?\nIt magnified the extent to which gays and lesbians were themselves a political coalition. AIDS was overwhelmingly a problem for men in the nineteen-eighties more than women. Gay men were instantly forced to deal with all of these death issues that had not really been present—and certainly not part of the gay political agenda. “Can I visit my partner in the hospital?” “What happens to my property when I die?” That was not something lesbians were facing in the same way. But a lot of lesbians were focussed on these life questions. A lot of them had had children in heterosexual marriages, and had to fight to adopt their own children, and saw that the courts held their sexuality against them. And so, as the nineteen-eighties ended, they had divergent sets of material concerns involving the law.\nThere is an important case that goes to the New York Court of Appeals called Braschi, where two men were living in a rent-stabilized apartment: one of them dies, almost certainly of AIDS, and the landlord tries to evict the surviving partner,  and they challenge it under New York’s stabilization statute, and the court rules that two men who live together qualify as close family members. That was a concern that was clearly motivated by AIDS that would not have been a legal cause years earlier.\nI think, generally, when people think of the struggle for gay marriage, they often think about the relative speed with which it was accomplished compared with other struggles in American history. Do you think that can be replicated in other movements?\nI think there are certainly some structural, tactical decisions that same-sex-marriage supporters made that helped lead them to victory. And that, broadly, there are lessons that other campaigners or social movements can adopt. But the idea that there’s a kind of off-the-shelf manual for twenty-five years of social change. . . .\nOne important thing is there’s an organization called Freedom to Marry, which was a single-issue campaign organization with one goal: equal marriage rights across fifty states and the District of Columbia. And, up until this point, the major players in L.G.B.T. politics, the Human Rights Campaign, the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force, and a lot of state-level organizations, have a really broad panoply of issues that they are invested in. They represent a coalition that is fairly broad, basically sexual minorities, and have a whole lot of issues that they’re working on: they’re trying to stop hate crimes, they’re trying to get recognition for families, they’re trying to allow gays and lesbians to serve in the military, a whole bunch of things. It’s been a recurring trope among gay-rights activists that the Human Rights Campaign, the most wealthy and prominent of the gay-rights groups, is too focussed on the inside game, too focussed on winning access, raising money. Some activists believe that the gay-rights movement as a whole did not fight strongly enough against the Defense of Marriage Act or against the federal marriage amendment because the Human Rights Campaign wasn’t ready to fight and that this was evidence of their accommodationist sort of approach to politics.\nIt’s clear that the H.R.C. was always acting, I think, quite rationally, in that they had had a broad set of issues that they cared about, and they intended to use influence in Washington institutions to get it. And they had to weigh the merits of fighting over marriage with the merits of trying to get progress on other issues. When Freedom to Marry comes along, they don’t have to make those compromises. And so they are able to develop a strategy that’s not based on trade-offs between “If we push for marriage in this state, will it step back our efforts to get a nondiscrimination ordinance passed?”  And Freedom to Marry said, “We’re going to put ourselves out of business after we meet our goal,” which they did after the Supreme Court ruled in 2015. And that is not the way that most interest groups are set up. They’re set up basically to perpetuate themselves. And that means that they are having to weigh not just their policy objectives, but their donors and their members and their long-term stability.\nAnd I think it raises a lot of questions. Where would gun laws be if, instead of having these broad gun-control organizations, a group is focussed solely on background checks?\nProbably the same place, but your point may still be correct.\nYeah. But I think that the natural physics of interest-group politics and coalitions is to make them bigger. And if you really are focussed on one discrete policy objective, the bigness and broadness of those groups can be self-defeating.\nWell, this also goes to your earlier point, that the religious right did the cause of gay rights a favor by making it more about one specific thing.\nYeah. They helped set up the terms of a debate, and then, later, gay-rights activists with big donors built an infrastructure that could fight the conflict on those terms.\nWe were talking about backlash earlier, and you mention near the end of the book that a backlash to gay marriage hasn’t really happened in the way one often expects. How do you understand that?\nI think there are a few elements here. One is that anti-gay activists were not surprised when the Obergefell decision came down in 2015. It looked almost fated, based on the court’s earlier ruling and the way that it had handled appeals to circuit-court decisions. So I don’t think that there was the emotional letdown on the day of the decision that would’ve galvanized some opposition. And, because of that, many of those activists had already begun to move to an area where they still had strength, where the public opinion looked a lot more like it did around gay marriage twenty years ago—which is trans issues. And so they basically said, “We have lost the gay-marriage fight, but we have this nearby place where we can manufacture conflict from a position of strength.” And many of the same institutions that had been fighting over gay marriage all of a sudden just started fighting over issues related to transgender people.\nThat was going to be my next question—to what degree is it a coincidence that trans issues have become more prominent in the past five years?\nThere was all this capacity that had been built. I mean, part of the story of how we ended up fighting about gay marriage in the nineteen-nineties is that the gay-rights movement and the religious right grew up more or less in parallel in the late seventies and became professionalized and well funded through the eighties. By the nineties, the gay-rights movement was a central part of the Democratic-left coalition, and the religious right was a central player in Republican politics. And they had developed capacity for conflict. They were basically on a collision course. And the only question was: What were they going to fight over? And this popped up on the radar as the thing that they started to fight over.\nI think what happened twenty years later, around the time of the 2015 Supreme Court ruling, was that these coalitions were bigger and stronger in many respects, more entrenched, and still needed something to fight over. Religious conservatives had lost their position of strength for a variety of reasons—opinion change, demographic changes. And then they decided that they were going to go to trans issues instead.\nThe other part of it is the cosmology of religious conservatives shifted with the defeat over same-sex marriage, where they may have ceded the broader culture wars. There’s a reason Jerry Falwell called his organization the Moral Majority. The kind of motivating conceit of religious-conservative activism through the eighties and nineties, and much of the two-thousands, was based on the idea that there’s a Judeo-Christian majority in the country and the laws of the United States should reflect its values. And losing the conflict over gay marriage, I think, persuaded many of those religious conservatives that they were not, in fact, the majority—that now you don’t have to watch more than ten minutes of Fox News to understand that the cosmology of the current American right is that they are a besieged minority, under siege by the courts, and academia, and Hollywood. And, once they began to think of themselves as a besieged minority, they started doing what besieged minorities do in our constitutional system, which is to ask the courts for protection. And that takes the form of these religious-liberty exemptions, which is basically an acknowledgment of the concession of defeat in the broader struggle.\nThe third part of the puzzle is Donald Trump. In June, 2015, these two things happened. June 16th is when Donald Trump announces his campaign for President. On the 26th of June, the Obergefell decision comes down. If you had told me in advance that a major civil-rights decision was going to land that overturned state laws that had been democratically enacted by the residents of Alabama in the same month that one of the most talented demagogues in American history was going to announce his campaign for President, I would have assumed that those two things would become interrelated in some really dangerous, scary ways, and they didn’t.\nDonald Trump had an instinct and a tremendous gift for pitting Americans against one another, and he decides he’s going to run for President and talk about Mexicans and Muslims and women and immigrants, but he has no natural bile for gays and lesbians. There are a lot of ways in which his Administration later set back gay rights, but he did not want to talk about those issues. I think, just given the way that that primary played out, candidates like Ted Cruz or Rick Santorum or Mike Huckabee or Bobby Jindal—who otherwise would have been highly inclined to cheerlead a backlash to marriage since the Obergefell decision—recognized pretty quickly that that’s not where the news was in the summer of 2015.\nYou wrote an op-ed last weekend in the Times which was headlined “Cancel Culture Works: We Wouldn’t Have Marriage Equality Without It.” For the book, you went back and looked at the different ways that gay-rights organizations and gay-rights activists shamed, shunned, and boycotted opponents of same-sex marriage. Do you feel that you’re seeing some of the same tactics that are today labelled “cancel culture,” or do you feel like those activists avoided what critics of cancel culture find so damaging today?\nYeah. Well, I’m glad we’re not going to have a conversation about what cancel culture means or doesn’t, because I actually don’t really know. I think that one of the big changes that take place in the marriage debate is how the money dynamic shifts in the years between 2008, when gay-marriage supporters suffered this massive setback when Proposition 8 passed in California, and four years later, in 2012, the first time they sweep four ballot measures. One of the big things is the extent to which the pro-gay-marriage side of the debate opened up a major financial advantage over opponents. You had a cluster of exceedingly wealthy gay donors, mostly gay white men who had made their money through tech or inherited it, who in the two-thousands had become uniquely interested in marriage among all the issues on the agenda. By 2012, Mike Bloomberg was giving major contributions. Jeff Bezos was giving major contributions.  You had a whole lot of Wall Street donors, including Republicans, who were giving generously as well.\nThe other thing that’s happening is big donors basically abandon the other side of the fight: by 2012, it’s clear that the folks running the effort to ban same-sex marriage are just having trouble going to their normal donors, including archdioceses. There’s something about being associated with this issue that people don’t want to deal with, in terms of media scrutiny and acceptance among their peers in the business world. I think so often this cancel-culture conversation is played out over the propriety of it, or the place of these tactics in a liberal democracy, and here’s this really important recent case study that shows it actually works. Scaring away propositions’ financial backers through shame is something that can have a dramatic effect on the trajectory of a particular political debate, and the Internet has made it much easier for individuals to launch and organize these types of attacks.\nBy signing up, you agree to our User Agreement and Privacy Policy & Cookie Statement.\nSections\nMore\n© 2021 Condé Nast.

Anyone can read what you share.\nBy Maggie Haberman\n[Follow our daily updates on the latest presidential election polls.]\nThe month of June was filled with big moments for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people.\nIn that monthlong stretch, the Supreme Court rendered a sweeping decision providing workplace protections for gay and transgender people. It came shortly before the fifth anniversary of the high court’s landmark ruling on marriage equality. L.G.B.T.Q. people and others commemorated the murder of 49 people at the Pulse nightclub in Florida in June 2016. Thousands marched in Brooklyn, N.Y., in support of Black transgender lives.\nPresident Trump was almost entirely silent through it all.\nThere was no tweet in honor of Pride Month, despite suggestions from several aides to Mr. Trump that he write one. No rollout of a coalition aimed at L.G.B.T.Q. voters by his campaign, despite preparations that had been made for one. Embassies overseas were told they couldn’t fly the Pride flag.\nThere was, however, a rollback by the Trump administration of a regulation put in place by the Obama administration in 2016 to mandate health care as a civil right for transgender patients under the Affordable Care Act.\nIt is what many in the L.G.B.T.Q. coalition have come to expect from Mr. Trump, who during his 2016 presidential campaign used gay people as a wedge against Muslims, whom he painted broadly as extremists, following the shootings at Orlando’s Pulse nightclub by a Muslim man. While Mr. Trump has signaled a willingness to publicly align himself with some gay men and women, he selected a deeply conservative running mate in Vice President Mike Pence, and, as president, has systematically dismantled protections implemented by President Barack Obama, especially for transgender people.\nJust over two months before Election Day, Mr. Trump is trailing in almost every poll to Joseph R. Biden Jr., the Democratic nominee, whom activists credit with pushing Mr. Obama to support gay marriage. And Mr. Trump’s advisers are suddenly talking about L.G.B.T.Q. people as they scramble to find new voter support.\nLast weekend, the campaign announced the L.G.B.T.Q. coalition that had been expected in June, blaming the delay on the coronavirus.\nAnd now Trump officials are turning to Richard Grenell, the openly gay former U.S. ambassador to Germany who served for three months as the acting director of national intelligence, to sell the president, and to attack Mr. Biden.\nMr. Grenell, whom Mr. Trump likes in part because he declassified material related to the investigation into whether the Trump campaign conspired with Russian officials in 2016, appeared in a video released by the Log Cabin Republicans, a group that “represents L.G.B.T. conservatives.” Mr. Grenell, whose praise for Mr. Trump and criticisms of Mr. Biden’s record were deemed dishonest by the Washington Post fact checker, is expected to speak at the Republican National Convention on Wednesday night.\nAlphonso David, the president of the Human Rights Campaign, the largest L.G.B.T.Q. civil rights group, responded, “We’re not taking the bait.”\nFor years, now, Mr. David said, the president has tried to divide the coalition by targeting transgender people in particular, with actions that affect the entire coalition.\n“The Trump administration is looking to drive a wedge within the L.G.B.T.Q. community between L.G.B. and T.,” Mr. David said.\nTori Cooper, the group’s director of community engagement for the transgender justice initiative, said that the administration in is especially focused on people who have the least protection in society, transgender people of color.\n“It shows the cowardice — that’s the word I like to use of the current president,” Ms. Cooper said.\nThe targeting of transgender people has extended across the federal government: a ban on transgender service in the military, an effort at the Education Department to block transgender students from choosing which bathroom to use, the rollback of health care protections by the Department of Health and Human Services, the Justice Department’s move to end protections for transgender people in federal prisons.\nLast month, the Department of Housing and Urban Development proposed allowing homeless shelters to deny transgender people access to single-sex shelters, and this month, the Education Department’s office of civil rights publicly moved to block transgender girls from joining female track teams in Connecticut high schools.\nMr. Grenell, in the video, cited almost no specific domestic policy accomplishment that Mr. Trump achieved on L.G.B.T.Q. rights, as he made the pitch that Mr. Trump is the “most pro-gay president in American history.” Instead, Mr. Grenell referred to his own appointment, as well as to the president’s acceptance of the Supreme Court’s ruling of gay marriage as constitutional and his efforts to push countries that criminalize being gay to end those practices. In the video, Mr. Grenell specifically mentioned gays and lesbians, but not transgender people.\nAnd the night before Mr. Grenell’s scheduled speech, a convention speaker praised Mr. Trump for his administration’s revocation of some protections for transgender students.\nTo describe Mr. Trump as supportive of gay people because he appointed Mr. Grenell is the essence of “tokenism,” Mr. David said.\n“It’s actually offensive,” he said, “because you are appointing someone but removing all the rights associated with that identity.”\nSome administration officials have acknowledged that they see targeting transgender rights as different from gay rights.\nIn a statement, Judd Deere, a White House spokesman, said, “While the radical left has pushed false and disgusting accusations that L.G.B.T. Americans, which includes me, are threatened under this administration, that could not be further from the truth.”\nMr. Judd said that Mr. Trump has hired L.G.B.T.Q. people across the government, mentioning Mr. Grenell again, cited the president’s commitment at last year’s State of the Union address to ending H.I.V. transmissions in the country by 2030, and saying the president “launched a global campaign to decriminalize homosexuality, standing in solidarity with all L.G.B.T. people who live in dozens of counties around the globe that punish, imprison and even execute individuals based on their sexual orientation.”\nThere’s no evidence that Mr. Trump’s campaign to decriminalize homosexuality has had any impact, or that it’s been substantially different than what Mr. Obama had attempted. For instance, White House officials declined to say whether Mr. Trump had raised the brutal anti-gay purges by the Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, with whom he’s spoken several times in recent months. His H.I.V. pledge was similarly met with skepticism.\nMr. Trump is famously transactional, and the support he has given L.G.B.T.Q. people has usually been in connection with celebrity or support they have given him.\nMr. Trump allowed gay members into his Florida club Mar-a-Lago as long as they could pay the exorbitant membership fee; he broadcast donations to groups like the Gay Men’s Health Crisis when the AIDS epidemic became a celebrity cause; and he publicly embraced the civil union between the singer Elton John, someone whose music and fame Mr. Trump admires, and Mr. John’s longtime partner, David Furnish.\nIn 2015, when Mr. Trump was just a few months into the Republican primary contest, some of his advisers discussed a plan for exiting the campaign if his poll numbers dropped. The plan, according to one person with direct knowledge of the discussions, was for Mr. Trump to say that the party did not agree with him on a number of issues, including gay marriage, even though he’d never publicly supported it.\nBut after Mr. Trump won the New Hampshire primary, his advisers knew he needed the support of evangelical voters. So in an interview with the former Fox News host Bill O’Reilly in 2016, Mr. Trump said, “I take a lot of heat because I come from New York. You know, from New York, it’s like, how you can be against gay marriage? But I’m opposed to gay marriage.”\nChristine Quinn, the first openly gay speaker of the New York City Council, said Mr. Trump’s New York business background makes his actions as president “worse — because he knows better.”\nAs president, Mr. Trump has not demagogued L.G.B.T.Q. issues the way he has with immigrants, Muslims and Black people protesting systemic police brutality.\nBut Mr. Trump’s embrace of initiatives promoting religious freedom has been used by people inside and outside his government to justify discrimination against gay and transgender people.\nOver many years, Mr. Trump has been skeptical about whether he gets any political benefit from the L.G.B.T.Q. community, turning frequently to Mr. Pence, who was Mr. Trump’s bridge to evangelical voters in 2016, for advice, according to administration officials. Those are the voters Mr. Trump is most anxious about losing.\nCharles Moran, a spokesman for the Log Cabin Republicans, conceded that he would have preferred that Mr. Trump acknowledge Pride Month in June. But he maintained that the president is being treated unfairly and said that Mr. Obama’s pro-L.G.B.T.Q. regulations were legal overreach.\n“The L.G.B.T. left and what I call ‘Gay Inc.’ has hijacked the narrative,” Mr. Moran said, adding that he himself had to get educated quickly on transgender-related issues. He accused groups like the Human Rights Campaign of being unwilling to engage with the White House.\n“My phone calls get returned” by the White House, he said. “There is a genuine willingness to work with us in our community.”\nThe Log Cabin Republicans did not endorse Mr. Trump in 2016, and the group’s current support has caused a rift within its ranks. Jerri Ann Henry, the group’s first woman executive director, resigned in August 2019 over the pending endorsement.\n“Ultimately what should be promised is not devotion to a specific class or group of people but dedication to the set of principles,” she said, “and Trump has not shown his devotion to that set of principles.”\nLast month, Mr. Trump was questioned about whether he would consider rescinding his ban on transgender people entering the military by a reporter for The Washington Blade, a gay newspaper.\nMr. Trump gestured to his chin, appearing to signal the reporter’s mask was muffling him.\n“I can’t hear you,” Mr. Trump said. “I can’t hear a word you’re saying.” He never answered the question.\nAdvertisement",

get married and then have kids,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.\nBut it took eight years and a landmark U.S. Supreme Court decision in 2015 before the country recognized their union.\n“It was like a burden had been lifted,” recalled Phillip Borski, adding that for years, both men feared their parental rights over their three children could be taken away. “We didn’t have to worry about our family.”\nOn Friday, the LGBT+ community will celebrate five years since that historic decision, but with a sharp conservative turn in U.S. politics, some gay and lesbian couples are worried for the future of hard fought gains such as gay marriage.\n“It scares me,” said Greg, of the country’s rightward shift. “There’s always this pushback - they’re slowly chipping away at our rights, a little here, a little there.”\nEver since the election of U.S. President Donald Trump in 2016, LGBT+ rights have come under increasing pressure through both executive order and legal challenge.\nIn 2017, Trump announced a ban on transgender people serving in the military, and this month, rescinded Obama-era guidelines protecting trans people from healthcare discrimination.\n“We have an administration...that is trying to turn back the clock, ” said Stan Sloan, chief executive of Family Equality, a U.S.-based LGBT+ rights group.\nThe Trump administration also argued against extending workplace protections to LGBT+ people, a challenge denied by the Supreme Court’s historic decision last week ruling that federal law protected gay and trans people from discrimination at work.\nBut despite this, gay and lesbian families, as well as LGBT+ activists, worry that same-sex marriage could become a target.\n“We both still live in that fearful place,” said Cheralyn Stevenson, who has been with her wife Stacey for 14 years. “It doesn’t matter to us that we’re married…(it) can still be ripped away from us at any time.”\n‘SKIM MILK MARRIAGE’\nWhile an outright dismissal of same-sex marriage is considered highly unlikely, legal experts say decisions at state level and in the lower courts, many filled with Trump-appointed judges, could erode protections for gay couples.\n“The greatest fear is having what Justice (Ruth Bader) Ginsberg calls ‘skim milk marriage,’” said Sarah Warbelow, legal director at LGBT+ advocacy group the Human Rights Campaign.\n“You have the ability to marry but your rights and benefits and obligations within that marriage don’t look the same.\n“That’s a very real fear,” she said.\nSince the historic 2015 ruling, nearly 300,000 gay and lesbian couples have wed, boosting state and local economies by an estimated $3.8 billion, according to the Williams Institute, a think tank at the University of California.\nSupport for same-sex marriage has also increased, with more than six in 10 Americans in favor, according to the Public Religion Research Institute (PRRI), against just 36% in 2007.\nBut approval remains divided across party lines, with nearly three-quarters of Democrats and two-thirds of independents favoring same-sex marriage, versus 47% of Republicans, according to the PRRI’s research.\nFor the 2020 election, the Republican Party has adopted the same platform as it did for 2016, backing “traditional marriage and family, based on marriage between one man and one woman”.\nAnd despite the Supreme Court ruling, most states continue to carry gay marriage bans on the books, with Republicans in states such as Florida and Indiana blocking attempts to strike down the outdated and ineffectual bans.\n‘KEEP UP THE FIGHT’\nMeanwhile, the issue of whether religious groups should be able to refuse to serve gay and lesbian couples because of spiritual beliefs has come up several times in federal court.\nIn 2018, the Supreme Court sided with a baker who declined to make a wedding cake for a same-sex couple, saying it would violate his Christian beliefs.\nDuring its next session, the Court will also hear a dispute over the city of Philadelphia’s refusal to place children with a Catholic agency that bars gay and lesbian couples from fostering.\nEven in its latest ruling on workplace discrimination, Justice Neil Gorsuch, a Trump appointee, noted that the Court was “deeply concerned with preserving the promise of the free exercise of religion enshrined in our Constitution.”\n“The smaller decisions that are being made...under the guise of religious liberty, every one of those chips away at our marriages,” said Sloan, from Family Equality.\n“Even though they may still be legal, they don’t have the same protections, and they don’t have the same equality that heterosexual marriage does,” he said.\nIt’s this fear of going back to second-class citizenship that has made Stacey and Cheralyn determined to speak out.\nBefore gay marriage was legal, Cheralyn went to court to adopt Stacey’s last name: the judge was ruling mostly on divorce cases, she said, taking 30 seconds with the divorcing couples, whereas she was interrogated for 10 minutes.\n“I called Stacey crying, I was hysterical,” she recalled. “You’re giving out divorces like hotcakes, with no questions asked... I’m given the 10th degree like I’m a criminal.”\nAs for Greg and Phillip, their 11-year-old daughter has become an outspoken advocates for LGBT+ rights, and they’re hopeful others will follow her example.\n“We hope the younger generation will not take it for granted,” said Greg. “You gotta keep up the fight.”\nReporting by Oscar Lopez @oscarlopezgib; editing by Lyndsay Griffiths.

            "report_content": "As vice president in 2012, Joe Biden endeared himself to many LGBTQ Americans by endorsing same-sex marriage even before his boss, President Barack Obama.\nNow, as president-elect, Biden is making sweeping promises to LGBTQ activists, proposing to carry out virtually every major proposal on their wish lists. Among them: Lifting the Trump administration’s near-total ban on military service for transgender people, barring federal contractors from anti-LGBTQ job discrimination, and creating high-level LGBTQ-rights positions at the State Department, the National Security Council and other federal agencies.\nIn many cases the measures would reverse executive actions by President Donald Trump, whose administration took numerous steps to weaken protections for transgender people and create more leeway for discrimination against LGBTQ people, ostensibly based on religious grounds.\nIn a policy document, the Biden campaign said Trump and Vice President Mike Pence “have given hate against LGBTQ+ individuals safe harbor and rolled back critical protections.”\nBeyond executive actions he can take unilaterally, Biden says his top legislative priority for LGBTQ issues is the Equality Act, passed by the House of Representatives last year but stalled in the Senate. It would extend to all 50 states the comprehensive anti-bias protections already afforded to LGBTQ people in 21 mostly Democratic-governed states, covering such sectors as housing, public accommodations and public services.\nBiden says he wants the act to become law within 100 days of taking office, but its future remains uncertain. Assuming the bill passes again in the House, it would need support from several Republicans in the Senate, even if the Democrats gain control by winning two runoff races in Georgia. For now, Susan Collins of Maine is the only GOP co-sponsor in the Senate.\nCritics, including prominent religious conservatives, say the bill raises religious freedom concerns and could require some faith-based organizations to operate against their beliefs.\nThe Equality Act “is a dangerous game changer” in its potential federal threat to religious liberty, said the Rev. Albert Mohler, president of the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary in Louisville, Kentucky.\nRep. Chris Stewart, a Utah Republican, tried to strike a compromise last year that would have expanded LGBTQ rights nationwide while allowing exemptions for religious groups to act on beliefs that could exclude LGBTQ people. His proposal won support from The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and the Seventh-day Adventist Church but was panned by liberal and civil rights groups.\n“Anti-equality forces are trying to use the framework of religious liberty to strip away individual rights,” said Alphonso David, president of the Human Rights Campaign, a national LGBTQ-rights organization.\nAmong the actions that Biden pledges to take unilaterally, scrapping Trump’s transgender military ban would be among the most notable.\nJennifer Levi, a Massachusetts-based transgender-rights lawyer, said it’s clear Biden has the authority to do so after taking office.\nNicolas Talbott, a transgender man whom Levi has represented in a lawsuit seeking to overturn the ban, called that “a huge relief.”\n“I look forward to being allowed to re-enroll in ROTC so I can continue to train, keep up my fitness to serve, and become the best Army officer I can possibly be,” Talbott said via email.\nSome of Biden’s other promises:\n— Appoint an array of LGBTQ people to federal government positions. There’s wide expectation that Biden will nominate an LGBTQ person to a Cabinet post, with former presidential contender Pete Buttigieg among the possibilities.\n— Reverse Trump administration policies carving out religious exemptions allowing discrimination against LGBTQ people by social service agencies, health care providers, adoption and foster care agencies and other entities.\n— Reinstate Obama administration guidance directing public schools to allow transgender students to access bathrooms, locker rooms and sports teams in accordance with their gender identity. The Trump administration revoked this guidance.\n— Allocate federal resources to help curtail violence against transgender people, particularly transgender women of color. Rights groups say at least 38 transgender or gender-nonconforming people have been killed in the U.S. this year.\n— Support legislative efforts to ban so-called conversion therapy for LGBTQ minors.\n— Bolster federal efforts to collect comprehensive data about LGBTQ people in the U.S. by adding questions about sexual orientation and gender identity to national surveys.\n— Ensure that LGBTQ rights are a priority for U.S. foreign policy and be prepared to use pressure tactics, including sanctions, against foreign governments violating those rights.\nWhatever happens in Washington, some activists worry that Republican-controlled state legislatures may push anti-LGBTQ bills, such as curtailing the ability of transgender youth to access certain medical treatments or participate in school sports. They are also concerned that an influx of conservative federal judges appointed by Trump might lead to rulings allowing religious exemptions.\nEarlier this month the Supreme Court — now with a solid conservative majority — heard arguments on whether a Catholic social services agency in Philadelphia should be able to turn away same-sex couples who want to be foster parents, while still receiving local government funding.\nTim Schultz, a religious freedom advocate, outlined two potential paths for the debate over the Equality Act: “ongoing legislative gridlock, regulatory trench warfare and judicial decisions, which will happen independently of what the president does,” or active engagement by Biden for a new strategy that can win bipartisan support in the Senate.\nThe first path would provide only “temporary satisfaction,” given that regulatory moves can be undone by future presidents, said Schultz, president of the nonprofit 1st Amendment Partnership.\nNathan Diament, executive director of the Orthodox Union Advocacy Center, cited Biden’s campaign-trail appeals for unity — and his commitment to faith outreach — as positive signs for more engagement on the issue next year.\n“He and his team will be very well-positioned to broker compromise if they want to, to get this done,” said Diament, who has advised both the Trump and Obama administrations.\n___\nAssociated Press religion coverage receives support from the Lilly Endowment through the Religion News Foundation.

Or at least it was.\nBut in Virginia, Glenn Youngkin, the Republican nominee for governor, says he’s personally against same-sex marriage. He’s running against former Gov. Terry McAuliffe, a Democrat, in a race that’s being watched for what it says about Americans’ views of the Biden administration. For LGBTQ+ advocates, it’s also about whether Virginians will pick a candidate who is against marriage equality, a striking stance for a mainstream candidate of either major party.\nThe 19th thanks our sponsors. Become one.\nLate last month, Youngkin told the Associated Press in an interview that he feels “called to love everyone” but, when asked if that expressed support for same-sex marriage, said, “No.” He said it was “legally acceptable” in the state and he would support the law.\nLGBTQ+ rights organization the Human Rights Campaign blasted Youngkin as out of touch with mainstream America.\n“His relentless anti-equality messaging as he closes out his campaign is proof that fundamental fairness and equality are at stake in this election, Joni Madison, the group’s interim president, said in a statement.\nYou have been subscribed!\nSubmitting…\nUh-oh! Something went wrong. Please try again later.\nMcAuliffe rushed to highlight his own history of backing LGBTQ+ rights in Virginia, noting  on Twitter  that he was “proud to be the first Southern governor to officiate a same-sex wedding.”\nIn a statement to The 19th, the Youngkin campaign further clarified the candidate’s stance as a private matter and pointed to other, more inclusive stances he had taken during the campaign.\n“As Glenn said, gay marriage is the law in Virginia and he will support the law as governor,” the campaign said. “Glenn spoke up when pride flags were destroyed because he believes in respecting everyone and protecting everyone.”\nStill, Youngkin’s public opposition to marriage equality troubles those who have considered the issue settled. According to Gallup, support for queer marriage rights in the United States is at an all-time high at 70 percent. A majority of Republicans also now support marriage equality.\nVirginians have also shown strong support for LGBTQ+ residents in recent years. According to the Public Religion Research Institute, 60 percent of Virginians backed marriage equality as of 2017. That same year, the state elected the county’s first out transgender representative, Danica Roem. This year, the legislature voted overwhelmingly to wipe its unenforceable marriage ban from the books.\nThis year however, transgender people have weathered a year of unprecedented political attacks nationwide. Ten anti-trans bills have been signed into law this year in other states. The Equality Act, federal legislation that would grant nondiscrimination protections to LGBTQ+ people nationwide and a key Biden agenda item, has stalled short of votes in the Senate.\nA year ago, while declining to hear a case, Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito on the Supreme Court indicated that marriage equality should be overturned, a move that sent shockwaves through the queer legal community as the court prepared to confirm another conservative justice, Amy Coney Barrett. Equality rights organizations fiercely opposed her confirmation because of her past ties to a  far-right anti-LGBTQ+ organization, the Alliance Defending Freedom.\nYoungkin’s stance against LGBTQ+ unions has sent up red flags for queer political organizers who fear they are losing ground on the swift progress gained since the Supreme Court declared marriage equality the law of the land in 2015.\nLucas Acosta, a senior spokesperson for Democratic National Committee and longtime queer rights activist, said he anticipated backlash after 2020 presidential election and in response to the Biden administration backing LGBTQ+ rights early on.\n“What does surprise me is the fact that even now, some Virginia voters still consider Glenn Youngkin a moderate,” he said. “Solely based on this position alone, he cannot call himself a moderate, and I think that that is on us in the campaign in these closing days, to really drive home for voters across the state.”\nPolling shows a tight race in Virginia, which Biden won by 10 points last year. All 100 seats in the state House of Delegates are also up for grabs, and Democrats are defending a 55-45 majority there.\nShare\nBecome a member\nSign up for our newsletter\nPolitics\nElizabeth Prelogar clerked for now-Supreme Court Justice Elena Kagan, who was the first woman solicitor general.
