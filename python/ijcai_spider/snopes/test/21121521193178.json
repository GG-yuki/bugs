            "report_content": "Colleague's E-mail is Invalid\nYour message has been successfully sent to your colleague.\nSave my selection\nEastman, Peggy\nWASHINGTON, DC—Every year, 18,000 Americans aged 25 to 64 die prematurely because they have no health insurance. That is the conclusion of a new report from a committee of the Institute of Medicine (IOM). The report, “Care Without Coverage: Too Little, Too Late,” the second in an ongoing IOM series of six on the consequences of not having health insurance, was released at a news briefing here.\nCommittee members expressed surprise at the magnitude of harmful effects of going without health insurance. Cancer patients without insurance are especially hard hit.\n“Uninsured cancer patients are generally in poorer health and they are more likely to die prematurely than are persons with health insurance, largely because of delayed diagnosis,” said Mary Sue Coleman, PhD, the IOM committee co-chair, a biochemist and cancer researcher who recently became the President of the University of Michigan after serving as President of the University of Iowa and Iowa Health System since 1995.\n“For example, uninsured women with breast cancer have a 30% to 50% higher risk of dying than women with private health insurance. Uninsured patients with colon cancer have a 50% to 60% higher mortality rate than those with private health insurance.”\nThe other co-chair was Arthur L. Kellermann, MD, Professor and Chairman of the Department of Emergency Medicine and Director of the Center for Injury Control at Emory University School of Medicine.\nIn a subset analysis, the IOM committee calculated that of the 40,000 women who die annually of breast cancer, 360 to 600 are excess deaths that could have been prevented if these women had had regular medical care through health insurance coverage.\nAnd Committee members called this a conservative estimate, saying that the figures for older age groups are much higher. The Committee—which examined more than 130 research studies—cited one study from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimating that 30 percent of breast cancer deaths, about 13,000 annually, could be prevented if women age 50 and older received regular mammograms. This estimate is based on the fact that 80 percent of breast cancers occur in women over age 50.\nThe Committee also found studies concluding that uninsured patients are more likely to die prematurely—largely because of delayed diagnosis—from cervical, colorectal, and prostate cancers and from melanoma.\nThere are an estimated 40 million Americans without health insurance. This IOM report focused primarily on the 30 million working Americans without insurance.\nAs the first IOM report in the series pointed out, the majority of those without health insurance are the “working poor.” Dr. Coleman said that eight out of 10 uninsured people in the United States are working. Many of these are in low-paying jobs that do not provide insurance, or that require a co-payment that is too high for many employees. Even if they work two jobs, as many do, it is hard for these workers to pay for health insurance out-of-pocket.\nAmericans without health insurance have “episodic” and “disjointed” care, said Committee member Reed V. Tuckson, MD, Senior Vice President of Consumer Health and Medical Care Advancement for UnitedHealth Group in Minnesota, former Commissioner of Public Health for the District of Columbia.\nEpisodic care does not foster a regular relationship with a physician, having recommended screening tests such as mammograms or colorectal examinations, or becoming informed about healthy lifestyles, noted Dr. Tuckson. “There is an absence of continuity of care.”\nEmergency departments, where many of the sick uninsured end up, are assuredly not the answer, noted Committee member John Z. Ayanian, MD, Associate Professor of Medicine and Health Care Policy in the Department of Health Care Policy at Harvard Medical School.\n“Emergency departments are not equipped to diagnose people early or treat chronic illness,” he said. They can stabilize a patient and treat a broken bone, but they don't screen for illnesses such as cancer.\n“Not only is it expensive, but it is also not the best care for chronic conditions,” concurred Committee member Edward H. Wagner, MD, Director of the W.A. MacColl Institute for Healthcare Innovation at the Center for Health Studies of Group Health Cooperative in Seattle.\nOne of the report's most disturbing findings related to cancer is that in studies assessing the outcomes for adults with cancer—stage of disease at diagnosis and mortality—people insured under Medicaid often did no better (and sometimes even worse) than uninsured patients.\nThe IOM Committee concluded that this finding may reflect the fact that uninsured people in poor health, once they seek care, may become enrolled in Medicaid—in effect enrolling too late to have much of an impact on a growing and previously undiagnosed cancer.\nDr. Tuckson emphasized that the Committee's findings show that health insurance has to be acquired early, before people become ill, and that they need to obtain a full range of health services on a continuous, coordinated basis. He said this new IOM report should convince members of the general public—-if they still have doubts—that health insurance does, in fact, make a huge difference in health outcomes.\n“This is a major American problem,” Dr. Tuckson said. “It is a tragedy of numbers.\nAnother disturbing finding of this report is that Americans without health insurance are treated differently in the hospital from those who have insurance.\nThe Committee said uninsured hospitalized patients “experience higher rates of death in the hospital, receive fewer services, and are more likely to experience an adverse medical event due to negligence than are insured patients.”\nCommittee members expressed surprise at the magnitude of harmful effects of going without health insurance.\nDr. Ayanian said insurance is a “major factor” when a person enters a hospital. Asked if there is a two-tiered system of care in hospitals, he said that people without insurance “are receiving a lower intensity of care.”\nThe committee found that people who had no insurance or temporarily lost it for a period of one to four years suffered a decline in overall well-being, and that a loss of coverage is most profound for older adults between ages 55 and 65 who are not yet eligible for Medicare.\n“Short periods of going without insurance can make a difference, but longer periods are even more harmful,” said Dr. Ayanian.\nThe IOM Committee's final report in this study series of six will focus on promising strategies for addressing the problem of the uninsured in the United States. The six-report IOM study on uninsured Americans is being funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.\nIf you are an oncologist or an oncology nurse, you should already be receiving a subscription to OT.

That figure is about two and a half times higher than an estimate from the Institute of Medicine (IOM) in 2002.\nThe study, conducted at Harvard Medical School and Cambridge Health Alliance, found that uninsured, working-age Americans have a 40 percent higher risk of death than their privately insured counterparts, up from a 25 percent excess death rate found in 1993.\n“The uninsured have a higher risk of death when compared to the privately insured, even after taking into account socioeconomics, health behaviors, and baseline health,” said lead author Andrew Wilper, M.D., who currently teaches at the University of Washington School of Medicine. “We doctors have many new ways to prevent deaths from hypertension, diabetes, and heart disease — but only if patients can get into our offices and afford their medications.”\nThe study, which analyzed data from national surveys carried out by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), assessed death rates after taking into account education, income, and many other factors, including smoking, drinking, and obesity. It estimated that lack of health insurance causes 44,789 excess deaths annually.\nPrevious estimates from the IOM and others had put that figure near 18,000. The methods used in the current study were similar to those employed by the IOM in 2002, which in turn were based on a pioneering 1993 study of health insurance and mortality.\nFederal insurance has helped many, but system’s holes limit gains, Harvard analysts say\nDeaths associated with lack of health insurance now exceed those caused by many common killers such as kidney disease. An increase in the number of uninsured and an eroding medical safety net for the disadvantaged likely explain the substantial increase in the number of deaths, as the uninsured are more likely to go without needed care. Another factor contributing to the widening gap in the risk of death between those who have insurance and those who do not is the improved quality of care for those who can get it.\nThe researchers analyzed U.S. adults under age 65 who participated in the annual National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES) between 1986 and 1994. Respondents first answered detailed questions about their socioeconomic status and health and were then examined by physicians. The CDC tracked study participants to see who died by 2000.\nThe study found a 40 percent increased risk of death among the uninsured. As expected, death rates were also higher for males (37 percent increase), current or former smokers (102 percent and 42 percent increases), people who said that their health was fair or poor (126 percent increase), and those who examining physicians said were in fair or poor health (222 percent increase).\nSteffie Woolhandler, study co-author, professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, and a primary care physician at Cambridge Health Alliance, noted: “Historically, every other developed nation has achieved universal health care through some form of nonprofit national health insurance. Our failure to do so means that all Americans pay higher health care costs, and 45,000 pay with their lives.”\n“The Institute of Medicine, using older studies, estimated that one American dies every 30 minutes from lack of health insurance,” remarked David Himmelstein, study co-author, associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, and a primary care physician at Cambridge Health Alliance.\n“Even this grim figure is an underestimate — now one dies every 12 minutes.”\nOther authors include Karen E. Lasser, Danny McCormick, David H. Bor, and David U. Himmelstein.

            "report_content": "Discover Thomson Reuters\nBy Susan Heavey\n4 Min Read\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - Nearly 45,000 people die in the United States each year -- one every 12 minutes -- in large part because they lack health insurance and can not get good care, Harvard Medical School researchers found in an analysis released on Thursday.\nSupporters of the health care reform hold signs outside a health care town hall meeting with U.S. congressman Kendrick Meeks in Miami, Florida September 3, 2009. REUTERS/Carlos Barria\n“We’re losing more Americans every day because of inaction ... than drunk driving and homicide combined,” Dr. David Himmelstein, a co-author of the study and an associate professor of medicine at Harvard, said in an interview with Reuters.\nOverall, researchers said American adults age 64 and younger who lack health insurance have a 40 percent higher risk of death than those who have coverage.\nThe findings come amid a fierce debate over Democrats’ efforts to reform the nation’s $2.5 trillion U.S. healthcare industry by expanding coverage and reducing healthcare costs.\nPresident Barack Obama’s has made the overhaul a top domestic policy priority, but his plan has been besieged by critics and slowed by intense political battles in Congress, with the insurance and healthcare industries fighting some parts of the plan.\nThe Harvard study, funded by a federal research grant, was published in the online edition of the American Journal of Public Health. It was released by Physicians for a National Health Program, which favors government-backed or “single-payer” health insurance.\nAn similar study in 1993 found those without insurance had a 25 percent greater risk of death, according to the Harvard group. The Institute of Medicine later used that data in its 2002 estimate showing about 18,000 people a year died because they lacked coverage.\nPart of the increased risk now is due to the growing ranks of the uninsured, Himmelstein said. Roughly 46.3 million people in the United States lacked coverage in 2008, the U.S. Census Bureau reported last week, up from 45.7 million in 2007.\nAnother factor is that there are fewer places for the uninsured to get good care. Public hospitals and clinics are shuttering or scaling back across the country in cities like New Orleans, Detroit and others, he said.\nStudy co-author Dr. Steffie Woolhandler said the findings show that without proper care, uninsured people are more likely to die from complications associated with preventable diseases such as diabetes and heart disease.\nSome critics called the study flawed.\nThe National Center for Policy Analysis, a Washington think tank that backs a free-market approach to health care, said researchers overstated the death risk and did not track how long subjects were uninsured.\nWoolhandler said that while Physicians for a National Health Program supports government-backed coverage, the Harvard study’s six researchers closely followed the methodology used in the 1993 study conducted by researchers in the federal government as well as the University of Rochester in New York.\nThe Harvard researchers analyzed data on about 9,000 patients tracked by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s National Center for Health Statistics through the year 2000. They excluded older Americans because those aged 65 or older are covered by the U.S. Medicare insurance program.\n“For any doctor ... it’s completely a no-brainer that people who can’t get health care are going to die more from the kinds of things that health care is supposed to prevent,” said Woolhandler, a professor of medicine at Harvard and a primary care physician in Cambridge, Massachusetts.\nEditing by Xavier Briand\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.\nAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

            "report_content": "Millions of Americans – as many as 25% of the population – are delaying getting medical help because of skyrocketing costs\nLast modified on Wed 8 Jan 2020 11.13 GMT\nSusan Finley returned to her job at a Walmart retail store in Grand Junction, Colorado, after having to call in sick because she was recovering from pneumonia.\nThe day she returned, the 53-year-old received her ten year associate award – and was simultaneously laid off, according to her family. She had taken off one day beyond what is permitted by Walmart’s attendance policy.\nAfter losing her job in May 2016, Finley also lost her health insurance coverage and struggled to find a new job. Three months later, Finley was found dead in her apartment after avoiding going to see a doctor for flu-like symptoms.\n“My grandparents went by to check on her, and they couldn’t get into her apartment,” her son Cameron Finley told the Guardian. “They got the landlord to open it up, went in and found she had passed away. It came as a complete surprise to everybody. It just came out of nowhere.\n“She was barely scraping by and trying not to get evicted. She gets what appears to her as a basic cold or flu, didn’t go to the doctor and risk spending money she didn’t have, and as a consequence she passed away.”\nAsked about Finley losing her job, Walmart declined to comment, saying personnel files from 2016 had been moved offsite.\nFinley is one of millions of Americans who avoid medical treatment due to the costs every year.\nA December 2019 poll conducted by Gallup found 25% of Americans say they or a family member have delayed medical treatment for a serious illness due to the costs of care, and an additional 8% report delaying medical treatment for less serious illnesses. A study conducted by the American Cancer Society in May 2019 found 56% of adults in America report having at least one medical financial hardship, and researchers warned the problem is likely to worsen unless action is taken.\nDr Robin Yabroff, lead author of the American Cancer Society study, said last month’s Gallup poll finding that 25% of Americans were delaying care was “consistent with numerous other studies documenting that many in the United States have trouble paying medical bills”.\nDespite millions of Americans delaying medical treatment due to the costs, the US still spends the most on healthcare of any developed nation in the world, while covering fewer people and achieving worse overall health outcomes. A 2017 analysis found the United States ranks 24th globally in achieving health goals set by the United Nations. In 2018, $3.65tn was spent on healthcare in the United States, and these costs are projected to grow at an annual rate of 5.5% over the next decade.\nHigh healthcare costs are causing Americans to get sicker from delaying, avoiding, or stopping medical treatment.\nAnamaria Markle, of Port Murray, New Jersey was diagnosed with stage three ovarian cancer in 2017. A clerk for nearly 20 years at the same firm, her family says her employer laid her off after the diagnosis, with one year’s severance and health insurance coverage. When the insurance coverage ended, Markle struggled to pay for coverage through Cobra (a health insurance program for employees who lose their job or have a reduction in work hours), additional expenses, copays (an out-of-pocket, upfront fee for a medical service ), and medical debt not covered by insurance.\nLaura Valderrama, Markle’s daughter, said: “It wasn’t financially sustainable to keep paying Cobra out of pocket. On top of the premiums you still have to pay the bills. We kept getting lots of bills for surgeries, chemotherapy, all these treatments, all these bills kept coming in.”\nMarkle decided to stop receiving medical treatment due to the rising costs and debt, and died in September 2018 at the age of 52.\n“My mom was constantly doing the math of treatment costs while she was on the decline,” Valderrama said. “I really miss my mom. She shouldn’t have had to make the decision to stop her treatment based on financial costs.”\nA 2009 study conducted by researchers at Harvard Medical School found 45,000 Americans die every year as a direct result of not having any health insurance coverage. In 2018, 27.8 million Americans went without any health insurance for the entire year.\nOne of those Americans was the father of Ashley Hudson, who died in 2002 due to an untreated liver disease, an illness that went undiagnosed until a few weeks before his death. It was only discovered when he went to the emergency room because he was unable to afford to see a doctor due to lack of insurance coverage and inability to afford treatment out of pocket.\nNow Hudson’s mother, Sue Olvera, who works at McDonald’s and has no insurance coverage, is facing similar cost barriers while struggling with kidney issues and type 2 diabetes.\n“She’s had pain for a long time, but she doesn’t usually go to the doctor unless it gets excruciating because she can’t afford to go,” said Ashley Hudson.\nThe family is trying to raise money via GoFundMe to help cover the costs of Olvera’s surgery to remove kidney stones earlier this year, which Olvera was expecting to be covered under a charity program, but was denied and now is stuck with over $40,000 in medical debt.\nHealthcare is one of the most contentious issues surrounding the 2020 presidential election as Democratic candidates battle over policies to expand healthcare access and lower costs, from Bernie Sanders’ medicare for all bill which would create a government funded healthcare system providing universal coverage to all Americans, while eliminating surprise medical bills, deductibles, and copays, to healthcare plans that focus on creating a public option under the Affordable Care Act. As Democrats debate solutions to America’s healthcare crisis, the Trump administration is delaying any plans for repealing the Affordable Care Act passed under Obama until after the 2020 election.\nSeveral people the Guardian interviewed are currently avoiding medical treatment for serious illnesses or struggling to treat illnesses worsened by delaying medical care due to costs.\nSubstitute teacher Gretchen Hess Miller, 48, of Carlisle, Pennsylvania, was diagnosed with oral cancer in 2009 while pregnant. She has had surgery to remove the cancer, but is supposed to receive annual scans to monitor the cancer, but hasn’t received one in four to five years because her family can’t afford it.\n“My doctor told me this is an aggressive form of cancer that will come back someday and I need to stay on top of it, but the deductible and the difficulty with dealing with the insurance keeps me from having it done,” said Hess-Miller.\nHer insurance coverage currently requires a $5,000 deductible. She says she has previously had to fight to receive coverage because medical care is constantly denied because insurance classifies oral care as dental rather than medical care.\n“I have kids. I worry about our future. I want to be here for them,” she said. “We’re very thankful to have insurance at all, but families should not have to compromise on if I’m going to pay for my kid’s college or pay for a test to see if I have cancer. People shouldn’t be put in a position to make choices like that.”\nAmy Keeling, 51, a paralegal in New Hampton, Iowa, avoided seeing a doctor for over a year due to her partner’s surgery costs in 2018 for triple bypass surgery.\n“I hadn’t felt good for awhile, but I just thought it was my age. In September 2019, I got the flu, and ended up in the emergency room because I couldn’t breathe,” said Keeling.\nShe was diagnosed with Grave’s Disease, an autoimmune disorder.\n“If I had been going in to the doctor and checking on this a lot sooner, we may have been able to do other alternatives and get a handle on this before it got this serious. I’m at the point where medication won’t control it and my only option is surgery,” she said.\nHer insurance requires a $5,000 deductible. Having met it in 2019, she scrambled to have her surgery scheduled before 2020, when it would reset. All while her partner is looking to file for bankruptcy because he currently has around $40,000 in medical debt.",

Not having health insurance can kill you.\nPresident Donald Trump and Congressional Republicans celebrate House passage of the American Healthcare Act on May 4, 2017.  | REUTERS/Carlos Barria\nAs a practicing physician for going on nearly 50 years now, I often feel like that auto insurance company that says “We know a thing or two because we have seen a thing or two.”\nAfter years of dealing with people who are insured, people who are uninsured and health insurance companies, I know that having real, comprehensive coverage can mean the difference between life and death.\nA few years back, one Republican Congressman – speaking about the impact of GOP legislation that would have drastically cut Medicaid – defended the plan he supported by stating, “Nobody dies because they don’t have access to health care.”\nThat false assurance has been widely debunked by people who actually report on health reform or work in healthcare. But that hasn’t stopped critics of the Affordable Care Act from continuing to promise “Relax. We’ve got this” … all the while promising to dismantle a law that greatly expanded access to affordable health coverage for millions.\nThe current ongoing line of false reassurances has to do with health coverage for people with pre-existing conditions. Many Republicans are on the campaign trail right now claiming that they’ve been protecting folks with pre-existing conditions all along. And these would be the same people who voted for the American Health Care Act in 2017. (The AHCA, passed by the GOP House last year, would have stripped health insurance away from people with pre-existing conditions, had its passage in the Senate not been derailed by late Sen. John McCain.\nThe folks who wrote the ACA bent over backward to ensure that protections for millions would be a central plank of the law:\nUnder current law, health insurance companies can’t refuse to cover you or charge you more just because you have a “pre-existing condition” — that is, a health problem you had before the date that new health coverage starts.\nIn 2017, about half of non-elderly Americans – or about 130 million non-elderly people – had pre-existing conditions in the U.S., according to a brief from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.\nNationally, the most common pre-existing conditions were high blood pressure (44 million people), behavioral health disorders (45 million people), high cholesterol (44 million people), asthma and chronic lung disease (34 million people), and osteoarthritis and other joint disorders (34 million people). – U.S. Department of Health and Human Services\nMore and more people are beginning to understand that. Of American voters, 66 percent of registered voters said that continued protections for people with pre-existing conditions was either the “single most important factor” (14 percent) or a “very important factor” (52 percent) in their vote for a candidate. (Which explains why the GOP is suddenly claiming they love these protections.)\nIf you don’t have a pre-existing condition – or you can’t think of someone right off the top of your head who might have one – let me offer a glance at some of your fellow Americans whose stories as patients have crossed my desk over my years as a Physician Executive.\nThis middle-aged female was sent to the Emergency Department by her cardiologist because of symptoms that  included a five-day history of palpitations (feeling heart beat in chest), dizziness (imbalance) and headache. The EKG showed Atrial Fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response. She also had an elevated blood pressure that was persistent. The admitting diagnosis was new onset atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.\nResult: This patient now has developed the dreaded “pre-existing condition.”\nThis 30-something male patient had a 12-year history of a herniated disc. He presented to the Emergency Department with back pain and sciatica going into his left leg, associated with difficulty walking. A CT scan indicated a disc protrusion in the lower back.\nThis patient had a medical history of a weightlifting injury and known herniated disc. On top of that he presented with a two-week history of gradually increasing low back pain with sciatica. The pain was impacting his ability to walk. An MRI revealed the thecal sac at the nerve root was indented. In layman’s terms, that means the arthritis of the spine was putting pressure on the nerve.\nResult: Patient #2 had a pre-existing condition and could be denied health coverage.\nA middle-aged female patient came to the Emergency Department complaining of a pounding headache located mostly in her forehead, associated with lightheadedness. The patient had a medical history of high blood pressure and heart disease but had not taken her blood pressure medication due to financial reasons for at least two months.\nThe patient also had a history of mild atrial fibrillation and chronic lung disease, but the patient reported that she had not had treatment for those. The patient also reported swelling in her lower extremities for which she took an over-the-counter medication.\nResult: This is not an unusual scenario in today’s healthcare landscape. And this patient could be denied coverage for these pre-existing conditions.\nWhile Republicans did their level best in 2017 to pass a law that would erode protections for folks like the three examples above (and many more), President Donald Trump has been providing his own false assurances about about health coverage. His promise: that Americans can relax, because he’s coming to the rescue with more (and CHEAPER) short-term health insurance alternatives.\nShort-term coverage is not an ideal solution for people with pre-existing conditions. The plans:\nIn October, new federal rules expanded the duration of short-term health plans in many states. But other states have taken a “buyer beware” approach and a handful of states – including New York  and New Jersey – completely ban the sale of short-term health plans.\nSo let’s go back to the original point of this column: that pre-existing conditions are a matter of life and death. They most definitely are – because having a pre-existing condition in the ‘good old days‘ before Obamacare meant that getting comprehensive health coverage on the individual market was difficult or near impossible.\nBut can being uninsured really kill you? From my literature review, it’s clear that you are from 3 to 29 percent more likely to die if you don’t have health insurance than those who do!\nHere’s some of research:\nThe Congressman at the start of this column also famously stated that “Nobody wants anybody to die.” It sounds great – and it’s a notion that most of us can probably agree with.\nBut at this critical juncture in our nation’s healthcare history – when Americans are more concerned than ever about losing the protections they gained from the ACA – we must pay even closer attention.\nWe must closely examine our candidates’ voting records on healthcare. We must not simply nod our heads at last-minute promises about preserving ACA’s protections. We can’t simply decide that cheap coverage is good coverage.\nWe should know better.

Read a new op-ed in Harvard Business Review to find out why that’s not so.\nArea of Focus\nIssue Briefs\nAugust 28, 2019\nWhile the Affordable Care Act expanded health insurance to millions of Americans, an estimated 30.4 million people were uninsured in 2018. Concern about the cost of insurance is a key reason why many are uninsured.\nNearly half of uninsured adults may be eligible for subsidized insurance through the marketplace or their state’s expanded Medicaid program\nWhile the Affordable Care Act expanded health insurance to millions of Americans, an estimated 30.4 million people were uninsured in 2018. Concern about the cost of insurance is a key reason why many are uninsured.\nNearly half of uninsured adults may be eligible for subsidized insurance through the marketplace or their state’s expanded Medicaid program\nThe Affordable Care Act (ACA) brought sweeping change to the U.S. health care system, expanding comprehensive health insurance to millions of Americans and making it possible for anyone with health problems to get coverage by banning insurers from denying coverage or charging more because of preexisting conditions. In 2018 there were 18.2 million fewer uninsured people in the U.S. than when the ACA became law.1 In addition, fewer people are forgoing health care because of cost or reporting high out-of-pocket costs relative to their income.2\nYet, in 2018, an estimated 30.4 million people were uninsured, up from a low of 28.6 million in 2016. Coverage gains have stalled in most states and have even eroded in some.3 In addition, more people have reported problems getting health care because of cost.\nTo examine why so many people remain uninsured, we use data from the 2018 Commonwealth Fund Biennial Health Insurance Survey. Answers to the survey questions can help federal and state policymakers find solutions to help uninsured Americans gain coverage.\nThe ACA’s coverage expansions led to significant declines in uninsured rates among people who had been the most likely to be uninsured: people with low incomes, Latinos, and young adults (Table 1). But in 2018, these groups remained disproportionately uninsured.\nIn 2018, 58 percent of uninsured adults had incomes below 200 percent of the federal poverty level ($24,120 for an individual and $49,200 for a family of four). Across age groups, young adults ages 19 to 34 made up the largest share of the uninsured. More than one-third of the uninsured were Latino even though Latinos make up 18 percent of the working-age adult population (Table 1).\nWe examined the remaining uninsured by income status to determine whether they might be eligible for subsidized coverage. The ACA provides subsidized insurance through two sources: Medicaid for adults who earn less than 138 percent of poverty ($16,643 for an individual or $33,948 for a family of four) in states that expanded Medicaid, and subsidized plans in the ACA marketplaces for those who earn up to 400 percent of poverty ($48,240 for an individual and $98,400 for a family of four).\nThe ACA excludes undocumented immigrants from both the marketplace subsidies and the Medicaid expansion: they may only buy coverage through the individual market outside the marketplaces. We use foreign-born status among Latinos as a rough proxy for uninsured adults who may not be eligible for subsidized coverage because of their immigration status.4 We do not have an estimate of undocumented immigrants of other ethnicities.\nNearly half (47%) of uninsured adults in 2018 had incomes that may make them eligible for either expanded Medicaid or subsidized marketplace plans. The remainder of uninsured adults would not qualify for either: 11 percent earn below 100 percent of poverty and live in a state that did not expand Medicaid;5 8 percent have incomes at or above 400 percent of poverty and are ineligible for the tax credits; and 25 percent were foreign-born Latinos and may be ineligible for Medicaid or subsidized plans because of their immigration status.\nWhile half of adults who were uninsured at the time of the survey might have been eligible for subsidized health care, the majority (67%) of uninsured adults did not try to get health insurance through the marketplace. When asked why, more than one-third (36%) reported it was because they did not think they could afford it, 15 percent said they did not think they needed it, 8 percent said they did not think they would be eligible for insurance, and 7 percent said they were not aware of the marketplace.6\nAffordability is the top reason adults dropped their individual market coverage. One-third (34%) of adults who were either uninsured at the time of the survey or had a gap in coverage in the past 12 months, and who were previously covered by either a plan they bought through the marketplace or directly from an insurance company, reported they lost or dropped their plan because they could not afford it.7 Half of these adults were uninsured, about a quarter had reenrolled into the individual market, 12 percent transitioned into Medicaid, 7 percent enrolled in employer insurance, and 5 percent enrolled into Medicare (data not shown).\nMore than half (57%) of adults who were either uninsured at the time of the survey or had a gap in insurance coverage in the past 12 months and who were previously covered by Medicaid reported they lost their Medicaid coverage because they were no longer eligible. Fourteen percent said they did not reenroll in time and 10 percent had moved.8 After losing Medicaid, about half of these adults remained uninsured, nearly one-third reenrolled in Medicaid, 14 percent enrolled in employer coverage, 3 percent gained individual market coverage, and 3 percent gained Medicare (data not shown).\nThe ACA’s subsidies and reforms to the individual market, such as banning preexisting condition exclusions and premium setting based on health and gender, went into effect in 2014. Before these reforms, in 2010, 60 percent of adults who had individual coverage or had tried to buy it in the past three years said it was very difficult or impossible to find affordable coverage. By 2016, the share of adults reporting difficulty finding affordable coverage in the individual market fell by nearly half, to 34 percent. But in 2018, this progress eroded somewhat: 42 percent of adults reported difficulty finding affordable coverage.\nLarge majorities of insured adults continue to rate their health insurance highly. In 2018, 62 percent of adults with individual market plans and 84 percent with Medicaid rated their health coverage as “good,” “very good,” or “excellent.” Despite affordability concerns and changes made by Congress and the Trump administration, a majority of adults with individual coverage continue to give their health insurance high marks. Significantly more adults with Medicaid gave their coverage high ratings in 2018 compared to 2010.\nAffordability remains a key reason 30 million adults remain uninsured. Our findings show more than a third of uninsured adults who did not try to get coverage through the marketplaces cited affordability concerns. One-third of adults with a coverage gap who were previously insured through the individual market dropped their plans because they could not afford them. The survey also suggests a lack of knowledge among uninsured adults about their coverage options. While the national debate about health care is focused on more sweeping reforms, such as Medicare for All, federal and state policymakers have several options to help millions of people keep or gain coverage within the existing law.\nThe Commonwealth Fund Biennial Health Insurance Survey, 2018, was conducted by SSRS from June 27 to November 11, 2018. The survey consisted of telephone interviews in English and Spanish and was conducted among a random, nationally representative sample of 4,225 adults ages 19 to 64 living in the continental United States. A combination of landline and cellular phone random-digit-dial (RDD) samples was used to reach people. In all, 725 interviews were conducted with respondents on landline telephones and 3,500 interviews were conducted on cellular phones.\nThe sample was designed to generalize to the U.S. adult population and to allow separate analyses of responses of low-income households. Statistical results are weighted to correct for the stratified sample design, the overlapping landline and cellular phone sample frames, and disproportionate nonresponse that might bias results. The data are weighted to the U.S. adult population by age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, household size, geographic region, population density, and household telephone use, using the U.S. Census Bureau’s 2017 Annual Social and Economic Supplement.\nThe resulting weighted sample is representative of the approximately 193.9 million U.S. adults ages 19 to 64. The survey has an overall margin of sampling error of +/– 1.9 percentage points at the 95 percent confidence level. The RDD landline portion of the survey achieved a 8.4 percent response rate and the RDD cellular phone component achieved a 5.2 percent response rate.\nThis survey is the eighth in a series of Commonwealth Fund surveys to measure access to affordable health care over time. The previous surveys were conducted by Princeton Survey Research Associates International using the same stratified sampling strategy that was used in 2018, except the 2001, 2003, and 2005 surveys did not include a cellular phone random-digit-dial sample. In 2001, the survey was conducted from April 27 through July 29, 2001, and included 2,829 adults ages 19 to 64; in 2003, the survey was conducted from September 3, 2003, through January 4, 2004, and included 3,293 adults ages 19 to 64; in 2005, the survey was conducted from August 18, 2005, to January 5, 2006, among 3,352 adults ages 19 to 64; in 2010, the survey was conducted from July 14 to November 30, 2010, among 3,033 adults ages 19 to 64; in 2012, the survey was conducted from April 26 to August 19, 2012, among 3,393 adults ages 19 to 64; in 2014, the survey was conducted from July 22 to December 14, 2014, among 4,251 adults ages 19 to 64; and in 2016, the survey was conducted from July 12 to November 20, 2016, among 4,186 adults ages 19 to 64.\nThe authors thank Robyn Rapoport, Rob Manley, and Erin Czyzewicz of SSRS, and David Blumenthal, Elizabeth Fowler, Chris Hollander, Deborah Lorber, Paul Frame, Jen Wilson, Gabriella Aboulafia, Corinne Lewis, and Roosa Tikkanen of the Commonwealth Fund.\n1.

These adults would only be eligible for their state’s existing Medicaid program, which is usually only available to children and very poor parents, or unsubsidized plans in the marketplaces.\n6. Three percent of uninsured adults ages 19 to 64 who did not visit the marketplace reported it was because they had, or will have, insurance through another source, 2% reported it was because the marketplaces were not open for enrollment when they needed coverage, and 1% reported they went someplace else to look for health insurance.

[+] Medicaid, near the Wilshire Federal Building on January 25, 2017 in Los Angeles, California. / AFP / DAVID MCNEW (Photo credit should read DAVID MCNEW/AFP/Getty Images)\nThis editorial was co-authored by Dr. Linda Gorman, who did almost all of the work. Dr. Gorman is the Director of Heath Care Policy at the Independence Institute.\nThe Republican health plan will kill people,” says Bernie Sanders. “The Republican Party is the party of death,”  says the headline at Political dig. “Repealing Obamacare will kill more than 43,000 people a year,” says an opinion piece in the Washington Post.\nOther writers have shown similar lack of restraint:\nThe Washington Post gave Sanders Four Pinocchios for his claim. We’d like to give all these writers two dozen Pinocchios. Every claim they are making is based on “fake research” that has been thoroughly discredited by independent scholars.\nBy the way,  this is all a rehash of the scare tactics used to justify passing Obamacare in the first place. For example, “Dying for Coverage,” a report by Families USA, made the astounding claim that six people died every day in Florida because they are uninsured. Eight died every day in Texas, nine in California, and four in New York.\nHow was Families USA able to tally up all that carnage with such pinpoint precision? As we explained in 2009, these claims are based on a chain of reports created over two decades. Each preserved the errors in earlier efforts, misinterpreted or mischaracterized the original findings, and based its projections on data that are now more than 40 years old.\nThe chain begins with a paper by Peter Franks et al. in the Journal of the American Medical Association in 1993. In the early 1970s, people were interviewed (only once) to determine their health insurance status. In 1987, they were surveyed to see who was alive and who was dead. The researchers made the implicit assumptions that someone who was uninsured in the early 1970s remained uninsured until 1987 and that someone with private insurance was continuously covered over the same period.\nThe authors made no attempt to determine the causes of death. Auto accident fatalities, gunshot victims, suicides – all these were implicitly assumed to be affected by whether people had health insurance. Armed with these heroic assumptions, the authors concluded that being uninsured increased the probability of death by 25%.\nOne problem is that being uninsured is like being unemployed. It happens to many people for brief periods of time. Most people who are uninsured regain insurance within one year, and people rarely remain uninsured for almost two decades. Another problem is that the authors made no attempt to determine whether access to medical care was in any way related to the causes of their deaths.\nAll in all, these are not results a careful researcher can have much confidence in.\nThe next link in the chain was provided by the Institute of Medicine’s (IOM) 2002 report Care Without Coverage: Too Little, Too Late. It calculated that 18,000 deaths a year in the U.S. are attributable to a lack of health insurance, using the 25 percent result from the Franks study without comment.  The Urban Institute simply updated the IOM calculations in 2008. Families USA applied the Urban Institute updates and the IOM method in its imprecise estimates of deaths from lack of insurance in each state.\nJune O’Neill, former Director of the Congressional Budget Office and her husband Dave, both highly respected economists, approached the question of how health insurance affects health from another direction. They concluded that uninsured people with lower-incomes were only 3% more likely to die over a 14-year period than those with health insurance and being uninsured had no statistically significant effect on anyone else. Later studies support this finding. Card et al. find that “any plausible effect of insurance on health status in the general population will likely be small” and perhaps nonexistent.\nGiven that lifesaving medical care has historically been available to people in the United States even if they cannot pay, the relatively small effect of health insurance on mortality is not surprising. Furthermore, most people in the US have the income, assets, or credit to pay cash for commonly needed medical procedures.\nIt is often claimed that the uninsured are at greater risk because they inappropriately delay seeing a doctor. However, this problem is unlikely to be satisfactorily addressed by the Obamacare solution of enrolling people in Medicaid, which routinely rations care by making people wait. Roughly half of doctors are not taking any new Medicaid patients, and a third are not seeing any Medicaid patients at all.\nThe Oregon Health Experiment found that enrolling the uninsured in Medicaid produced no significant improvement in common clinical health outcomes. It agrees with growing academic literature suggesting that Medicaid patients do worse than the privately insured with respect to  morbidity and mortality.  In fact, forcing large numbers of people to join Medicaid may be worse than no coverage at all.",
