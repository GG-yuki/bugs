            "report_content": "Filed under:\nMarijuana is roughly 114 times less deadly than alcohol, according to recent findings published in the journal Scientific Reports. Of the seven drugs included in the study, alcohol was the deadliest at an individual level, followed by heroin, cocaine, tobacco, ecstasy, methamphetamines, and marijuana. Previous studies consistently ranked marijuana as the safest recreational drug, but it was not known that the discrepancy was this large.\nThe researchers determined the mortality risk by comparing a lethal dose of each substance with the amount typically used. Not only was marijuana the lowest of the drugs tested, but there was such a gap between its lethal and typical doses that they classified it as the only \"low mortality risk\" drug tested. All others were classified as \"medium\" or \"high.\"\nMarijuana comes with a low mortality risk compared to drugs like ecstasy or tobacco\nThese findings contradict the efforts of law enforcement agencies around the country which, despite pockets of decriminalization (and in some cases, legalization), typically focus heavily on marijuana-related arrests. The authors suggest that, based on the results, these agencies would benefit from shifting priorities away from illicit drugs and placing them instead on keeping things like alcohol and tobacco in check. In fact, the researchers believe marijuana to be so low-risk that they suggest a broad, regulated legalization of it in the paper.\nAttempts to compare the danger of particular drugs have been few and far between. It wasn't until the last decade that studies were done to classify the risk of drug abuse in a qualitative and quantitative manner, according to the authors. (They cite attempts at indexing the toxicity or ranking the harm of certain drugs as examples.) Before that,  they claim, the risk assessment of drug abuse was instead based heavily on anecdotal evidence, which often meant that policy decisions were largely based on educated guesses.\nThe researchers clarified that the study does not suggest that moderate alcohol consumption poses a higher risk than regular heroin use. Environmental conditions, like dirty needles or unregulated supplies, contribute to the overall harm caused by using a drug like heroin. Instead, this study was specifically done to measure the deadliness of the substances themselves.\nSubscribe to get the best Verge-approved tech deals of the week.\nPlease confirm your subscription to Verge Deals via the verification email we just sent you.",

The number of Americans who said that tobacco cigarettes are “very dangerous” is more than three times the share who believe that about cannabis, which the federal government continues to classify as an illegal Schedule I substance.\nVia Politico/Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.\nAsked to rate the harmfulness of the four products, only 26 percent said marijuana is very dangerous, whereas 27 percent said it was “somewhat harmful,” 26 percent said it is “not too harmful” and a surprising 18 percent said marijuana is “not harmful at all.”\nVia Politico/Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.\nCompare that to alcohol, which is widely available and legal for adults 21 and older. About twice as many respondents (51 percent) said that alcohol is “very harmful” than did so for marijuana, and just two percent said alcohol isn’t dangerous at all.\nVia Politico/Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.\nTobacco cigarettes topped the list in terms of perceived harmfulness, with 81 percent stating that the product is very dangerous and just one percent contending that there’s no risk.\nVia Politico/Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.\nThe survey, which was produced by Politico and Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and involved phone interviews with over 1,000 adults, also broke down responses by political affiliation. By and large, Republicans, Democrats and independents are in consensus in terms of how they perceive the harmfulness of each product.\nFor marijuana, 25 percent of Democrats said it is very harmful, while 26 percent of Republicans and independents said the same. Democrats and independents were equally likely to say that cannabis isn’t at all harmful (19 percent), compared to 14 percent of Republican respondents.\nThe poll reflects a trend that seems connected to legalization efforts across the country, which generally involve educational campaigns aimed at debunking drug war propaganda about marijuana and highlighting the relative safety of cannabis compared to legal, recreational substances.\nAt the same time that relatively few Americans regard marijuana as seriously harmful, perceptions of the immorality of using cannabis are also notably low, according to a separate survey released last year. Gallup found that 65 percent of respondents considered smoking marijuana “morally acceptable,” whereas fewer said the same about watching porn, the death penalty and cloning animals, for example.\nBut while perceptions of marijuana’s risks are declining, that hasn’t been associated with a corresponding increase in underage usage. That finding comes from a federally funded national survey that was published last week.\nFederal Data Shows Youth Marijuana Use Isn’t Increasing Under Legalization\nPhoto courtesy of Rick Proctor.\nTop House Democrat Peddles Gateway Theory To Justify Marijuana Legalization Opposition\nMinnesota Governor Directs State Agencies To Prepare For Marijuana Legalization\nKyle Jaeger is Marijuana Moment's Sacramento-based senior editor.

J.B. Pritzker (D), will replace Steve Hawkins and join the national advocacy organization as president and CEO.\nThe changeup, which was shared exclusively with Marijuana Moment ahead of the announcement, comes at a vital time in the cannabis legalization movement in which MPP has played a key role in advancing reform in states across the country.\nAdvocates have celebrated Hutchinson’s leadership on the issue, applauding her sponsorship as a state senator of Illinois’s adult-use legalization policy that Pritzker signed into law in 2019, as well as her focus on promoting social equity within the burgeoning marijuana industry.\nHutchinson told Marijuana Moment that in her regulatory capacity as Pritzker’s cannabis advisor, days when she would see thousands of cannabis records cleared under the newly enacted law were the “moments that I will take with me for the rest of my life, wherever it is I go.”\n“It also means that this cannabis legalization work is wrapped around my soul now, so when I got the call from MPP, it was a no-brainer because we know that the march towards federal legalization is going to happen through the states,” she said. “And we have to keep doing that until we get action at the federal level.”\nFrom state lawmaker to administrative advisor, the official has seen the conversation around cannabis policy evolve—particularly as it concerns the importance of addressing the disproportionate consequences of marijuana criminalization.\n“The discussion around cannabis has grown to the point where we have to talk about legalization with the understanding that we have an industry,” Hutchinson said, adding that in the nascent stages of reform discussions “a lot of those initial conversations didn’t center around equity—it was really about freeing the plant.”\n“What Illinois did was different,” she said. “And the biggest lesson I learned—and I think what people respond to—is that if you’re going to normalize and legalize a product for whom the prohibition of that exact same product destroyed generations of communities, you have to center those two things together.”\nWhen you put equity front and center, “you really do come up with better policy proposals,” she said. “If you center the people who are harmed the most by this—the communities that were harmed the most by this—then you can meet people in places where they didn’t even know they were going to agree with you.”\nHawkins, meanwhile, has been wearing two hats for the past year. Beside running MPP, he’s also the president and CEO of the newer organization U.S. Cannabis Council (USCC), an industry-focused marijuana group that’s become heavily involved in federal cannabis reform legislation.\nBefore joining MPP, Hawkins served as the executive director of the National Coalition to Abolish the Death Penalty (NCADP) and executive vice president of the NAACP. Colleagues praised his commitment to the movement and stressed that this staffing decision was mutual and amicable.\n“The MPP board has been incredibly pleased with Steve’s leadership, his ability to coalition build, to bring people together,” Sal Pace, chair of the organization’s board, told Marijuana Moment. “So much of the success at the state level over the last four years has been with Steve at the helm of MPP.” (Disclosure: Pace supports Marijuana Moment’s work via a monthly pledge on Patreon.)\nHutchinson, meanwhile, brings a whole new skill set to the organization’s leadership, with important experience bringing reform to a state legislature and seeing to its coming to fruition in the governor’s office. She also previously served as president of the National Conference of State Legislatures (NCSL).\n“I don’t think I could imagine a biography more perfectly suited for running MPP for the future,” Pace said.\nMPP and USCC will continue to work together in a symbiotic partnership to advance the cause. There’s wide recognition that as more states move to legalize, it adds pressure on Congress to act.\n“I’m proud certainly of all the accomplishments that I’ve had at MPP since I came on as executive director in 2018,” Hawkins told Marijuana Moment. “MPP played a pivotal role with the incubation of the U.S. Cannabis Council, which launched in February, and this seemed to be the perfect time to make the move over to USCC.”\n“Given that MPP has identified such an incredible leader in Toi Hutchinson, this creates a real great dynamic duo, if you will, between myself and Toi,” he said.\nAt USCC, “my vision is really to make sure that we we have some substantial cannabis reform happen in this session of Congress,” Hawkins said. “There are bills pending for legalization, for banking, for expungement. And USCC is going to be continuing to advocate for substantial reform across the board.”\nThis is the latest executive change to happen at MPP in recent years. The group’s founder, Rob Kampia, left the organization in 2017, nearly two decades after founding it. Kampia’s departure was announced shortly after sexual misconduct allegations against him resurfaced amid the #MeToo movement.\nMeanwhile, MPP separately hired a new director of communications last month. Denise Tolliver, a former reporter and congressional staffer. The organization also announced recently that it hired the Louisiana-based founder of CommonSenseNOLA, Kevin Caldwell, as its Southeast legislative manager.\nNew York Lawmaker Files Bill To Legalize Medical Psilocybin Treatments, With Focus On First Responders And Veterans\nPhoto courtesy of Mike Latimer.\nPublished\non\nBy\nState regulators argue that disclosing marijuana licensing information would violate provisions of the constitutional amendment that legalized cannabis in the state in 2018.\nBy Tessa Weinberg, Missouri Independent\nA company denied licenses to grow medical marijuana in Missouri urged the state Supreme Court Tuesday to compel regulators to provide application info that the health department has argued it’s constitutionally obligated to protect.\nAt issue is the Department of Health and Senior Services’s refusal to turn over applications of successful license holders, despite being ordered by lower courts to disclose them.\nDHSS has relied on a provision in the constitutional amendment that legalized medical marijuana in Missouri in 2018. Part of the language voters approved stipulates that DHSS, “shall maintain the confidentiality of reports or other information obtained from an applicant or licensee containing any individualized data, information, or records related to the licensee or its operation…”\nIn its filing with the Missouri Supreme Court, DHSS argued that the administrative hearing commission acted outside of its authority and requested the lower court’s decision be reversed in order to uphold the confidentiality outlined in the state’s constitution.\nJames Layton, an attorney arguing on behalf of DHSS, said Tuesday that it is the right of applicants who submitted information for it to be kept confidential and urged the Missouri Supreme Court to “vindicate” the rights of those who invested their money, personal interest and confidential information.\n“If that right is to be breached,” Layton said Tuesday, “they are entitled to some process before that happens.”\nHowever, Joshua Hill, an attorney representing the California-based company Kings Garden Midwest LLC, who was denied licenses by the state, argued that people denied licenses have a right to appeal the state’s rejection.\n“The state has chosen winners and losers in this case,” Hill said.\nKings Garden filed two applications for licenses to grow medical marijuana, but was denied by the state for each. In its appeal, the company requested that unredacted, complete copies of approved applications be produced, in order to demonstrate its belief that it submitted answers that were similar to successful applicants but received a lower score.\n“We know that to be true in this case, because Kings Garden has two identical cultivation applications that were submitted to the department,” Hill said, later adding: “Those two applications were not scored consistently. We had four points on one question—question number four, for example—and 10 points on the other application.”\nDHSS’s own scoring guide notes that, “if two applicants applying for the same facility type provide identical responses to a question, the score must be the same.”\nDHSS capped the number of licenses it awarded to cultivators, manufacturers and dispensaries and used a private company, Wise Health Solutions, to score applications. The decision to cap the number of licenses issued and concerns over the scoring process have both been the subject of lawsuits and complaints from denied applicants.\nIn May, a Missouri Court of Appeals in the Western District judge ruled that DHSS regulators were wrong to withhold applications. Since applications were ranked competitively, comparing them against one another was necessary to determine whether the state denied a license in an arbitrary or capricious manner, Judge Lisa White Hardwick wrote.\nHill argued Tuesday that is the only way to have a fair appeal of the state’s decision, otherwise the state can say, “‘Well, the other answers were better and we can’t show those to you because they’re confidential.’”\nIn its brief, Kings Garden Midwest argued that confidential information is not immune from discovery in lawsuits and noted that the administrative hearing commission entered a protective order. It also allowed for state regulators to redact applicants’ identifying information when providing the documents Kings Garden requested.\nLayton argued that the language in the Missouri Constitution does not delegate to the administrative hearing commission the authority to decide what is confidential.\n“The (administrative hearing commission) takes the position that it can only do what statutes allow it to do. It has no statute that allows it to close its hearing records, and so none of this stuff gets filed under seal. And so it all becomes public,” Layton said, arguing it’s contrary to the meaning of the constitutional provision.\nWhen asked Tuesday by Chief Justice Paul C. Wilson if DHSS would have the same argument if the context was in a grand jury or civil subpoena, Layton said it would.\n“No one has the power to compel,” Layton said.\nHill argued patient privacy would not be put at risk if applications were disclosed, also noting Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act protections would apply. However, Layton countered that if the lower court’s ruling is upheld, then theoretically patients denied medical marijuana cards could seek the applications of patients who were successful in obtaining them.\nCompeting applications have been requested “in many, perhaps most, of the 578 appeals still pending at the” administrative hearing commission, DHSS wrote in its brief, with action currently postponed until the issue is addressed in the courts.\nSecrecy around basic ownership details of medical marijuana license holders has made it virtually impossible to determine who owns what.\nAn analysis by The Independent and The Columbia Missourian previously found that of the 192 dispensary licenses issued by the state, there were several instances where a single entity was connected to more than five dispensary licenses—a violation of Missouri’s constitution.\nThis past legislative session, an effort by state lawmakers to require disclosure of ownership information ran into roadblocks when state regulators suggested they would recommend a gubernatorial veto if it became law.\nThis story was first published by Missouri Independent.\nMalta Lawmakers Approve Marijuana Legalization Bill, With President’s Signature Expected Soon\nPublished\non\nBy\nIn a new paper published by the National Cancer Institute, a research team of six—including authors from federal agencies such as the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), National Institutes of Health (NIH) and Food and Drug Administration (FDA)—turn a critical eye on cannabis regulatory systems in the United States, writing that administrative burdens stifle much-needed scientific investigation into the drug’s potential health applications and safety concerns.\n“Conflicting federal and state cannabis regulations hinder research in several ways,” says the article, published this month in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute Monographs, “including the inability of researchers to access products that are legal in their state, a lack of standardization and quality control of cannabis and cannabis-derived products within and across states, and no national oversight of this standardization and quality control or the industry.”\n“The most obvious regulatory hurdle in conducting cannabis and cannabinoid research is the schedule I status of cannabis.”\nWith most states having legalized marijuana in some form, an array of new and relatively unstudied products have appeared on the consumer and medical markets, the authors write. “With widespread availability of novel cannabis and cannabinoid products, there is an urgent need to understand their safety and potential effectiveness for medical indications.”\nBut barriers stemming from the federal Controlled Substances Act (CSA), including bureaucratic red tape and a requirement that all approved projects obtain cannabis through NIDA, mean that research—and scientific awareness—don’t keep pace with how real-world products are being used.\nPublished today (#OpenAccess): Monograph on Cannabis, Cannabinoids and Cancer Research. https://t.co/JSaUShiOdn pic.twitter.com/a7w8nLUdfX\n— NCI Supportive Care (@NCISymptomMgmt) December 1, 2021\n“The administrative challenges for cannabinoid research include the single domestic source requirement for cannabis, complex and lengthy registration processes, and schedule I classification of nonintoxicating cannabis components such as CBD,” the paper says. “Because of the time, expenses, and regulatory knowledge required to get a single study started in this field, researchers will frequently opt not to pursue work in this area. Consequently, although more issues need to be addressed by diverse experts, the field will likely continue to be limited to those institutions and researchers who have historically pursued this work.”\nThe article, “Challenges for Clinical Cannabis and Cannabinoid Research in the United States,” is part of a series of papers that resulted from an online symposium last year organized by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) focusing on the state of science surrounding cannabinoids and cancer. The nine-paper collection also includes articles on cannabis policy and public health, cancer risks and nonmedical cannabis use, using cannabinoids to treat adverse effects of cancer or chemotherapy and cannabinoids’ possible role in cancer treatment and prevention.\nThe paper on challenges faced by researchers and clinicians is especially notable because it represents members of the federal cannabis regulatory apparatus critiquing the apparatus itself.\n“In an effort to elucidate both the safety and the potential therapeutic uses of these products for a range of indications for which they are already approved in an overwhelming majority of the United States,” they write, “researchers must work tirelessly through institutional, regulatory, funding, and drug supply hurdles, all of which significantly influence the scientific impact, public health relevancy, and efficiency of investigations.”\nRecreational and medicinal cannabis use has changed dramatically over the past decade; yet research examining the risks and benefits of cannabis use has lagged behind the media promotion and their use by the general public and cancer patients. https://t.co/zzebFVVL6d @theNCI pic.twitter.com/4BcsamqRZf\n— NCI Supportive Care (@NCISymptomMgmt) December 1, 2021\nTo help clear the barriers, the paper says, collaborations can be especially effective, with more experienced researchers advising those less familiar with the field’s unique features. Universities “and agencies like the FDA can also provide guidance and support,” it adds. International partnerships, meanwhile, “have significant potential to enhance research collaboration by leveraging opportunities in other countries and potentially avoiding difficult regulations that hinder development.”\nSome reforms aimed at easing federal restrictions have ultimately added to the confusion, the authors note, such as with the federal legalization of hemp and hemp-derived CBD through the 2018 Farm Bill.\n“Although there has been movement in the field to relax regulations, including the landmark change decontrolling CBD derived from hemp, many changes have, in fact, made the regulatory landscape more confusing and difficult to navigate for the researcher,” they write. “For example, in the case of CBD, according to the DEA interim final rule that outlines DEA’s amendments to the CSA made by the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018, products with CBD specifically derived from the plant that contain less than 0.3% delta-9-THC are now decontrolled, yet synthetic CBD remains on schedule I according to the CSA. Despite the fact that the molecule is the same, its origins define its regulatory standing.”\nJournal of the National Cancer Institute Monographs\nThings are even more convoluted when it comes to delta-9 THC, the main psychoactive component of cannabis, which the paper notes “has 3 distinct schedules based on the source of production and the formulation”: FDA-approved oral capsules of a synthesized version of the cannabinoid are in Schedule III of the CSA, while a similar FDA-approved liquid version is in Schedule II. Non FDA-approved formulations of the same synthesized THC, meanwhile, remain in Schedule I—along with natural THC derived from cannabis itself.\n“These are a few examples of the confusing nature of cannabinoid scheduling that require near mastery to successfully identify whether a proposed trial with a potential study medication requires a schedule I DEA license,” the article says.\nThat’s not to say progress can’t be made when researchers and regulators cooperate, it adds, pointing to the government’s approval and rescheduling of Epidiolex, a prescription concentrate of cannabis-derived CBD. FDA approved the drug to treat certain forms of pediatric epilepsy in mid-2018, and DEA rescheduled it a few months later.\n“The marketing approval of Epidiolex, particularly in light of the DEA’s placement of FDA-approved CBD-containing products in schedule V according to the CSA,” the paper says, “shows that the clinical development of cannabis-derived medicines derives from the concerted evolution of biomedical knowledge and regulatory flexibility.”\nBut for now, the lack of deep and thorough scientific knowledge of cannabis is having a real impact on consumers and patients. Not only are the long-term effects of high-THC or regular CBD use not well known, but doctors are shying away from recommending cannabis to patients even in cases where it might be beneficial.\n“Oncologists frequently discuss the clinical use of cannabis with their patients although most feel they lack an adequate knowledge base to advise effectively,” the paper says. Despite “strong evidence in support of the use of cannabinoids for chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting as well as pain,” it adds, “many oncologists prefer to recommend approved pharmaceuticals with larger bodies of supporting evidence.”\nState cannabis policies differ in areas that may have implications for public health and consumer safety. Studying these policy differences and their impacts on cancer health will be important to inform future policymaking. https://t.co/dO81AlOUY1 pic.twitter.com/rKGg2OoRv3\n— NCI Supportive Care (@NCISymptomMgmt) December 6, 2021\nEfforts to expand research into cannabis and other Schedule I drugs, such as certain psychedelics, are currently underway. Last week, DEA and NIDA both testified at a House Energy and Commerce subcommittee hearing in favor of a White House proposal to streamline the process.\nDEA said in written testimony that “expanding access to Schedule I research is a critical part of DEA’s mission to protect public safety and health.”\n“It is critical that the scientific and medical community study Schedule I substances, as some may turn out to have therapeutic value,” DEA Principal Deputy Administrator Louis Milione said. “DEA supports the administration’s legislative proposal’s expansion of access to Schedule I research. DEA looks forward to continuing to work with the research community and our interagency partners to facilitate Schedule I research.”\nNIDA submitted a separate report to Congress in October emphasizing that the Schedule I status of controlled substances such marijuana is preventing or otherwise discouraging research into their potential risks and benefits.\nIn an interview earlier this month, NIDA Director Dora Volkow said that even she—the top federal official overseeing drug research—is personally reluctant to conduct studies on Schedule I substances like marijuana because of the “cumbersome” rules that scientists face when investigating them.\nCalls to expedite research into Schedule I drugs seems to be an emerging theme in the Biden administration. For example, DEA has repeatedly proposed significant increases in the production of marijuana, psilocybin and other psychedelics for research purposes, with the intent of aiding in the development of new federally approved therapeutic medications.\nNIDA’s Volkow told Marijuana Moment in a recent interview that she was encouraged by DEA’s prior proposed increase in drug production quota. She also said that studies demonstrating the therapeutic benefits of psychedelics could be leading more people to experiment with substances like psilocybin.\nBut while the production developments are promising, advocates are still frustrated that these plants and fungi remain in the strictest drug category in the first place, especially considering the existing research that shows their medical value for certain conditions.\nThere has been at least one recent development in the fight to modernize marijuana research. President Joe Biden signed a massive infrastructure bill last month that includes provisions aimed at allowing researchers to study the actual cannabis that consumers are purchasing from state-legal dispensaries instead of having to use only government-grown cannabis.\nA federal appeals court recently dismissed a petition to require the DEA to reevaluate cannabis’s scheduling under the Controlled Substances Act. However, one judge did say in a concurring opinion that the agency may soon be forced to consider a policy change anyway based on a misinterpretation of the therapeutic value of marijuana.\nMeanwhile, DEA has given hemp businesses that sell delta-8 THC products a boost, with representatives making comments recently signaling that, at the federal level at least, it’s not a controlled substance at this time.\nSeparately, the Washington State attorney general’s office and lawyers representing cancer patients recently urged a federal appeals panel to push for a DEA policy change to allow people in end-of-life care to access psilocybin under state and federal right-to-try laws.\nNew York Lawmaker Files Bill To Legalize Medical Psilocybin Treatments, With Focus On First Responders And Veterans\nEmail address:\nAll the cannabis news you need, all in one place.\nCopyright © 2017-2021 Marijuana Moment LLC ® and Tom Angell\nEmail address:",

            "report_content": "You may have had the debate yourself—what’s worse? Alcohol or marijuana? With new studies coming out, more laws legalizing the recreational, and medicinal use of marijuana, the conversation seems to come up again and again.\nEven though we may all have different opinions, marijuana remains a Schedule I drug, while alcohol is legal to consume for people who are 21 years of age or older.\nIn a now famous New Yorker interview, President Obama said, “I don’t think it [marijuana] is more dangerous than alcohol.”\nSo, is alcohol or marijuana more dangerous? Here we present both sides of the debate so you can decide for yourself.\nIn most cases, drinking alcohol is not life-threatening. However, when people consume too much alcohol, it can be fatal. The CDC reports that nearly 88,000 alcohol-related deaths occur each year. And binge drinking accounted for about half of these deaths.\nIn comparison, the number of deaths caused by marijuana is almost zero. A study found that a fatal dose of TCH, the potent chemical in marijuana, would be between 15 and 70 grams. To give you an idea of how much marijuana that is, consider that a typical joint contains about half a gram of marijuana. That means that you would have to smoke between 238 and 1,113 joints in a day to overdose on marijuana. That’s a lot of joints.\nWhen it comes to what substance will put someone at risk for getting hurt or hurting others, alcohol is considered to cause the most harm.\nA study on marijuana use and intimate partner violence found that couples who used marijuana had lower rates of intimate partner violence in the first 9 years of marriage. In fact, men who used marijuana were the least likely to commit an act of intimate partner violence against a spouse.\nDriving stoned is considerably safer than driving drunk, but it is still dangerous.\nBesides alcohol, marijuana is the most commonly detected drug in drivers involved in car accidents. One study found that marijuana increased the odds of being in car accident by 83%.\nYou may think that 83% is high, but when alcohol was involved, the odds of being in a car accident increased more than 2,200%!\nWhen both alcohol and drugs were in the system, the risk of having a fatal car accident is especially high.\nWhat’s the takeaway here? It’s never a good idea to drive under the influence of drugs or alcohol, but especially both.\nAfter a long night of heavy drinking, you may not remember what happened the night before. This is often referred to as a “blackout.”\nWhen you drink heavily it can impair your ability to create new memories. Over 50% of frequent binge drinkers reported at least one time in the past year when they blacked out and forgot where they were or what they did when they were drinking.\nIn an email survey, college students reported that after a blackout they did things that they could not remember, like driving drunk, having unprotected sex, or engaged in risky behavior.\nAlong the lines of memory, recent studies have shown that adolescents who smoke marijuana may be at greater risk for problems with memory and learning later in life. The studies remain inconclusive about how much marijuana use causes impairments of learning and memory. But studies have demonstrated that these types of changes in the brain may increase the risk of psychological difficulties later in life.\nControversy remains over what percentage of psychosis risk can be linked to marijuana use and how much depends on a person’s genetics.\nUsing alcohol even during the first few weeks of pregnancy can cause long-lasting effects on a child. According to the CDC, 3.3 million women are at risk of exposing their baby to alcohol.\nIf you drink during pregnancy, you are at risk for having a child born with physical, behavioral, and intellectual disabilities—these are called fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs). According to the CDC there is no known amount of alcohol that is safe to consume during pregnancy.\nBut marijuana may not be safe either. Studies show there may be a link between marijuana use during pregnancy and low birth weight. Despite marijuana being the most commonly used illegal drug during pregnancy, it’s hard to tell what the effect of marijuana use is, since there are not many studies out there.\nSo you’re probably wondering, with all of this information the question remains, alcohol or marijuana? What side are you on? Perhaps we can shift our thinking and instead of taking sides, we can all agree that both alcohol and marijuana have their risks. The overall take-home message may be if you are about to drive a car, if you are an adolescent, or you are pregnant you probably should not use either one.\nLauren worked as a Web Content Writer at Recovery Brands.

            "report_content": "Heavy cannabis use linked to downward social class mobility, antisocial behaviors in the workplace and relationship conflict.\nIt’s often said that marijuana is “safer” than alcohol, in terms of fewer deaths from overdoses, traffic accidents and health-care costs, but a study by UC Davis and Duke researchers has found that from a financial and social point-of-view, there’s nothing safe about heavy cannabis use.\n“People who smoked cannabis four or more days of the week over many years ended up in a lower social class than their parents, with lower-paying, less skilled and less prestigious jobs than those who were not regular cannabis smokers,” said Magdalena Cerdá, an epidemiologist at the UC Davis Violence Prevention Research Program. “These regular and persistent users also experienced more financial, work-related and relationship difficulties, which worsened as the number of years of regular cannabis use progressed.”\nCerdá is lead author of a research study with colleagues at Duke University that has been following a group of children born in 1972-1973 in Dunedin, New Zealand, from birth to age 38 to assess changes in health over a lifetime. The research team recently published a study on the impact of heavy and persistent cannabis use among these research participants.\nThe team found that regular cannabis users experienced downward social mobility and more financial problems such as troubles with debt and cash flow than those who did not report such persistent use. They also had more antisocial behaviors at work, such as stealing money or lying to get a job, and experienced more relationship problems, such as intimate partner violence and controlling abuse.\n“Regardless of how we looked at the relationship between persistent, regular cannabis use and economic and social problems, we got the same results.”— Madgalena Cerdá\n“Regardless of how we looked at the relationship between persistent, regular cannabis use and economic and social problems, we got the same results,” Cerdá said.\nThe authors accounted for an array of potential differences between regular cannabis users and other study participants, including socioeconomic problems in childhood, lower IQ, antisocial behavior and depression in adolescence, higher levels of impulsivity, lower motivation to achieve, criminal conviction of cannabis users, and abuse of alcohol and hard drugs.\n“These findings did not arise because cannabis users were prosecuted and had a criminal record,” said Avshalom Caspi, a psychologist with dual appointments at Duke University and the Institute of Psychiatry at King’s College London. “Even among cannabis users who were never convicted for a cannabis offense, we found that persistent and regular cannabis use was linked to economic and social problems.”\nThe study only addressed the economic and social consequences of cannabis use. In this domain, they found that cannabis did not appear to be safe and may be just as harmful as alcohol.\n“Cannabis may be safer than alcohol for your health, but not for your finances,” said Terrie Moffitt, a study co-author and psychologist with dual appointments at Duke University and the Institute of Psychiatry at King’s College London.\nCitation: “Persistent cannabis dependence and alcohol dependence represent risks for midlife economic and social problems: A longitudinal cohort study,” Magdalena Cerdá, et al. Clinical Psychological Science, online, March 23.\nWith regard to downward social class mobility, antisocial behaviors in the workplace and relationship conflict, the researchers found that cannabis dependence was worse than alcohol dependence in the case of financial difficulties, such as troubles with debt and cash flow, and food insecurity.\n“This is an important finding, given the common conception that cannabis is safer than alcohol,” Cerdá said. “Alcohol is still a bigger problem than cannabis because alcohol use is more prevalent than cannabis use. But, as the legalization of cannabis increases around the world, the economic and social burden posed by regular cannabis use could increase as well.”\nCerdá says that the research is not intended to support arguments for or against cannabis legalization, but it does show that cannabis was not safe for the long-term users tracked in the study. It also raises awareness of the consequences that persistent cannabis use poses to families, communities and national social welfare systems.\nRead other feature stories\nFollow us on social media »\nStay connected with what’s happening at UC Davis Health.\nBack to top",
