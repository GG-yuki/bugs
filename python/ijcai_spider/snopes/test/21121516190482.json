These trillions of dollars make up about 21 percent of the U.S. economy (as measured by Gross Domestic Product, or GDP). It's also about $12,000 for every woman, man and child in the United States.\nSo where does all that money go?\nThe U.S. Treasury divides all federal spending into three groups: mandatory spending, discretionary spending and interest on debt. Mandatory and discretionary spending account for more than ninety percent of all federal spending, and pay for all of the government services and programs on which we rely. Interest on debt, which is a much smaller amount than the other two categories, is the interest the government pays on its accumulated debt, minus interest income received by the government for assets it owns. The pie chart shows federal spending in 2015 broken into these three categories.\nDownload Image\nFacebook\nTwitter\nSource: OMB, National Priorities Project\nDiscretionary spending refers to the portion of the budget that is decided by Congress through the annual appropriations process each year. These spending levels are set each year by Congress.\nThis pie chart shows how Congress allocated $1.11 trillion in discretionary spending in fiscal year 2015.\nDownload Image\nFacebook\nTwitter\nSource: OMB, National Priorities Project\nBy far, the biggest category of discretionary spending is spending on the Pentagon and related military programs. Examples of other well-known programs paid for by discretionary spending include the early childhood education program Head Start (included in Housing & Community), Title I grants to disadvantaged schools and Pell grants for low-income college students (Education), food assistance for Women, Infants and Children (WIC), training and placement for unemployed people provided by Workforce Investment Boards (in Social Security, Unemployment and Labor), and scientific research through the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and National Science Foundation (NSF), among many others.\nMandatory spending is spending that Congress legislates outside of the annual appropriations process, usually less than once a year. It is dominated by the well-known earned-benefit programs Social Security and Medicare. It also includes widely used safety net programs like the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP, formerly food stamps), and a significant amount of federal spending on transportation, among other things.\nMany mandatory programs' spending levels are determined by eligibility rules. For example, Congress decides to create a program like Social Security. It then sets criteria for determining who is eligible to receive benefits from the program, and benefit levels for people who are eligible. The amount of money spent on Social Security each year is then determined by how many people are eligible and apply for benefits.\nCongress therefore does not decide each year to increase or decrease the budget for Social Security or other earned benefit programs. Instead, it periodically reviews the eligibility rules and may change them in order to exclude or include more people, or offer more or less generous benefits to those who are eligible, and therefore change the amount spent on the program.\nMandatory spending makes up nearly two-thirds of the total federal budget. Social Security alone comprises more than a third of mandatory spending and around 23 percent of the total federal budget. Medicare makes up an additional 23 percent of mandatory spending and 15 percent of the total federal budget.\nThis chart shows where the projected $2.45 trillion in mandatory spending will go in fiscal year 2015.\nDownload Image\nFacebook\nTwitter\nSource: OMB, National Priorities Project\nFinally, putting together discretionary spending, mandatory spending, and interest on the debt, you can see how the total federal budget is divided into different categories of spending. This pie chart shows the breakdown $3.8 trillion in combined discretionary, mandatory, and interest spending budgeted by Congress in fiscal year 2015.\nDownload Image\nFacebook\nTwitter\nSource: OMB, National Priorities Project\nHere's how federal spending and revenue in 2015 add up:\nFacebook\nTwitter\nWhen the federal government spends money on mandatory and discretionary programs, the U.S. Treasury writes a check to pay the program costs. But there is another type of federal spending that operates a little differently. Lawmakers have written hundreds of tax breaks into the federal tax code - for instance, special low tax rates on capital gains, and a deduction for home mortgage interest - in order to promote certain activities they deem beneficial to society.\nIn fact, tax breaks function as a type of government spending, and they are officially called \"tax expenditures\" within the federal government. When the government issues a tax break, it chooses to give up tax revenue for a specific purpose - so both spending and tax breaks mean less money in the U.S. Treasury, and both reflect spending priorities laid out by Congress in various pieces of legislation. Tax breaks are expected to cost the federal government $1.22 trillion in 2015 - more than all discretionary spending in the same year.\nDownload Image\nFacebook\nTwitter\nSource: OMB, National Priorities Project\nUnlike discretionary spending, which must be approved by lawmakers each year during the appropriations process, tax breaks do not require annual approval. Once written into the tax code, they remain on the books until lawmakers modify them. That means that even when tax breaks fall short of, or outlive their original purpose intended by Congress, they frequently stay on the books.\n« Where Does the Money Come From\nBorrowing and the Federal Debt »\nDonate\nA project of the Institute for Policy Studies",

            "report_content": "An official website of the United States government\nHere’s how you know\nNote: Get ERS analysis of the 2018 Farm Act.\nThe Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 (2018 Farm Act) consists of 12 titles governing a wide range of policy areas related to food and agriculture. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projected the total cost of the 2018 Farm Act would be $428 billion over the 5-year period 2019-2023. Nutrition programs account for about three-fourths of this total, with projected outlays for crop insurance, conservation, and commodities representing nearly all the rest.\nMandatory funding. Programs authorized with mandatory funding are provided funds as needed (or to a statutory level) through the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) and are not subject to annual appropriations decisions by Congress. Spending is not constrained by annual limits. Government costs under these programs may vary from year to year, depending on program-participation levels and economic conditions. Congress can alter mandatory-funding levels at any time through new legislation, but there is no automatic reconsideration during the span of the Farm Act. Examples of Farm Act programs provided with mandatory funding include the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) as well as most commodity and conservation programs.\nDiscretionary funding. Programs authorized with discretionary funding may be funded up to the level provided by legislation, but Congress may change the funding level each year for these programs. Once program expenditures reach the level appropriated for that year, no additional funds can be spent unless Congress provides new appropriations. Many research and rural-development programs are funded in this way.\nCBO projections include only programs authorized with mandatory funding in the Farm Act.\nNutrition. Mandatory nutrition-program spending was projected to account for more than 75 percent of 2018 Farm Act outlays. Details on food and nutrition-assistance-program spending can be found at ERS Ag and Food Statistics: Charting the Essentials, Food Security and Nutrition Assistance.\nCrop insurance. Under the 2018 Farm Act, crop-insurance-program expenditures were projected to comprise almost 9 percent of total outlays over 2019-23. These expenditures include support to crop-insurance companies for delivery and underwriting, as well as subsidies for farmer premiums.\nAs prices for several major commodities fell from their peaks in 2012-13, premiums and subsidy expenditures correspondingly dropped, since premium calculations depend in part on expected prices and subsidies are a set percentage of the premium. With prices rising again in 2021, premiums and subsidies have followed, also fueled by rising use of index insurance policies. Following the introduction of revenue-based insurance policies in the 1990s, their use increased to cover the largest share of enrolled acres. However, acres insured under rainfall index policies for pasture, rangeland, and forage crops—widely available since 2016. Additionally, acres insured under wind index hurricane risk policy endorsements, introduced in 2020, have increased rapidly and now rival revenue-based coverage.\nConservation. Mandatory conservation-program expenditures were projected to account for about 7 percent of outlays under the 2018 Farm Act over 2019-23. Details on conservation-program spending are provided on the ERS website topic page Conservation Programs: Background.\nCommodity Programs. Commodity-program payments are projected to make up just over 7 percent of outlays under the 2018 Farm Act over 2019-23. As in the previous Farm Act, commodity payments can respond to changes in yields and market prices, a feature which adds uncertainty to total outlays. For this reason, producers may receive higher or lower payments than the levels initially projected by CBO.\nUSDA, Economic Research Service farm income data includes calendar-year data, historical and forecast, on direct Government payments.\nUSDA, Risk Management Agency (RMA) program data are available by crop year and reinsurance year, historical and most-current years. Crop insurance-program cost and performance data are available on a crop-year basis.\nLast updated: Tuesday, October 19, 2021\nFor more information, contact:\nErik  Dohlman",

            "report_content": "Both federal and state legislators regularly try to place limits on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP, or “food stamps”). In recent years, these self-described “conservatives” have tried to cut food stamp funding and program access, every way possible and to shocking degrees. They propose rules to humiliate and demonize recipients of food stamps and other welfare programs, which they claim create a “culture of dependency.”\nThe fight continues to protect food assistance benefits as the first line of defense against both hunger and poverty. Therefore people must understand how the food stamps program works, who it helps, and how much it actually costs.\nSo let’s get to it.\nYou’ve likely heard stories (and outrage) about people using food stamps to purchase “steak and lobster” as well as cigarettes and alcohol, showing up at the grocery store in a nice car, nice clothes, a nice purse or an iPhone. But the federal government sets the food stamps benefit amount at, on average, roughly $4 a day per person.\nYes, someone could save up their monthly allotment to buy some high-priced food items for a special occasion. But they are likely eating rice and beans, peanut butter sandwiches – and going hungry – the rest of the month. (And you definitely can’t use food stamps to buy prepared foods or anything that’s not food.)\nMany people fall into poverty after a job loss, losing a partner or spouse, or a major illness or accident. Or they were born into poverty and remained stuck there largely due to circumstances beyond their control. Either way, they will maintain appearances and hold onto any nice things they have for as long as they can. After all, they’re clearly being judged by those around them.\nAnd you have to prove it. The U.S. Congress sets the rules and the funding for the SNAP/food stamps program, and then states administer it. To be eligible for food stamps your social security number is run through a number of government databases and you have to provide documents of your income and all your expenses.\nFederal rules state that you can only be eligible for food stamps if your gross income (before taxes or deductions) is below 130% of federal poverty level guidelines, which determines what a livable income is based on household size. Under the federal policy of “categorical eligibility,” states can opt into higher income guidelines under certain circumstances, and more than 40 states do. In Pennsylvania, gross income can be up to 160% of the official poverty level, and 200% if a household member is elderly or disabled. (You can find the exact income guidelines here). However, Pres. Trump is trying to end states’ ability to let the near-poor access SNAP by terminating categorical eligibility, which will kick millions of Americans off food stamps.\nSome people aren’t eligible for food stamps regardless of income, such as all undocumented immigrants, certain legal immigrants, and individuals who are on strike. Pres. Trump’s plan to end categorical eligibility will also force all states to  require burdensome asset tests. States can also create their own eligibility measures, like barring from SNAP those who fail drug tests or people with prior criminal offenses.\nIn 1996, President Clinton and Congress put in place work requirements for unemployed food stamps recipients. Able-bodied adults age 18-49 and without dependents must work at least 20 hours a week to receive SNAP benefits. Alternatively, they must be engaged in job training, education, or community service for a certain number of hours each week. Otherwise they can only receive food stamps for 3 months in a 3-year period. High unemployment caused this rule to be suspended during the recent economic recession but is now back in place. (In Pennsylvania, the Wolf administration reinstated work requirements in most of the state on March 1, 2016. However, starting January 1, 2019, they waived the work requirement for much of PA, including Allegheny County. These waivers are renewed every year, so the areas which are waived may change again in 2020.)\nNow that you know the basic rules (more info here on eligibility, what you can buy with food stamps, and how to apply), let’s address common complaints and questions about the food stamps program:\nThe need for food assistance is greater than food stamps can fill.  Furthermore, the benefit amount is too low to allow a family to purchase an adequate, healthy diet.\nA 2015 Obama administration report found that SNAP’s numerous benefits are clear.\nA growing body of high-quality research shows that SNAP is highly effective at reducing food insecurity, and in turn has important short-run and long-run benefits for low-income families. SNAP’s benefits are especially evident and wide-ranging for those who receive food assistance as children; they extend beyond the immediate goal of alleviating hunger and include improvements in short-run health and academic performance as well as in long-run health, educational attainment, and economic self-sufficiency.”\nAdditionally, spending on food assistance helps the economy more than any other stimulus spending. Federal government research shows $1 billion in SNAP benefits  results in $1.5 billion in economic activity and creates 13,560 jobs.\nIt makes sense. SNAP dollars go to people living paycheck to paycheck. They immediately spend the benefits on food. For some, this leaves them more income to purchase other necessities, which boosts our economy and helps create jobs.\nNearly 39.7 million Americans received food stamps in 2018. The federal government created food stamps as an entitlement program so that anyone who qualifies can immediately receive nutrition assistance. Funding for the program automatically expands based on need; this keeps people from starving during hard times.\nNot surprisingly, participation in SNAP/food stamps increased by 70% between 2007 and 2011 due to the economic recession. Conservative legislators complained at this time that food stamp spending had reached record highs. But this is exactly how the program is supposed to operate. When the economy recovers, as it did, SNAP spending falls.\nBut huge wealth gaps in this country remain; the U.S. economy doesn’t work for everyone. Income inequality is at levels not seen in nearly 100 years, and is still increasing. Some 40% of Americans couldn’t cover a $400 emergency expense, and one in four have no retirement savings. Wherever and whenever wages don’t keep up with the rising costs of living – which is of course nearly always the case for workers with low wages, unsteady income, and few benefits – food stamp participation will rise.\nThe federal government designed SNAP benefits as short-term food assistance for the unemployed, or longer-term help for those who can’t work or aren’t earning enough. Decades ago, more food stamp recipients also received government cash assistance and few worked. But after the 1996 Welfare Reform Act remade welfare as Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) and turned the program over to the states, only a fraction of families in deep poverty who qualify for cash assistance receive it.\nThat year, another federal mandate was put in place to require food stamp recipients to work if they can. However, food stamps (unlike TANF) were already effective at supporting work:\nFor every additional dollar a SNAP recipient earns, her benefits decline by only 24 to 36 cents — much less than in most other programs. Families that receive SNAP thus have a strong incentive to work longer hours or to search for better-paying employment. States further support work through the SNAP Employment and Training program, which funds training and work activities for unemployed adults who receive SNAP.”\nYet as of 2016, 40 states had work requirements for food stamps in place, including the 22 states that suspended them during the high unemployment caused by the Great Recession.\nAround 2/3 of food stamp recipients are not expected to work because they are senior citizens on a reduced income, people with disabilities, or children.\nThe remaining 1/3 of SNAP households have at least one working-age, non-disabled adult. Of these, more than half work while receiving SNAP — and more than 80% work in the year before or after receiving SNAP. The rates are even higher for families with children.\nUnfortunately, a growing number of SNAP households are employed. They’re working but still can’t get by. These are households in which one of the two wage-earners lost their job or became disabled. Or they are among the increasing numbers of Americans who are in low-wage jobs or are not getting enough hours. The income of the working poor fails to cover rising rents, heating, health care, and other necessary expenses, including food.\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), which oversees SNAP, takes food stamp fraud seriously. “SNAP’s Quality Control (QC) system earns a solid “A” grade. Over 99 percent of those receiving SNAP benefits are eligible,” it reports.  Fraud had been steadily declining prior to this, with SNAP trafficking – people who sell food stamps for cash – at about 4 cents of every food stamp dollar in 1998. The current 1% fraud rate means SNAP benefits abuse amounted to roughly half a million dollars in 2019. That’s a drop in the bucket compared with the $125 billion the U.S. Department of Defense is wasting at last count, or the $334 billion it lost to contractor fraud between 2013-2017.\nOne could say, however, that it’s companies like WalMart and McDonald’s who are abusing welfare, turning food stamps and other assistance programs into a government subsidy for low wages. Companies make high profits by paying poverty-wages. But then it’s on government and taxpayers – including those employees – to make up the difference. (To the tune of $2.6 billion/year for WalMart and $1.2 billion/year for McDonalds.)\nThere is broad public support for a strong safety net. Yet too many elected officials increasingly prioritize granting tax breaks for corporations and the wealthy. They then offset the huge loss in revenue by restricting programs that ensure basic standards of living.\nLegislators shouldn’t balance government budgets on the backs of the tens of millions of working poor and vulnerable households. These folks are already struggling to get by. Nor should elected officials put up costly bureaucratic barriers to human services. These critical programs should not be needlessly hard or humiliating to access.\nWe need government investments and policies that allow all people to achieve their potential. And we must protect basic assistance programs like food stamps for those in times of need.\nThat is the solution to hunger.\nAs the world’s richest nation, we can certainly afford to end hunger. And we must, if we want our country to also be moral and truly strong.\nPushing government at all levels towards this goal is Just Harvest’s mission. Please join us.\nΔ\nThe overhwelming majority of food stamp recipients are seniors, people with disabilities, and working families.\nBeaver County resident Brandie Waxler, a mother of two who just graduated from CCAC and is seeking employment as a dietetic technician, says her monthly SNAP allotment is “very helpful in providing food for my children as well as for myself. It really takes a burden off my shoulders to know that I am able to provide for my family in that way. I don’t know how I would pay for the food we need otherwise.\"\nPresident Johnson created the food stamp program (now called the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program or \"SNAP\") in 1964 along with Medicaid, Head Start, Job Corps and a number of other programs to help address poverty in the U.S., which at that time was at 19% (compared with roughly 15.5% today).\nCongress votes to determine the funding for the food stamp program (and other food assistance programs) every five years in the U.S. Farm Bill.\nBecause food stamps are an entitlement – anyone who meets the guidelines can get food stamps – if Congress wants to cut funding for food stamps then they have to make more severe guidelines about who can get them.\nCongress most recently attempted this in 2014 by forcing states to pay a greater portion of \"heat-and-eat\", the measure that helps people who can't demonstrate their heating costs (typically seniors and those in public housing) still be able to qualify for food stamps. Fortunately,  Pennsylvania is among the states that are happily picking up that tab, in part because heat-and-eat helps their LIHEAP and food stamps administration efforts operate more efficiently.\nCongress did succeed, however, in cutting funding for the food stamps program (and people's benefit amounts) nationwide in November 2013 by ending the extra money that was given to the program during the recent recession.\nThe Trump administration has taken clear aim at SNAP, proposing drastic changes to how it works, cuts to its funding, and harsh eligibility restrictions that would affect millions of Americans and increase hunger.\nCurrent federal government policy says people can only receive food stamps if their total earnings (gross income) are at or below 130% of the federal poverty line, and their net income is at or below 100% of poverty after a range of deductions for things like household size, costs of dependent care and housing, and certain medical costs. Seniors and those with disabilities only have to meet the net income requirement.\nGross and net income limits are higher for people living in Hawaii and Alaska, where the cost of living is higher.\n\"Categorical eligibility\" is used in Pennsylvania and 39 other states to help people who receive Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF or \"cash assistance\") and other assistance programs to automatically qualify for food stamps.\nFood stamp recipients are required to update their state caseworker with any changes to their eligibility status – such as a change in work hours, household size, or an income change greater than $100 – within a month. In Pennsylvania, this information is verified at a \"recertifcation process\" twice a year.\nIf the state determines someone lied in order to receive more food stamps than they were eligible for, they are ordered to repay it and can be accused of fraud, which can come with a hefty fine and jail time.\nThere are no upcoming events at this time.\n© 2021 Just Harvest.

            "report_content": "The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), also known as the Agriculture Department, is the federal executive department responsible for developing and executing federal laws related to farming, forestry, rural economic development, and food. It aims to meet the needs of commercial farming and livestock food production, promotes agricultural trade and production, works to assure food safety, protects natural resources, fosters rural communities and works to end hunger in the United States and internationally.\nApproximately 80% of the USDA's $141 billion budget goes to the Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) program. The largest component of the FNS budget is the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (formerly known as the Food Stamp program), which is the cornerstone of USDA's nutrition assistance.[2] The United States Forest Service is the largest agency within the department, which administers national forests and national grasslands that together comprise about 25% of federal lands.\nThe Secretary of Agriculture is Tom Vilsack since February 24, 2021.[3]\nThe USDA is divided into different agencies:\n-Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS)\n-Agricultural Research Service (ARS)\n-Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS)\n-Economic Research Service (ERS)\n-Farm Service Agency (FSA)\n-Food and Nutrition Service (FNS)\n-Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS)\n-Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS)\n-Forest Service (FS)\n-FPAC Business Center\n-National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS)\n-National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA)\n-Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS)\n-Risk Management Agency (RMA)\n-Rural Development (RD)\n-Rural Utilities Service (RUS)\n-Rural Housing Service (RHS)\n-Rural Business-Cooperative Service (RBS)[4]\nMany of the programs concerned with the distribution of food and nutrition to people of the United States and providing nourishment as well as nutrition education to those in need are run by the Food and Nutrition Service. Activities in this program include the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, which provides healthy food to over 40 million low-income and homeless people each month.[5] USDA is a member of the United States Interagency Council on Homelessness,[6] where it is committed to working with other agencies to ensure these mainstream benefits have been accessed by those experiencing homelessness.\nThe USDA also is concerned with assisting farmers and food producers with the sale of crops and food on both the domestic and world markets. It plays a role in overseas aid programs by providing surplus foods to developing countries. This aid can go through USAID, foreign governments, international bodies such as World Food Program, or approved nonprofits. The Agricultural Act of 1949, section 416 (b) and Agricultural Trade Development and Assistance Act of 1954, also known as Food for Peace, provides the legal basis of such actions. The USDA is a partner of the World Cocoa Foundation.\nThe standard history is Gladys L. Baker, ed., Century of Service: The first 100 years of the United States Department of Agriculture (U.S. Department of Agriculture, 1963).[7]\nEarly in its history, the American economy was largely agrarian. Officials in the federal government had long sought new and improved varieties of seeds, plants and animals for import into the United States. In 1829, by request of James Smithson out of a desire to further promulgate and diffuse scientific knowledge amongst the American people, the Smithsonian Institution was established, though it did not incorporate agriculture.[8] In 1837, Henry Leavitt Ellsworth became Commissioner of Patents in the Department of State. He began collecting and distributing new varieties of seeds and plants through members of the Congress and local agricultural societies. In 1839, Congress established the Agricultural Division within the Patent Office and allotted $1,000 for \"the collection of agricultural statistics and other agricultural purposes.\"[9] Ellsworth's interest in aiding agriculture was evident in his annual reports that called for a public depository to preserve and distribute the various new seeds and plants, a clerk to collect agricultural statistics, the preparation of statewide reports about crops in different regions, and the application of chemistry to agriculture.[citation needed] Ellsworth was called the \"Father of the Department of Agriculture.\"[10]\nIn 1849, the Patent Office was transferred to the newly created Department of the Interior. In the ensuing years, agitation for a separate bureau within the department or a separate department devoted to agriculture kept recurring.[11]\nOn May 15, 1862, Abraham Lincoln established the independent Department of Agriculture through the Morrill Act to be headed by a commissioner without Cabinet status. Staffed by only eight employees, the Department was charged with conducting research and development related to \"agriculture, rural development, aquaculture and human nutrition in the most general and comprehensive sense of those terms\".[12] Agriculturalist Isaac Newton was appointed to be the first commissioner.[13]  Lincoln called it the \"people's department\", owing to the fact that over half of the nation at the time was directly or indirectly involved in agriculture or agribusiness.[14]\nIn 1868, the department moved into the new Department of Agriculture Building in Washington, designed by famed D.C. architect Adolf Cluss. Located on the National Mall between 12th Street and 14th SW, the department had offices for its staff and the entire width of the Mall up to B Street NW to plant and experiment with plants.[15]\nIn the 1880s, varied advocacy groups were lobbying for Cabinet representation. Business interests sought a Department of Commerce and Industry, and farmers tried to raise the Department of Agriculture to Cabinet rank. In 1887, the House of Representatives and Senate passed separate bills giving Cabinet status to the Department of Agriculture and Labor, but the bill was defeated in conference committee after farm interests objected to the addition of labor. Finally, in 1889 the Department of Agriculture was given cabinet-level status.[16]\nIn 1887, the Hatch Act provided for the federal funding of agricultural experiment stations in each state. The Smith-Lever Act of 1914 then funded cooperative extension services in each state to teach agriculture, home economics, and other subjects to the public. With these and similar provisions, the USDA reached out to every county of every state.[17]\nBy 1933 the department was well established in Washington and very well known in rural America. In the agricultural field the picture was different. Statisticians created a comprehensive data-gathering arm in the Division of Crop and Livestock Estimates. Secretary Henry Wallace, a statistician, further strengthened the expertise by introducing sampling techniques. Professional economists ran a strong Bureau of Agricultural Economics. Most important was the agricultural experiment station system, a network of state partners in the land-grant colleges, which in turn operated a large field service in direct contact with farmers in practically every rural county. The department worked smoothly with a nationwide, well-organized pressure group, the American Farm Bureau Federation. It represented the largest commercial growers before Congress.[18]\nAs late as the Great Depression, farm work occupied a fourth of Americans. Indeed, many young people who moved to the cities in the prosperous 1920s returned to the family farm after the depression caused unemployment after 1929. The USDA helped ensure that food continued to be produced and distributed to those who needed it, assisted with loans for small landowners, and provided technical advice. Its Bureau of Home Economics, established in 1923, published shopping advice and recipes to stretch family budgets and make food go farther.[19]\nIt was revealed on August 27, 2018, that the U.S. Department of Agriculture would be providing U.S. farmers with a farm aid package, which will total $4.7 billion in direct payments to American farmers. This package is meant to offset the losses farmers are expected to incur from retaliatory tariffs placed on American exports during the Trump tariffs.[20]\nUSDA's offices and agencies are listed below, with full-time equivalent staff levels according to the estimated FY2019 appropriation, as reported in USDA's FY2020 Congressional Budget Justification.[1]\nSecretary of Agriculture\nUnder Secretary for Farm Production and Conservation\nUnder Secretary for Rural Development\nUnder Secretary for Food, Nutrition, and Consumer Services\nUnder Secretary for Food Safety\nUnder Secretary for Natural Resources and Environment\nUnder Secretary for Marketing and Regulatory Programs\nUnder Secretary for Research, Education, and Economics\nAllegations have been made that throughout the agency's history its personnel have discriminated against farmers of various backgrounds, denying them loans and access to other programs well into the 1990s.[23] The effect of this discrimination has been the reduction in the number of African American farmers in the United States.[24] Though African American farmers have been the most hit by discriminatory actions by the USDA, women, Native Americans, Hispanics, and other minorities have experienced discrimination in a variety of forms at the hands of the USDA. The majority of these discriminatory actions have occurred through the Farm Service Agency, which oversees loan and assistance programs to farmers.[25]\nIn response to the Supreme Court's ruling of unconstitutionality of the Agricultural Adjustment Act, Congress enacted the Soil Conservation and Domestic Allotment Act of 1936, which established the Soil Conservation Service (SCS) which provided service to private landowners and encouraged subsidies that would relieve soil from excessive farming. The SCS in its early days were hesitant, especially in Southern jurisdictions, to hire Black conservationists. Rather than reaching out to Black students in universities for interviews and job opportunities, students had to reach out for the few opportunities granted to Black conservationists.[26]\nAs part of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, the USDA formally ended racial segregation among its staff.[27]In the 1999 Pigford v. Glickman class-action lawsuit brought by African American farmers, the USDA agreed to a billion-dollar settlement due to its patterns of discrimination in the granting of loans and subsidies to black farmers.[27] In 2011, a second round of payouts, Pigford II, was appropriated by Congress for $1.25 billion, although this payout, far too late to support the many who desperately needed financial assistance during 1999 lawsuit, only comes out to around $250,000 per farmer.[28]\nA March 17, 2006 letter from the GAO about the Pigford Settlement indicated that \"the court noted that USDA disbanded its Office of Civil Rights in 1983, and stopped responding to claims of discrimination.\"[29]\nFollowing long-standing concerns, black farmers joined a class action discrimination suit against the USDA filed in federal court in 1997.[30] An attorney called it \"the most organized, largest civil rights case in the history of the country.\"[31] Also in 1997, black farmers from at least five states held protests in front of the USDA headquarters in Washington, D.C.[32] Protests in front of the USDA were a strategy employed in later years as the black farmers sought to keep national attention focused on the plight of the black farmers. Representatives of the National Black Farmers Association met with President Bill Clinton and other administration officials at the White House. And NBFA's president testified before the United States House Committee on Agriculture.[33]\nIn Pigford v. Glickman, U.S. Federal District Court Judge Paul L. Friedman approved the settlement and consent decree on April 14, 1999.[30] The settlement recognized discrimination against 22,363 black farmers, but the NBFA would later call the agreement incomplete because more than 70,000 were excluded.[34] Nevertheless, the settlement was deemed to be the largest-ever civil rights class action settlement in American history. Lawyers estimated the value of the settlement to be more than $2 billion.[35] Some farmers would have their debts forgiven.[36] Judge Friedman appointed a monitor to oversee the settlement.[35] Farmers in Alabama, Mississippi, Arkansas, and Georgia were among those affected by the settlement.[37]\nThe NBFA's president was invited to testify before congress on this matter numerous times following the settlement, including before the United States Senate Committee on Agriculture on September 12, 2000, when he testified that many farmers had not yet received payments and others were left out of the settlement. It was later revealed that one DoJ staff \"general attorney\" was unlicensed while she was handling black farmers' cases.[38] NBFA called for all those cases to be reheard.[39] The Chicago Tribune reported in 2004 that the result of such longstanding USDA discrimination was that black farmers had been forced out of business at a rate three times faster than white farmers. In 1920, 1 in 7 U.S. farmers was African-American, and by 2004 the number was 1 in 100. USDA spokesman Ed Loyd, when acknowledging that the USDA loan process was unfair to minority farmers, had claimed it was hard to determine the effect on such farmers.[40]\nIn 2006 the Government Accountability Office (GAO) issued a report highly critical of the USDA in its handling of the black farmers cases.[41] NBFA continued to lobby Congress to provide relief. NBFA's Boyd secured congressional support for legislation that would provide $100 million in funds to settle late-filer cases. In 2006 a bill was introduced into the House of Representatives and later the Senate by Senator George Felix Allen.[42] In 2007 Boyd testified before the United States House Committee on the Judiciary about this legislation.[citation needed] As the organization was making headway by gathering Congressional supporters in 2007 it was revealed that some USDA Farm Services Agency employees were engaged in activities aimed at blocking Congressional legislation that would aid the black farmers.[43] President Barack Obama, then a U.S. Senator, lent his support to the black farmers' issues in 2007.[44] A bill co-sponsored by Obama passed the Senate in 2007.[45]\nIn early June 2008 hundreds of black farmers, denied a chance to have their cases heard in the Pigford settlement, filed a new lawsuit against USDA.[46] The Senate and House versions of the black farmers bill, reopening black farmers discrimination cases, became law in June 2008.[47] Some news reports said that the new law could affect up to 74,000 black farmers.[48] In October 2008, the GAO issued a report criticizing the USDA's handling of discrimination complaints.[49] The GAO recommended an oversight review board to examine civil rights complaints.[50]\nAfter numerous public rallies and an intensive NBFA member lobbying effort, Congress approved and Obama signed into law in December 2010 legislation that set aside $1.15 billion to resolve the outstanding black farmers' cases.[51] NBFA's John W. Boyd, Jr., attended the bill-signing ceremony at the White House.[citation needed] As of 2013, 90,000 African-American, Hispanic, female and Native American farmers had filed claims. It was reported that some had been found fraudulent, or transparently bogus. In Maple Hill, North Carolina by 2013, the number of successful claimants was four times the number of farms with 1 out of 9 African-Americans being paid, while \"claimants were not required [by the USDA] to present documentary evidence that they had been unfairly treated or had even tried to farm.\" Lack of documentation is an issue complicated by the USDA practice of discarding denied applications after three years.[52]\nIn 1999, Native American farmers, discriminated in a similar fashion to black farmers, filed a class-action lawsuit against the USDA alleging loan discrimination under the ECOA and the APA. This case relied heavily on its predecessor, Pigford v. Glickman, in terms of the reasoning it set forth in the lawsuit.[25] Eventually, a settlement was reached between the plaintiffs and the USDA to the amount of up to $760 million, awardable through individual damages claims.[53] These claims could be used for monetary relief, debt relief, and/or tax relief. The filing period began June 29, 2011 and lasted 180 days.[54] Track A claimants would be eligible for up to $50,000, whereas Track B claimants would be eligible for up to $250,000 with a higher standard of proof.[55]\nIn 2000, similar to Pigford v. Glickman, a class-action lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia on behalf of Hispanic farmers alleging that the USDA discriminated against them in terms of credit transactions and disaster benefits, in direct violation of ECOA. As per the settlement, $1.33 billion is available for compensation in awards of up to $50,000 or $250,000, while an additional $160 million is available in debt relief.[56]\nIn 2001, similar to Garcia v. Vilsack, a class-action lawsuit was filed in the same court alleging discrimination on the basis of gender. A Congressional response to the lawsuit resulted in the passing of the Equality for Women Farmers Act, which created a system that would allow for allegations of gender discrimination to be heard against the USDA and enable claims for damages.[57]\nIn their 2012 environmental justice strategy, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) stated an ongoing desire to integrate environmental justice into its core mission and operations. In 2011, Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack emphasized the USDA's focus on EJ in rural communities around the United States, as well as connecting with Indigenous Tribes and ensuring they understand and receive their environmental rights. USDA does fund programs with social and environmental equity goals; however, it has no staff dedicated solely to EJ.\nOn February 16, 1994, President Clinton issued Executive Order 12898, \"Federal Actions to Address Environmental Justice in Minority Populations and Low-Income Populations.\" Executive Order 12898 requires that achieving EJ must be part of each federal agency's mission. Under Executive Order 12898 federal agencies must:\nThe Executive Order also created an Interagency Working Group (IWG) consisting of 11 heads of departments and agencies.[58]\nOn February 7, 2012, the USDA released a final Environmental Justice Strategic Plan identifying new and updated goals and performance measures beyond what USDA identified in a 1995 EJ strategy that was adopted in response to E.O. 12898.[59] Generally, USDA believes its existing technical and financial assistance programs provide solutions to environmental inequity, such as its initiatives on education, food deserts, and economic development in impacted communities.\nNatural Resources and Environment Under Secretary Harris Sherman is the political appointee generally responsible for USDA's EJ strategy, with Patrick Holmes, a senior staffer to the Under Secretary, playing a coordinating role. USDA has no staff dedicated solely to EJ.[60]\nUSDA has had a role in implementing Michelle Obama's Let's Move campaign in tribal areas by increasing Bureau of Indian Education schools' participation in federal nutrition programs, by developing community gardens on tribal lands, and developing tribal food policy councils.[61]\nMore than $6.2 billion in Rural Development funding has been allocated for community infrastructure in Indian country and is distributed via 47 state offices that altogether cover the entire continental United States, Hawaii, and Alaska.[60] Such funding has been used for a variety of reasons:\nRural housing:\n-single-family housing direct loans\n-loan guarantees loans for very-low-income homeowners\n-financing for affordable rental housing\n-financing for farm laborers and their families\nCommunity facilities:\n-child and senior care centers\n-emergency services\n-healthcare institutions\n-educational institutions\n-tribal administration buildings\nBusiness and cooperative programs:\n-increased access to broadband connections\n-tribal workplace development and employment opportunities\n-sustainable renewable energy development\n-regional food systems\n-financing and technical assistance for entrepreneurs, including loans and lending\n-increased access to capital through Tribal CDFIs\nUtilities:\n-increased access to 21st century telecommunications services\n-reliable and affordable water and wastewater systems\n-financing electric systems\n-integrating electric smart-grid technologies[62]\nIn 1997, the U.S. Forest Service (USFS) published a resource guide aimed at helping USFS officials with developing and maintaining relations with different tribal governments. To that end, and in coordination with the Forest Service's 4-point American Indian/Alaska Native policy, the resource guide discusses how to:\nThe USFS works to maintain good governmental relationships through regular intergovernmental meetings, acknowledgement of pre-existing tribal sovereignty, and a better general understanding of tribal government, which varies from tribe to tribe. Indian treaty rights and trust responsibilities are honored through visits to tribal neighbors, discussions of mutual interest, and attempts to honor and accommodate the legal positions of Indians and the federal government. Addressing and demonstrating sensitivity to Native religious beliefs and practices includes walking through Native lands and acknowledging cultural needs when implementing USFS activities. Providing research, technology, and assistance to Indian governments is shown through collaboration of ecological studies and sharing of various environmental technologies, as well as the inclusion of traditional Native practices in contemporary operations of the USFS.[63]\nThe Intertribal Technical Assistance Network works to improve access of tribal governments, communities and individuals to USDA technical assistance programs.[64]\nThe Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service provides APHIS Veterinary Services, which serve the tribal community by promoting and fostering safe animal trade and care. This includes prevention of pests and disease from herd and fisheries as well as surveys for diseases on or near Native American lands that can affected traditionally hunted wildlife.[65] The APHIS also provides Wildlife Services, which help with wildlife damage on Native lands. This includes emergency trainings, outreach, consultation, internship opportunities for students, and general education on damage reduction, livestock protection, and disease monitoring.[66]\nMeanwhile, the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) is exploring a program to use meat from bisons raised on tribal land to supply AMS food distribution programs to tribes.[60]\nThe NRCS Strike Force Initiative has identified impoverished counties in Mississippi, Georgia and Arkansas to receive increased outreach and training regarding USDA assistance programs. USDA credits this increased outreach with generating a 196 percent increase in contracts, representing more than 250,000 acres of farmland, in its Environmental Quality Incentives Program.[64] In 2001, NRCS funded and published a study, \"Environmental Justice: Perceptions of Issues, Awareness and Assistance,\" focused on rural, Southern \"Black Belt\" counties and analyzing how the NRCS workforce could more effectively integrate environmental justice into impacted communities.[67]\nThe Farm Services Agency in 2011 devoted $100,000 of its Socially Disadvantaged Farmers and Ranchers program budget to improving its outreach to counties with persistent poverty.[68] USDA's Risk Management Agency has initiated education and outreach to low-income farmers regarding use of biological controls, rather than pesticides, for pest control.[60] The Rural Utilities Service administers water and wastewater loans, including SEARCH Grants that are targeted to financially distressed, small rural communities and other opportunities specifically for Alaskan Native villages.[69][70]\nUSFS has established several Urban Field Stations, to research urban natural resources' structure, function, stewardship, and benefits.[71] By mapping urban tree coverage, the agency hopes to identify and prioritize EJ communities for urban forest projects.[71]\nAnother initiative highlighted by the agency is the Food and Nutrition Service and Economic Research Service's Food Desert Locator.[72] The Locator provides a spatial view of food deserts, defined as a low-income census tract where a substantial number or share of residents has low access to a supermarket or large grocery store. The mapped deserts can be used to direct agency resources to increase access to fresh fruits and vegetables and other food assistance programs.[73]\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, Congress allocated funding to the USDA to address the disturbances rippling through the agricultural sector. On April 17, 2020, U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue announced the Coronavirus Food Assistance Program:[74]\nThe American food supply chain had to adapt, and it remains safe, secure, and strong, and we all know that starts with America's farmers and ranchers. This program will not only provide immediate relief for our farmers and ranchers, but it will also allow for the purchase and distribution of our agricultural abundance to help our fellow Americans in need.\nThis provided $16 billion for farmers and ranchers, and $3 billion to purchase surplus produce, dairy, and meat from farmers for distribution to charitable organizations.[75] As part of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES) and the Families First Coronavirus Response Act (FFCRA), USDA has up to an additional $873.3 million available in Section 32 funding to purchase a variety of agricultural products for distribution to food banks, $850 million for food bank administrative costs and USDA food purchases.[75]\nImportant legislation setting policy of the USDA includes the:[citation needed]\nHemp for Victory, a short documentary produced by the department during World War II\nA guide to improving farmhouse kitchens, put out by the department's Institute of Home Economics, Agricultural Research Service, in 1952\nA guide to making clothes, put out by the Institute of Home Economics in 1959\nThe Secretary of Agriculture's office is located in the Jamie L.
