            "report_content": "Watch CBSN Live\nBy David Morgan\nUpdated on:  December 5, 2021 / 12:40 PM\n          / CBS NEWS\nA look back at the esteemed personalities who left us this year, who'd touched us with their innovation, creativity and humanity.\nBy CBSNews.com senior producer David Morgan. The Associated Press contributed to this gallery.\nAuthor Anne Rice (October 4, 1941-December 11, 2021) was born into a strict Catholic family, and was given her father's name: Howard Allen O'Brien. (She would choose the name Anne for herself as a child.) Her mother died from complications of alcoholism when Anne was a teenager. In 2006 Rice told \"Sunday Morning\" that, back in the 1950s, alcoholism was considered a disease: \"The one time she talked to me about it, she described it that way, as a craving in the blood. That's what she said it was. She asked me to say the Rosary with her.\"\nShe left Catholicism as a youngster when she could not reconcile the forbidding of books: \"I stopped believing in my church, and then I stopped believing in God. I think the two were very intimately connected for me.\"\nThe subject matter of her debut novel, \"Interview With the Vampire,\" from 1973, came while mourning the death of her six-year-old daughter, Michelle, from leukemia. \"The vampire was the perfect metaphor for the way I felt. I felt like a lost person, a person in the dark, a person who was trying to find meaning in life, trying to find context.\n\"It was just something I tried one night. I was just sitting at the typewriter, and I thought, 'Well, let me give this a try. What would it be like if you could get a vampire to tell you what his experiences were, like an interview with the vampire?'\"\nThe book spurred a long list of novels in what came to be known as \"The Vampire Chronicles.\" There were also books on witches, werewolves and seraphims, as well as erotic novels published under pseudonyms, and they were translated to movies and the stage. To date, her books have sold more than 150 million copies worldwide. [\"Ramses the Damned: The Reign of Osiris\" will be published posthumously in February 2022.]\nAfter nearly four decades as an avowed atheist writing about vampires, Rice returned to the Catholic Church, and began writing about Jesus. Her 2005 novel, \"Christ the Lord: Out of Egypt,\" told the story of Jesus as a child. She explained to \"Sunday Morning\" that her goal with the book was \"to make you believe. I'm going to use every skill that I ever used to make you believe in vampires and witches – so that you call me at home and night and ask me if they're really real – I'm going to use that same skill to make you believe that Jesus is the son of God. That's my mission.\"\nFour years later, she announced that she was no longer Christian. She explained her shifting belief: \"I refuse to be anti-gay. I refuse to be anti-feminist. I refuse to be anti-artificial birth control.\"\nShe told the Associated Press, \"I believed for a long time that the differences, the quarrels among Christians didn't matter a lot for the individual, that you live your life and stay out of it. But then I began to realize that it wasn't an easy thing to do … I came to the conclusion that if I didn't make this declaration, I was going to lose my mind.\"\nIn 1966 musician and songwriter Michael Nesmith (December 30, 1942-December 10, 2021), who had written such songs as \"Different Drummer\" (later recorded by Linda Ronstadt and the Stone Poneys), was playing at the Troubadour in  West Hollywood when a friend told him about an ad in Variety seeking \"four insane boys.\" The ensuing NBC musical-comedy series \"The Monkees\" – a mix of The Beatles and the Marx Brothers – four madcap musicians (Nesmith, Davy Jones., Micky Dolenz and Peter Tork) would turn pop culture upside-down.\nTheir first four albums went to #1, and in 1967 this \"made for TV\" band, somewhat derisively dubbed the Prefab Four, would outsell The Beatles and The Rolling Stones. Their hits included \"Daydream Believer,\" \"Last Train to Clarksville,\" \"I'm a Believer,\" \"Pleasant Valley Sunday\" and \"Valleri.\" Goofy scripts, catchy music, and their endearing personalities – showcased by the show's vigorous editing that pre-dated MTV and music videos – helped \"The Monkees\" win an Emmy for Outstanding Comedy Series.\nBut the four would butt heads with the show's music producer, Don Kirshner, who used outside session musicians to make The Monkees' first two albums. When the show's fictional band became a phenomenon, the producers finally allowed them to play; their third album, \"Headquarters,\" was entirely their own.\nIn 2016 Nesmith told \"Sunday Morning\" correspondent Anthony Mason of the producer's somewhat dismissive attitude. \"Bob Rafelson said, 'Well, we coulda hired any four guys.' I said, 'Yeah, but you didn't. You hired us four.' And he said, 'Well, but any four guys could do what you're doin'. I said, 'No, they couldn't have. Because what we are, we bought the force of our character to it.'\"\nThe series ended after just two seasons, and the gang appeared in the psychedelic musical-comedy \"Head,\" written by Rafelson and Jack Nicholson. Though a box office failure, the film grew into a cult favorite.\nThe Monkees eventually went their separate ways. Nesmith started his own group, the First National Band, and was executive producer of the cult film \"Repo Man.\" His 1981 Pacific Arts production, \"Elephants Parts,\" won the first Grammy Award for Long-form Music Video. He also developed a virtual reality performance space, and authored a novel and a memoir, \"Infinite Tuesday.\"\nBut reruns have kept reintroducing The Monkees to new audiences. The surviving members performed together on tour, and for their 50th anniversary put out a new album, \"Good Times!\"\nItalian filmmaker Lina Wertmüller (August 14, 1928-December 9, 2021) was the first woman to receive an Academy Award nomination for best director, for her wartime comic-drama, \"Seven Beauties.\"\nAttracted to cinema, comic books and Russian drama from a young age, Wertmüller started her career in theater until becoming an acolyte of Federico Fellini, working as his assistant on \"8½.\" She began writing and directing films and TV programs in the 1960s, sometimes under a pseudonym (her 1968 spaghetti western, \"The Belle Star Story,\" is one example), typically exploring politics, wealth, class and sex.\nShe also started a long collaboration with actor Giancarlo Giannini, whom she directed in nine films, including 1975's \"Seven Beauties,\" in which he played a Neopolitan who kills a pimp, becomes an army deserter, and then debases himself and commits murder in order to survive a Nazi prison camp. The performance earned Giannini an Oscar nomination as well. He also starred in Wertmüller's \"Swept Away\" (1974), a battle of the sexes between a wealthy woman and a Communist sailor who are stranded on an island.\nHer later films drew less critical attention, but she continued to work with such internationally-renowned actors as Sophia Loren (\"Saturday, Sunday and Monday\"), Marcello Mastroianni (\"Blood Feud\"), Harvey Keitel (\"Camorra\"), Candice Bergen (\"A Night Full of Rain\"), Nastassja Kinski and Rutger Hauer (\"Up to Date\"), and F. Murray Abraham (\"Too Much Romance... It's Time for Stuffed Peppers\").\nShe received a lifetime achievement Oscar in 2019.\nIn a 2017 interview for the Criterion Collection, Wertmüller dismissed the distinction she'd earned as the first woman to be up for a best director Oscar. \"I've never endorsed the feminist movement,\" she said. \"I consider myself a director, not a female director. I think there's no difference. The difference is between good movies and bad movies. We should not make other distinctions.\"\n2021 would see the deaths of three members of an elite auto racing family. In addition to Bobby Unser and his son, Bobby Unser Jr. (who passed six weeks after his father), Al Unser (May 29, 1939-December 9, 2021), one of only four drivers to win the Indianapolis 500 a record four times, died.\nAl won the Indy 500 in 1970, 1971, 1978, and 1987, at age 47, making him the oldest winner in Indy 500 history. He is also the only driver in history to have both a sibling and a child also win one of the biggest races in the world. He made 27 starts in the Indy 500, the third most in history.\nHe and son Al Jr. were the first father-son pairing at Indianapolis, and in 1985 they battled one another for the CART championship, which the elder Unser won by a single point. He fought back tears while describing the \"empty feeling\" of defeating his son.\nUnser also ran five NASCAR races in his career, finishing fourth in the 1968 Daytona 500. He earned three top-10 finishes in NASCAR. He also won three times in the International Race of Champions, an all-star series that pitted the top drivers from various disciplines against each other.\nUnser was inducted into the Indianapolis Motor Speedway Hall of Fame in 1986 and the International Motorsports Hall of Fame in 1998. His collection of trophies and cars is housed at the Unser Racing Museum in Albuquerque.\nThe Kansas-born Robert Dole (July 22, 1923-December 5, 2021) was a high school athlete who wanted to be a doctor, but World War II intervened. A young Army Captain, he was advancing against Nazi fortifications in Italy when he was hit by gunfire. He lay on the battlefield for 10 hours. His terrible wounds, from which he spent three years recuperating, would cost him the use of his right arm.\nThe support from his hometown, he told \"Sunday Morning\" in 2021, was symbolized by a cigar box: \"My friends in Dawson's Drugstore in Russell, Kansas, when they heard that I was wounded, they passed the box around and kept it on the counter, and asked people to give money.\"\nHe said he decided on a life of public service while still recovering from his wounds: \"I figured out that lying in bed the rest of my life was not an option,\" Dole told \"Sunday Morning\" correspondent Rita Braver.\nIn 1950 Dole was elected to the Kansas House of Representatives, and, after a stint as County Attorney of Russell County, was elected to the House in 1960, and later the Senate. He was President Gerald Ford's VP pick when he ran for election in 1976. They lost that contest, and Dole was unsuccessful when he sought the Republican presidential nomination in 1980 and '88.\nHe spent 27 years in the Senate but resigned, quitting his post as Majority Leader, when he ran against President Bill Clinton in 1996, becoming the last presidential candidate to have served in World War II. He lost, but as his wife, Elizabeth (who later became a Senator herself) said, \"Bob Dole is a fighter. You can't hold him down. He's going to bounce back. The third day after he had lost the election, he goes on the Letterman show.\"\nDavid Letterman: \"Bob, what have you been doing lately?\"Dole:  \"Apparently, not enough, in any event!\"\nDole nonetheless became a familiar face as a TV pundit, including in 2003 as a dueling commentator with former President Clinton on \"60 Minutes.\" He was also a lobbyist, a fundraiser for the National World War II Memorial, an advocate for people with disabilities, and an unlikely pitchman (for Pepsi, Visa, and even Viagra).\nAmong the honors presented to Dole were the Presidential Medal of Freedom and the Congressional Gold Medal.\nDole once said, \"My pledge one time was to make a difference in the life of at least one person every day. Now, I probably failed part of that, but I still work at it.\"\nThe last surviving officer of Easy Company, whose exploits were recounted in the book and HBO miniseries, \"Band of Brothers,\" Edward Shames (June 13, 1922-December 3, 2021) was involved in some of the most important battles of World War II. An operations sergeant, he was still 21 years old when he parachuted into Normandy on D-Day, after which he received a battlefield commission to second lieutenant, and took charge of Easy Company. He fought in Operation Market Garden, Operation Pegasus (a rescue mission that saved 125 trapped British troops), and the Battle of the Bulge. He was also the first member of the 101st Airborne to enter the Nazi concentration camp at Dachau, shortly after its liberation.\nAccording to his obituary, when Easy Company entered Hitler's \"Eagle's Nest,\" near the town of Berchtesgaden, Shames acquired a few bottles of cognac that were labeled \"for the Fuhrer's use only.\" It was with this cognac that Shames toasted his oldest son's Bar Mitzvah.\nIn a 2006 interview for Military History magazine, Shames explained his reputation as a \"screamer\" to his men, demanding not just \"discipline,\" but \"perfection.\"\n\"I'm sure that the men didn't love me. I didn't want them to love me; I wanted them to respect me. … This is why I brought more men home than most of the officers in the 506th. I was the only second lieutenant in the regiment who was a platoon leader, and in contrast to the other officers in the 506th, they didn't even relieve me once. I must have been doing something right.\"\nAt a reunion in 2002, he recalled, one of his men complimented him: \"He said, 'Shames, you are the meanest, roughest, son of a bitch I've ever had to deal with. But you brought us home.'\"\nFollowing the war, Shames worked as an expert on Middle East affairs for the National Security Agency, and served in the U.S. Army Reserve Division. He retired as a colonel.\nBorn in Minneapolis, Arlene Dahl (August 11, 1925-November 29, 2021) became stage-struck as a child, and headed to New York to embark on a modeling and acting career. Her charm and flaming red hair became sought-after in Hollywood.\nIn a 2015 interview for Mesquite Local News, Dahl recalled Jack Warner inviting her to Hollywood for a screen test after seeing her sing and dance on Broadway in \"Mr. Strauss Goes to Boston,\" in 1945. She declined, expecting the show to have a long run. \"He said, 'Give it two or three weeks and you'll call me; here's my card.' He was right. I was soon out of a job.\" \"Mr. Strauss Goes to Boston\" closed after 12 performances, and Dahl was signed by Warner Brothers.\nShe appeared in the 1947 musical \"My Wild Irish Rose,\" before moving to MGM, starring in 1948's \"A Southern Yankee\" and \"The Outriders.\" She sang and danced in the 1950 musical biopic \"Three Little Words,\" but she was also adept at comedies, noirish dramas and westerns, starring in \"Here Come the Girls,\" \"Watch the Birdie,\" \"Caribbean,\" \"Jamaica Run,\" \"Reign of Terror,\" \"Bengal Brigade,\" \"She Played With Fire,\" and \"Scene of the Crime.\"\nPerhaps her most memorable role was in the 1959 Jules Verne epic, \"Journey to the Center of the Earth,\" accompanying James Mason, Pat Boone and a goose into the bowels of the planet.\nMarried six times (including to actors Fernando Lamas and Lex Barker), Dahl later returned to Broadway, playing Margo Channing in \"Applause,\" and spent three years on the soap opera \"One Life to Live.\" Other TV credits included \"The Love Boat,\" \"Fantasy Island,\" \"All My Children,\" and \"Love, American Style.\" She guest-starred in two '90s TV series starring her son, Lorenzo Lamas: \"Renegade\" and \"Air America.\"\nDahl also penned a syndicated beauty column, and several books, including, \"Always Ask a Man: Arlene Dahl's Key to Femininity\"; \"Beyond Beauty\"; \"Arlene Dahl's Lovescopes\"; \"Secrets of Hair Care\"; and \"Your Beauty Scope.\" She also designed perfume, lingerie and exercise outfits.\nCelebrated fashion designer Virgil Abloh (September 30, 1980-November 28, 2021), one of the most powerful Black executives in an industry historically closed to Blacks, had no formal fashion training (he had a degree in engineering, and a master's in architecture), but he was taught to sew by his seamstress mother.\nIn 2009, Abloh worked as creative director for Kanye West, and as art director for the 2011 West-Jay-Z album \"Watch the Throne,\" for which Abloh was nominated for a Grammy.\nIn 2013 he founded the Off-White label, and partnered with Nike to produce a line of sneakers. Abloh also designed furniture for IKEA; refillable bottles for Evian; and Big Mac cartons for McDonald's. His work has been exhibited at the Louvre, Gagosian London, and the Museum of Contemporary Art Chicago.\nAfter being named artistic director for Louis Vuitton's menswear – the first Black artistic director of men's wear in the French design house's history – Abloh was chosen one of Time magazine's most influential people in 2018.\nIn a 2019 interview with Vogue, Abloh discussed his work, which builds upon and combines existing forms, concepts and typography; he has been praised as a disruptive influencer and criticized as an appropriator. \"That way of designing – to develop everything from zero – comes from a different time. For me, design is about whatever I find is worthy to tell a story about. I don't believe that culture benefits from the idea that this line on a piece of paper has never been drawn in this exact way ever before. My goal is to highlight things – that's why I collaborate a lot, that's why I reference a lot, and that's what makes my body of work what it is.\"\nAn orphan at age 9, Lee Elder (July 14, 1934-November 28, 2021) got into golf as a caddie, and polished his game while serving in the Army and, after discharge, joining the United Golf Association tour for Black players. [At the time the PGA was only open to Whites.] One of the UGA's best players, Elder won 18 tournaments. After attending the PGA qualifying school, he earned entry for the 1968 tour. During his rookie year he strode into a sudden-death playoff against Jack Nicklaus at the American Golf Classic, losing after five extra holes.\nAfter winning the PGA's Monsanto Open in 1974, he made history the following year at Augusta National, when he received an invitation, at age 40, to play at the Masters, which until then had been an all-White tournament. He missed the cut while receiving death threats and racist taunts, and was forced to rent two houses to increase his security.\nIn a 2019 interview with Golf Digest, Elder recalled his initial round at Augusta: \"Most of the staff was Black, and on Friday, they left their duties to line the 18th fairway as I walked toward the green. The other patrons cleared the way for them to come to the front, and they were instantly recognizable by their uniforms. This took planning on the part of the employees and moved me very deeply. I couldn't hold back the tears. One club employee shouted in this booming voice that rose above the applause, 'Thank you for coming, Mr. Elder!' Other employees, taking his cue, shouted the same thing. Of all the acknowledgements of what I had accomplished by getting there, this one meant the most.\"\nHe would play in the Masters five more times between 1977 and 1981, and his presence proved groundbreaking for other non-White players, including Tiger Woods. Elder notched four wins on the PGA Tour, four tournaments internationally, and in the 1980s won five tournaments on the Senior PGA Tour.\nFor many years Elder also managed the Langston Golf Course in a historically Black neighborhood in Northeast Washington, D.C.\nHis advice for players? \"Choose one department of the game and get good at it before branching out. It can be any part – I suggest pitching with a sand wedge – but don't try to swallow the whole game at once. If you try to learn driving, sand play, fairway woods and putting at the same time, the game will eat you up. You'll get frustrated and might quit. Build up confidence in that one area, and then let it spread out to the other parts.\"\nThe composer and/or lyricist of some of Broadway's most revolutionary and artistically challenging musicals, Stephen Sondheim (March 22, 1930-November 26, 2021) is credited with helping to reinvent musical theater – a giant of the stage whose distinctive artistic temperament would give life to such shows as \"West Side Story,\" \"Gypsy,\" \"Company,\" \"Follies,\" \"A Little Night Music,\" \"Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street,\" \"Sunday in the Park With George,\" and \"Into the Woods.\"\nAs a youngster, Sondheim and his family were friends with Broadway titan Oscar Hammerstein, who became a father figure and mentor to Stephen. In 2002 Sondheim told \"Sunday Morning\" correspondent Martha Teichner that if it hadn't been for Hammerstein, he probably would have become a mathematician. But he also took to heart Hammerstein's advice to his protégé: \"Don't copy me. Be true to yourself.\"\nA graduate of Williams College in Massachusetts, Sondheim learned at the knee of Hammerstein, and from avant-garde composer Milton Babbitt, and he brought to his work a playful precision and a love of word games and puzzles that would color his output (including, in 1973, a screenplay for the twisting murder mystery, \"The Last of Sheila\").\nHe'd contributed one song to the 1956 play \"Girls of Summer\" before he began collaborating with composer Leonard Bernstein on \"West Side Story,\" an updated telling of \"Romeo & Juliet\" via rival street gangs in Manhattan. Sondheim's lyrics for such songs as \"Something's Coming,\" \"Maria,\" \"Tonight,\" \"America,\" \"Cool\" and \"I Feel Pretty\" were sharp, pungent and – combined with Bernstein's vibrant music – timeless.\nHe followed with another collaboration, with composer Jule Styne: \"Gypsy,\" starring Ethel Merman. But it was for the 1963 comedy \"A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum,\" for which Sondheim crafted both words and music, that he won his first Tony Award. Starring Zero Mostel, it would also prove one of the longest-running of his shows, with 964 performances.\nThough most of Sondheim's musicals were not overpowering box office successes – not of \"The Lion King\" variety, at any rate – he drew passionate audiences who were not dissuaded by dark properties that commented on race, class or politics, with music that did not bow to Tin Pan Alley traditions. One of his most memorable songs, \"Send in the Clowns,\" from \"A Little Night Music,\" is melancholic to the extreme. (The show was inspired by an Ingmar Bergman film, \"Smiles of a Summer Night.\") And in the kabuki-style \"Pacific Overtures,\" Sondheim's lyrics offer an acerbic view of the 19th century opening of Japan to the West:\nIn the middle of the world we float In the middle of the sea The realities remain remote In the middle of the sea Kings are burning somewhere Wheels are turning somewhere Trains are being run, wars are being won Things are being done somewhere out there Not here Here, we paint screens\nBeginning in the 1970s, Sondheim teamed with director Hal Prince on some of his most innovative shows, including \"Follies,\" \"A Little Night Music,\" and \"Sweeney Todd,\" the grimly delicious tale of a murderous barber seeking revenge, and the meat pie baker who helpfully disposes of his victims.\nThough \"Merrily We Roll Along,\" a story of friends told going backwards in time, would prove a difficult show (it was retooled and re-staged several times), Sondheim followed with \"Sunday in the Park With George,\" a study of the creative process, told through the works of Impressionist artist Georges Seurat and his great-grandson, also an artist. \"Into the Woods\" presented a fresh take on traditional fairy tales and their unexpected outcomes.\nOther productions included \"Anyone Can Whistle,\" which opened on April 4, 1964 and closed a week later; \"Do I Hear a Waltz?\" with composer Richard Rodgers; \"Assassins,\" a revue telling the stories of successful or attempted presidential assassins; \"Passion\" a story of obsessive love adapted from an 1869 Italian novel; and \"Road Show\" (a.k.a. \"Bounce\"), which was workshopped beginning in 1999 but did not play in New York until an Off-Broadway production opened in 2008.\nHis music has also served as the basis of several revues and compilation shows, including \"Side by Side by Sondheim,\" \"Putting It Together,\" \"Mostly Sondheim,\" and \"Sondheim on Sondheim.\" Beyond the adaptation of his works for movies, Sondheim wrote original music for the 1974 Alain Renais drama \"Stavisky,\" and the Warren Beatty films \"Reds\" and \"Dick Tracy,\" including a song for Madonna, \"Sooner or Later (I Always Get My Man\"), which won an Oscar for Best Original Song.\nSondheim has been awarded the Kennedy Center Honor and the Presidential Medal of Freedom, and in 2008 received a Tony Award for lifetime achievement – on top of the eight Tonys he'd won. He also received a Pulitzer Prize in 1985 for \"Sunday in the Park With George.\"\nIn his 70s, Sondheim told \"Sunday Morning\" the challenge of writing was not just to top yourself, but to find something fresh, \"something you haven't written before.\"\nAn act of courage? \"It sure is, and it needs more courage as you get older. And that, see, is what I didn't expect.\"\nDrummer Graeme Edge (March 30, 1941-November 11, 2021) co-founded The Moody Blues in Birmingham, England in 1964, and performed on their 16 studio albums, from \"The Magnificent Moodies\" (1965) through \"December\" (2003), the band's final release.\nTheir evolution as a prog-rock group began with their second album, \"Days of Future Passed,\" which featured the Mellotron (an analog synthesizer which incorporated tape loops). The album included orchestral arrangements of classical compositions, interpolated with rock songs, and merged with the band on \"Nights in White Satin.\" Though released in 1967 (including on quadraphonic reel tape), that song would not reach No. 2 on the U.S. Billboard charts until 1972, helped by heavy FM radio airplay, sparked by the playlists of iconoclastic DJs.\nIn 2018 Edge told Rolling Stone magazine, \"Some time later they interviewed the DJ who got it going in Seattle and he said, 'I was on the graveyard shift and I wanted to go out into the car park and smoke my bum and \"Nights in White Satin\" was long enough to smoke.' If anybody asks me, 'To what do you owe your success?' I say, 'A junkie DJ.'\"\nIn addition to drums, Edge contributed poetry to \"Days of Future Passed.\" As he told Rolling Stone, \"We had a problem as we were writing the songs. We had 'Dawn Is a Feeling' and 'Peak Hour,' but there was a big gap until 'Nights.' Being musicians, we didn't have a lot of experience after dawn and before midday! So, I was trying to write a song that spanned that [period], called 'Morning Glory,' with lyrics between morning and evening. Then I went to the guys and said, 'Can you do anything with this?' I spoke the lyric out to them and they looked at me and said, 'There are just too many words. There's no way you can sing this!' Then Tony Clarke said, 'Oh, make it a poem!'\"\nCold hearted orb that rules the night, Removes the colours from our sight, Red is gray and yellow white, But we decide which is right. And which is an illusion.\nOther albums, many featuring Edge's poetry, included \"In Search of the Lost Chord,\" \"On the Threshold of a Dream,\" \"To Our Children's Children's Children,\" \"A Question of Balance,\" \"Every Good Boy Deserves Favour,\" \"Seventh Sojourn,\" and \"Octave.\"\nThe group released several more albums in the 1980s and '90s, and had hits with the songs \"The Voice,\" \"Sitting at the Wheel,\" \"Your Wildest Dreams,\" and \"I Know You're Out There Somewhere.\" Their 1993 album, \"A Night at Red Rocks with the Colorado Symphony Orchestra,\" was certified gold.\nThe band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2018.\nGeorgia native Max Cleland (August 24, 1942-November 9, 2021), an accomplished college swimmer and basketball player, was a U.S. Army captain in Vietnam when, on April 8, 1968, he reached for a grenade he thought had fallen from his belt. \"When my eyes cleared I looked at my right hand. It was gone. Nothing but a splintered white bone protruded from my shredded elbow,\" he wrote in his 1980 memoir, \"Strong at the Broken Places.\" He lost his right arm and two legs.\nReturning home a triple-amputee, Cleland recalled in a 2002 interview being depressed about his future, but still interested in pursuing a political career: \"I sat in my mother and daddy's living room and took stock in my life. No job. No hope of a job. No offer of a job. No girlfriend. No apartment. No car. And I said, 'This is a great time to run for the state Senate.\"'\nCleland won a state Senate seat, then lost a run for lieutenant governor. In 1977 President Jimmy Carter appointed Cleland to head the Veterans Administration. While he was in charge, the VA would recognize post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) as a genuine condition, and he worked to provide veterans and their families with improved care.\nIn 1982 Cleland was elected Georgia's Secretary of State, and in 1996 he won the Senate seat of the retiring Sam Nunn. In 2002, however, he lost his re-election bid to Saxby Chambliss, when the Republican's campaign aired a commercial questioning Cleland's patriotism, alongside images of Osama bin Laden and Saddam Hussein.\nHaving lost his sense of purpose with his bitter Senate loss, Cleland wound up back at Walter Reed Army Medical Center, where he was diagnosed with PTSD. The loss, he told CBS News in 2009, \"threw me right back in war,\" prompting \"massive anxiety … powerlessness and hopelessness\" that brought back the sensation of lying bleeding on the battlefield.\nCleland recovered, and would serve as a director of the Export-Import Bank. He was later named by President Barack Obama to be secretary of the American Battle Monuments Commission.\nBeginning his acting career on Broadway at age seven, Dean Stockwell (March 5, 1936-November 7, 2021) would quit show business several times during his life. Yet he kept returning, earning praise as a character actor for his memorable performances in such films as David Lynch's \"Blue Velvet,\" Wim Wenders' \"Paris, Texas,\" Robert Altman's \"The Player,\" and Jonathan Demme's \"Married to the Mob\" (for which he earned his sole Academy Award nomination). He also received four Emmy nominations for his role as Admiral Al Calavicci, who appears as a hologram to aid the time-traveling scientist played by Scott Bakula, in the cult sci-fi series \"Quantum Leap.\"\nThe son of a stage actor, the young Stockwell's role in the Broadway play \"The Innocent Voyage\" led to an MGM contract, and roles in the films \"Anchors Aweigh,\" \"Gentlemen's Agreement,\" \"Song of the Thin Man,\" \"The Boy With Green Hair,\" \"Kim,\" \"Down to the Sea in Ships,\" \"The Secret Garden,\" and \"Stars in My Crown.\" He quit acting at age 16, but was back on Broadway a few years later, as a young killer alongside Roddy McDowell in \"Compulsion.\"\nHe earned plaudits for his mature roles in the films \"Sons and Lovers,\" the movie version of \"Compulsion,\" and Sidney Lumet's 1962 adaptation of Eugene O'Neill's \"Long Day's Journey Into Night.\" Stockwell was twice awarded best actor at the Cannes Film Festival. He also directed a program of Beckett and Ionesco plays in Los Angeles.\nIn the mid-'60s he dropped out of show business again, but was back a few years later, with appearances in \"Psych-Out,\" \"The Dunwich Horror,\" Dennis Hopper's \"The Last Movie,\" \"The Loners,\" and such TV series as \"Mannix,\" \"Mission: Impossible,\" \"Night Gallery,\" \"Columbo,\" and \"Police Story.\"\nHis career again took off in the 1980s with \"Dune,\" \"Paris, Texas,\" \"To Live and Die in L.A.,\" \"Blue Velvet,\" \"Gardens of Stone,\" \"Tucker: The Man and His Dream\" (as Howard Hughes), \"Air Force One,\" and \"The Manchurian Candidate.\" TV roles included \"Chicago Hope,\" \"JAG,\" and \"Battlestar Galactica.\" He reteamed with Bakula as a guest star on \"Star Trek: Enterprise\" and \"NCIS: New Orleans.\"\nIn 2004 Stockwell told Las Vegas Weekly that he attributed his long career to \"good fortune and fate. It amazes me that I'm still alive and that I'm still working.\"\nHe was featured on what is considered the first standup comedy album, \"At Sunset\" (1955), and it was, he said, \"illegal. … Nobody told us they were recording it. They just recorded it and put it out.\" That brazen act mirrored the boldness that characterized the humor of satirist Mort Sahl (May 11, 1927-October 26, 2021), whose comedy provided a commentary on politicians and current events that was in sync with an anti-establishment audience during the 1950s and '60s.\nSahl did not tell mother-in-law jokes. Instead, he mocked presidents. Reading from a newspaper, Sahl would annotate news stories with cutting comments, often ending his routines by asking: \"Is there any group I haven't offended yet?\"\nSahl gained fame in 1953 at San Francisco's hungry i, a nexus for beatniks and college kids, and soon appeared at nightclubs across the country, and on television as the guest of Steve Allen and Jack Paar. But while he inspired generations of comedians with his pointed observations about the day's events, he did not consider himself a comedian. \"I never said I was one,\" he once noted. \"I just sort of tell the truth, and everybody breaks up along the way.\"\nBorn in Montreal, Sahl, whose family moved to the U.S., served in the Air Force, and earned money writing jokes for comedians. He would take to the stage himself when he realized his clients were \"too dumb\" to get the humor.\nThe assassination of JFK in 1963 devastated Sahl (he'd even written jokes for the president, as he would for Presidents Reagan and Bush), and his popularity declined when he began using his monologues to read from, and critique, the Warren Commission Report.\nThe loss of his only child, Morton Jr., who died at age 19, led Sahl further into a moribund period, though he continued working the college circuit and small clubs.\nIn 2004 Sahl told The AV Club that, for comedians, having a specific viewpoint is \"everything, because you filter the events through it. Otherwise, their stuff is trivial. … After your heart is broken, then you can do the material. When people write comedy from neutrality, it just gets kind of silly.\"\nGen. Colin Powell (April 5, 1937-October 18, 2021) often shared his personal story as that of the only child of Jamaican immigrants, whose not-very-promising start in the South Bronx took a turn when he discovered the ROTC at City College. When he put on his first uniform, he wrote (in his 1995 autobiography \"My American Journey\"), \"I liked what I saw.\"\nPowell spent 35 years in the Army, rising to the rank of four-star general. He was one of more than 16,000 military advisers sent to South Vietnam by President John F. Kennedy, receiving a Medal of Valor for going back into a burning helicopter to rescue others. He would serve as a military assistant to Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger, commander of the Army's 5th Corps in Germany, and national security assistant to President Ronald Reagan, before becoming the first Black chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, overseeing the 1991 U.S. invasion of Kuwait led by President George H.W. Bush.\nHe later joined the administration of President George W. Bush as Secretary of State, the nation's first Black head diplomat. His tenure at the State Department was largely defined by the aftermath of the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks. He was the first American official to publicly blame Osama bin Laden's al Qaeda network, and he flew to Pakistan to demand that then-President Pervez Musharraf cooperate with the U.S. in going after the Afghanistan-based terror group. (It was in Pakistan where bin Laden would be killed nearly 10 years later.)\nPowell's reputation, however, was marred by his 2003 address to the United Nations Security Council in which he cited faulty intelligence information to claim that Iragi President Saddam Hussein secretly possessed, or was developing, weapons of mass destruction, and posed a major regional and global threat. The following month, President Bush ordered the invasion. Though the Iraqi leader was deposed, the weapons never materialized.\nDespite the power vacuum created by the invasion, and years of insurgent fighting that killed countless Iraqi civilians, Powell maintained in a 2012 Associated Press interview that, on balance, the U.S. succeeded in Iraq. \"I think we had a lot of successes,\" he said. \"Iraq's terrible dictator is gone.\"\nThough he worked in Republican administrations, Powell was courted by both Republicans and Democrats to run for president, a position he declined. (\"I have no political fire burning in my belly,\" he told \"60 Minutes\" correspondent Ed Bradley in 1992.) Powell publicly endorsed Democrats in the past four presidential elections, including Sen. Barack Obama (calling him \"a transformational figure\" who also represented a generational change), and became a vocal critic of President Donald Trump, whom he called \"a national disgrace.\"\nPowell told Bradley that the U.S. had become more inclusive in the time since he was a young Army recruit stationed at Fort Benning in Georgia, and that the spirit of cooperation with which the Gulf War was fought and won needed to be brought back to America: \"That's very difficult, but I think it's a matter of being a lot more tolerant of each other, and recognizing that whatever our racial differences or ethnic differences might be, or even economic differences, we're all Americans, and we all have to live in this home that we call America.\"\nThe tunes of Oscar-winning British songwriter Leslie Bricusse (January 29, 1931-October 19, 2021) stretched from the factory of Willy Wonka to the spy world of James Bond, and sparked hit records by Sammy Davis Jr., Shirley Bassey, and Anthony Newley.\nA Cambridge University graduate who was president of the Footlights performance club, he began writing music for the West End and the movies. Working either solo or in collaboration, Bricusse wrote words, music or both, including lyrics for the Bond theme songs \"Goldfinger\" and \"You Only Live Twice\" (with music by John Barry), and the Academy Award-nominated score for \"Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory\"; its songs, co-written with Anthony Newley, include \"Pure Imagination\" and \"The Candy Man.\"\nBricusse and Newley also wrote the musicals \"Stop the World - I Want to Get Off\" (which featured the Grammy-winning song \"What Kind of Fool Am I?\") and \"The Roar of the Greasepaint - the Smell of the Crowd.\"\nBricusse won an Academy Award for his song \"Talk to the Animals,\" from the 1968 musical \"Doctor Doolittle.\" He won a second Oscar for his work, with Henry Mancini, on \"Victor/Victoria.\" Other credits include \"Two for the Road,\" \"In Like Flint,\" \"Goodbye, Mr. Chips,\" \"Scrooge,\" \"Revenge of the Pink Panther,\" \"Santa Claus: The Movie,\" \"Sherlock Holmes: The Musical,\" \"Cyrano,\" \"Jekyl & Hyde,\" and \"Sammy.\" He collaborated with John Williams on songs for \"A Guide for the Married Man,\" \"Superman,\" \"Home Alone,\" \"Hook,\" and \"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone.\"\nIn a 2021 NPR interview, Bricusse ruminated on the lasting appear of his \"Willy Wonka\" song, \"Pure Imagination\": \"It's a good thought for people, especially young people, to carry with them through life. You'll be free if you truly wish to be, at the end is, to me, the most important line in the film. It's a reflective thought on how to make a life work.\"\nIn addition to being a jazz musician who performed with the likes of Dizzie Gillespie, Tom Morey (August 15, 1935-October 14, 2021) was an engineer who brought several innovations to the world of surfing, including the invention of the Boogie Board.\nBorn in Detroit, Morey moved to Laguna Beach, Calif., as a kid, becoming an avid bodysurfer. He developed the Concave Nose Pocket and the Wing-tipped Nose, and became a sponsored pro surfer. Employed at Douglas Aircraft (and, later, Boeing), he turned his experience with composite materials into surfboards with his company, Tom Morey Skeg Works. He created the first TRAF polypropylene fin, as well as a three-piece surfboard that folded into a suitcase.\nIn Hawaii, Morey created several air-lubricated surfboards. In 1974 he formed Morey Boogie, and soon began production of Boogie Boards – a large piece of polyethylene foam about half the length and a fraction of the weight of a surfboard, with a rounded nose (he'd used a hot iron to mold its shape), and internal twin fiberglass rods for support. Boogie Boards (or \"bodyboards,\" as sold by competing manufacturers) proved an immensely popular water toy. Morey then founded another company, Starwaves, and sold soft-shell surfboards like the Sizzle, manufactured under his newly-adopted name, simply \"Y.\"\nIn a 2020 interview with Surfer Today, looking back on his life, Morey said, \"I realize how complex and vast life is. My role is so tiny. … And yet, my dreams always know where to reach me. I did okay, so dreams are also good. I must be doing some things right. … Although I perhaps could have done more, I helped revolutionize life on this planet – gave billions of hours of pleasure to millions of people.\"\nComposer and musician Paddy Moloney (August 1, 1938-October 12, 2021) was a founding member and leader of the Irish musical group The Chieftains. At a young age he was playing a plastic tin whistle, and at eight he was being instructed in the uilleann pipes by Leo Rowsome.\nAfter performing with different mixes of musicians, Moloney hit upon what would become the lineup of The Chieftains in 1962, recording their first of 44 albums. Over the next half-century the group would broaden the appeal of traditional Irish music around the world, while receiving six Grammy Awards, with 21 nominations.\nMoloney also recorded or arranged music for such films as \"Barry Lyndon,\" \"The Grey Fox,\" \"Gangs of New York,\" \"Far and Away,\" and \"Two If By Sea.\"\nIn addition to recording, Moloney managed Claddagh Records for several years in the late 1960s and early '70s, building a catalogue of folk, traditional, classical, and spoken word recordings.\nIn 2012 Moloney collaborated with folk, rock and country artists (including Bon Iver, the Decembrists, Low Anthem, the Civil Wars, Punch Brothers, and Imelda May) on an album, \"Voice of Ages,\" which celebrated The Chieftains' impact on other genres. He described to The New York Times their shared aesthetic: \"What's happening here with these young groups is they're coming back to the melody, back to the real stuff, the roots and the folk feeling of them all. I can hear any of them singing folk songs.\"\nBorn to activist parents, Sister Megan Rice (January 31, 1930-October 10, 2021) became a nun and Catholic peace activist who spent two years in federal prison while in her 80s after breaking into a government security complex to protest nuclear weapons.\nAfter joining the Society of the Holy Child of Jesus to become a nun, and later earning degrees from Villanova and Boston University, she taught at elementary schools in New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Massachusetts for more than a decade before being assigned to work in Nigeria. Rice spent 23 years in West Africa, where she learned about the plowshares movement, a reference to a Biblical passage (\"They will beat their swords into ploughshares\") about the end of war. Her activism was also heavily influenced by her uncle, who spent four months in Nagasaki, Japan, after it and Hiroshima had been leveled by atomic bombs.\nWhen she returned to the U.S., Rice began her involvement in anti-nuclear activism. Court records show she already had been convicted four times for protest activities when she (then age 82) and two fellow Catholic peace activists, Michael Walli and Greg Boertje-Obed, broke into the Y-12 National Security Complex in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, in July 2012. The trio cut through several fences and spent two hours outside a bunker storing much of the nation's bomb-grade uranium, where they hung banners, prayed, hammered on the outside of the bunker, and spray-painted peace slogans. They were arrested and charged with felony sabotage.\nFederal prosecutors described Rice and her codefendants as \"recidivists and habitual offenders\" who would break the law again \"as soon as they are physically capable of doing so,\" according to court records. Rice's attorneys sought leniency from U.S. District Judge Amul Thapar, arguing the nun's devotion to Christian nonviolence posed little threat to the public. But the judge was unmoved, telling the defendants their moral beliefs were \"not a get out of jail free card.\" Rice was sentenced to three years in prison, and Walli and Oertje-Obed each received more than five years.\nThe 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals threw out the sabotage charge, and the three were freed in May 2015 after serving two years. They were later resentenced to time already served on a lesser charge of injuring government property.\nWhile testifying during her jury trial, Rice defended her decision to break into the Oak Ridge uranium facility as an attempt to stop \"manufacturing that … can only cause death,\" according to a trial transcript. \"I had to do it,\" she said of her decision to break the law. \"My guilt is that I waited 70 years to be able to speak what I knew in my conscience.\"\nHe was a man of letters, music, theater and film, earning the sobriquet \"Godfather of Black Cinema\" for helping to usher in a wave of \"blaxploitation\" movies in the 1970s that influenced generations of filmmakers. The best-known work of Melvin Van Peebles (August 21, 1932-September 22, 2021) was the 1971 movie \"Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song,\" an indie film that he wrote, produced, directed, starred in and scored. It was a violent tale of a Black street hustler on the run after killing police officers who were beating a Black revolutionary. Despite its low budget and limited distribution (it initially received an X rating), the film became a box office hit, inspiring Hollywood to chase after a lucrative but untapped Black film market.\nIn 2002 Van Peebles complained that subsequent Black films failed to address the political, instead sensationalizing crime: \"What Hollywood did – they suppressed the political message, added caricature – and blaxploitation was born. The colored intelligentsia were not too happy about it.\"\nHis road to making what became the #1 film in America was circuitous. A graduate of Ohio Wesleyan University, he joined the Air Force, then moved to Mexico and worked as a portrait painter, then moved to San Francisco where he wrote short stories and made short films while driving cable cars. The job offers he received in Hollywood didn't rise far above parking attendant, so he moved to Holland, studying astronomy and taking classes at the Dutch National Theatre. In Paris he adapted his work into French, and made a feature film: \"La Permission/The Story of a Three Day Pass\" (1967), about an affair between a French woman and a Black U.S. soldier. It won a critics' prize at the San Francisco Film Festival.\nAsked by CBS Station KPIX in 1967 about how one rises from cable car grip man to internationally recognized film director, Van Pebbles said, \"Well, you don't pay attention to what people tell you.\"\nVan Peebles was hired to direct the satire \"Watermelon Man,\" starring Godfrey Cambridge as a White bigot who wakes up one day as a Black man. The money he earned would bankroll \"Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song\" (which has recently received a 4K restoration for its 50th anniversary).\nRefusing to work in movies without control, Van Peebles wrote and produced several plays and musicals on Broadway, including the Tony-nominated \"Ain't Supposed to Die a Natural Death\" and \"Don't Play Us Cheap.\" He also co-wrote the 1977 Richard Pryor film \"Greased Lighting,\" about Wendell Scott, the first Black race car driver. He penned the screenplay for \"Panther,\" adapted from his novel and directed by his son, Mario Van Peebles. He also recorded several albums.\nHis career path took yet another turn in the 1980s, when Van Peebles became a Wall Street options trader and wrote a financial self-help guide titled \"Bold Money.\"\nIn 2004 Van Peebles discussed with Filmmaker Magazine how his experience with \"Sweetback\" challenged the film industry: \"I did the one thing a Black guy can't do – succeed without a master. When I finished the film, I had to hire me a White guy to pretend he was the boss to sell the damn film! …\n\"When I didn't fail, everybody got pissed off! You dig it? I've not had a real job offer since I made 'Sweetback's.' So, I just went to Broadway and did very well in the theater. But it wasn't a surprise, it wasn't a shock. My feelings weren't hurt. This is what you expect. And hallelujah, that made it possible for someone else.\"\nActor Willie Garson (February 20, 1964-September 21, 2021) played talent agent Stanford Blatch, the devoted and stylish best male friend of Sarah Jessica Parker's Carrie Bradshaw, on the TV series \"Sex and the City\" and in its movie sequels. [He was filming an upcoming series revival for HBO Max called \"And Just Like That.\"]\nA native of Highland Park, N.J., Garson began studying acting at age 13 at the Actors Institute in New York. Among his hundreds of TV and film appearances were roles in \"White Collar\" (as the con man Mozzie), \"Newhart,\" \"Mr. Belvedere,\" \"Groundhog Day,\" \"The X-Files,\" \"Twin Peaks,\" \"Melrose Place,\" \"Ally McBeal,\" \"Star Trek: Voyager,\" \"NYPD Blue,\" \"CSI: Miami,\" \"Hawaii Five-0,\" \"Two and a Half Men,\" \"Whole Day Down,\" \"Magnum P.I.,\" and \"Supergirl.\" He played Lee Harvey Oswald three times, in \"Ruby,\" \"Quantum Leap,\" and \"MADtv.\"\nIn 2011 he gave advice to actors in an interview with the Daily Actor: \"I actually teach an acting workshop, and my general advice is, bring yourself to the role. No two people are doing the same role the same way and there's a reason for that. You have your reality, your physicality, your hairline, your life experiences, and that is what makes acting interesting. That's what makes people interested in actors, is them bringing what they bring to the role – not to do it like someone else do it.\"\nGeorge Holliday (June 1960-Sept. 19, 2021), a plumber, had recently purchased a Sony video camera to document a friend's marathon run when he was awakened by a police helicopter after midnight on March 3, 1991. He stepped outside his San Fernando Valley home to record the beating by several White police officers of a Black man who'd been pulled over on a traffic stop. The victim was Rodney King, who was kicked, punched, tasered and bound. Holliday recorded nine minutes of the confrontation (he'd missed the initial interaction) and turned over his videotape to a local TV station, which later shared it with CNN.\nThe footage became an international sensation, and was a critical piece of evidence in the criminal trial of the officers. When they were acquitted on charges of assault and excessive use of force in April 1992, the outcry led to rioting in the city, with hundreds of businesses looted and burned. More than 60 people died in the violence, primarily in South Los Angeles.\nHolliday told Britain's Sun newspaper that he later encountered King at a gas station, failing to recognize him at first since he'd recovered from his beating: \"He said, 'You don't know who I am, do you?' I said, 'No.' He said, 'Well, you saved my life.'\"\nHolliday, an early example of a so-called \"citizen journalist\" whose video or photos document important events, attempted to profit from his footage, but saw little after it was widely distributed. He lost a suit against the station that had shared the video, but did license the footage for a music video and also the Spike Lee film \"Malcolm X.\"\nBut the Rodney King tape's role in casting a light on police brutality would be instrumental in inspiring others to use video cameras (and later, smartphones) to record interactions with police, such as Minneapolis officer Derek Chauvin's murder of George Floyd. It also helped further calls for police body cameras to document officers' actions.\nBorn Suzanne Burce, Jane Powell (April 1, 1929-Sept. 16, 2021) started performing at age five as a singing prodigy on Portland, Oregon radio. On a trip to Los Angeles, she appeared on a network radio talent show, performing an aria from \"Carmen.\" Her 2½-octave voice won her a contract with MGM, which billed her as \"Jane Powell\" – the name of her character in her first film, \"Song of the Open Road.\"\nOn screen, Powell quickly graduated to lavish musicals, including \"A Date With Judy,\" \"Royal Wedding,\" \"Seven Brides for Seven Brothers\" and \"Hit the Deck.\" Other films included \"Young, Rich and Pretty,\" \"Small Town Girl\" and \"Three Sailors and a Girl.\"\nBut as musicals fell out of favor, Powell left MGM, and performed on stage, touring in \"The Unsinkable Molly Brown\" and \"I Do! I Do!,\" and replacing Debbie Reynolds on Broadway in \"Irene.\" Her TV credits included variety shows, a remake of \"Meet Me in St. Louis,\" and guest spots on \"Fantasy Island,\" \"The Love Boat,\" \"Murder, She Wrote,\" \"Growing Pains,\" and \"Law & Order: Special Victims Unit.\"\nIn 2000, Powell explained to the New York Observer why she abandoned her singing career for more dramatic roles: \"I can't hit the high notes, and I won't be second-rate.\"\nFor the Off-Broadway comedy \"Avow,\" Powell played a devout Catholic who was mother to a pregnant, single woman in love with a priest, and a gay son who wants to marry his lover. \"It's the first time in my life a director has said anything to me besides, 'Just be Jane Powell,'\" she said.\nRaised in Quebec City, Norm Macdonald (Oct. 17, 1959-Sept. 14, 2021) was a stand-up comedian and a writer for \"Roseanne\" when he was hired to write and perform on \"Saturday Night Live\" in 1993. He would become known for his impressions of Bob Dole, Larry King, David Letterman and Burt Reynolds, about whom he told New York Magazine in 2018, \"I always loved him. Burt had the timing of a stand-up. When I was doing my impression, I was like, 'I know why I'm getting laughs: because I'm stealing his great work.'\"\nHis deadpan style made him a perfect anchorman for \"Weekend Update.\" However, his incessant and cutting jokes about one of his favorite targets, O.J. Simpson, would cost him his job; he was fired mid-season in 1998 by NBC Entertainment executive Don Ohlmeyer, who was a friend of Simpson's. [When MacDonald announced his firing while a guest on Letterman's late-night show, Letterman thought he was putting on an Andy Kaufman-esque act.]\nAfter \"SNL\" Macdonald starred in a sitcom, \"The Norm Show\" (a.k.a. \"Norm\"), as a hockey player-turned-social worker; \"A Minute With Stan Hooper\"; \"Sports Show with Norm Macdonald\"; \"Norm Macdonald Live\"; and \"Norm Macdonald Has a Show.\" In addition to countless guest appearances on late-night shows, he also appeared on \"Sunnyside\" and \"The Middle,\" and provided voicework for \"Family Guy\" and \"The Orville.\"\nOf his standup philosophy, Macdonald told The New York Times in 2018 that \"Making people laugh is a gift. Preaching to them is not a gift. There are people who can do that better – preachers.\"\nImpresario George Wein (Oct. 3, 1925-Sept. 13, 2021) helped found the Newport Jazz and Folk Festivals, creating the template for such music events as Woodstock and Lollapalooza.\nA former jazz club owner and aspiring pianist, who also started the Storyville record label in Boston, Wein began the Newport Jazz Festival in 1954 with a stellar lineup (which included Billie Holiday, Dizzy Gillespie, Ella Fitzgerald and Lester Young) and a drenching downpour of rain. But he was back the following year with Louis Armstrong, and with Duke Ellington and his band in 1956.\nThat first gathering was inspired by a socialite's complaint that summers in Newport, R.I., were \"boring.\" \"What was a festival to me?\" Wein later said. \"I had no rulebook to go by. I knew it had to be something unique, that no jazz fan had ever been exposed to.\" So, he improvised, combining the energy of a Harlem jazz club with the ambience of a classical concert at Tanglewood.\nFor more than 50 years Wein led the festival, which showcased such artists as Miles Davis, Thelonious Monk, Charles Mingus, Wynton Marsalis, Frank Sinatra, Count Basie, Art Blakey, John Coltrane, B.B. King, Dave Brubeck, Sly and the Family Stone, Mahalia Jackson, Ike and Tina Turner, Ray Charles and Aretha Franklin. The success of Newport would inspire other jazz festivals across the U.S. and in Europe. In 1959, Wein helped found a companion folk festival, at which Pete Seeger, Joan Baez and the Kingston Trio performed. During the 1963 festival, Bob Dylan turned up with an electric band, and without an acoustic instrument – a landmark music event.\nIn 2005, Wein sold his company, Festival Productions Inc., and took on a more limited role at Newport, later establishing a nonprofit foundation to oversee the events. \"I want the festivals to go on forever,\" Wein told The Associated Press. \"With me it's not a matter of business. This is my life.\"\nHe was the Humphrey Bogart of France – a magnetic and virile personality whose unconventional movie-star looks nonetheless dominated international screens over the course of five decades. Actor Jean-Paul Belmondo (April 9, 1933-September 6, 2021) appeared in more than 80 films, by such filmmakers as Jean-Luc Godard, François Truffaut, Jean-Pierre Melville, Louis Malle, Claude Lelouch and Agnès Varda, his best-known appearance being the New Wave hit \"Breathless\" (1960), opposite Jean Seberg.\nThe son of a famed sculptor and a painter, Belmondo in his youth trained as a boxer, but when he switched to acting lessons, one of his teachers mocked the idea that, with his looks, he could ever be a romantic leading man. After work in regional theaters, he was spotted by Godard, who cast him in a short film, \"Charlotte and Her Boyfriend.\" He played a gangster in Claude Sautet's \"Classe tous risques (Consider All Risks),\" before Godard picked him to star in \"Breathless,\" an international breakthrough for both director and star.\nThe actor who could never be taken seriously as a leading man would, in the next decade, star opposite Anna Karina, Jeanne Moreau, Catherine Deneuve, Sophia Loren, Claudia Cardinale, Gina Lollobrigida, Ursula Andress and Genevieve Bujold. His films – comedies, dramas and actioners – showcased his athleticism and projected an alienation that benefited his portrayals of rogue lovers, outcasts, criminals and antiheroes.\nIn the 1980s Belmondo returned to the stage, in a 1987 Paris production of Jean-Paul Sartre's \"Kean,\" and won a Cesar Award (the French Oscar) for \"Itinerary of a Spoiled Child.\" His final film role, several years after suffering a stroke, was in 2008's \"A Man and His Dog,\" a role he took on the condition that he be allowed to show his infirmity. \"It's me, without any special effects,\" he told The New York Times in 2009. \"I hope to be an example for all. I hope.\"\nBroadcast veteran Willard Scott (March 7, 1934-September 4, 2021) started his 65-year-long career at NBC as a page, the springboard for many television   résumés, and in Scott's case that included serving for more than three decades as the weatherman for the network's morning show, \"Today.\" But not many pages could say they'd also dressed up as Bozo the Clown or Ronald McDonald – or as Brazilian singer Carmen Miranda, whom Scott once impersonated as a stunt to raise a $1,000 donation for the USO.\nHis stint as Bozo came after being picked among his station's announcers to attend clown school in California. \"I was either going to be a politician when I graduated, or Bozo,\" he said in 1997. \"And I chose the straight life; I chose Bozo.\"\nJoining \"Today\" in 1980, Scott charmed the audience with his self-deprecating humor and cheerful personality, which extended to congratulating viewers who were celebrating their 100th birthdays – 40,000 centenarians, by one count, during his 35 years on the broadcast.\nA fan favorite of young and old, Scott was covering the parade at President George H.W. Bush's inauguration, when he was greeted by first lady Barbara Bush, who ran over to Scott on the sidelines and planted a big kiss on his lips. \"I got a seven-year contract out of that kiss!\" Scott said in a 2015 \"Today\" retrospective.\nNFL wide receiver David Patten (August 19, 1974-September 2, 2021) caught Tom Brady's first postseason touchdown pass – a leaping 8-yard reception against the St. Louis Rams – to help the New England Patriots win their first Super Bowl title in 2002. He helped the Patriots to two more championships, in 2004 and 2005.\nDuring his 12 seasons in the NFL (he also played for the New Orleans Saints, Washington Redskins, Cleveland Browns, and New York Giants), Patten appeared in 147 games, catching 324 passes for 4,715 yards and 24 touchdowns.\nAfter retiring from professional football, Patten returned to Western Carolina University, his alma mater, to join the coaching staff.\nIn a 2013 interview with the Western Carolina Journal, Patten recounted the rough, early years of his career (being cut loose from the Canadian Football League, ignored during the 1996 NFL draft, and, after a year in the Arena Football League, being picked up, then dropped by the Giants), and how he finally found his footing with Brady and the Patriots.\n\"My dream had come true,\" Patten said. \"Everybody dreams of catching a touchdown pass in a Super Bowl, and I achieved that. It was as if all of the hard work, all of the setbacks had made it that much sweeter. It made it all worth it.\"\nGreek composer Mikis Theodorakis (July 29, 1925-September 2, 2021) was renowned for creating rousing music while leading a life of rousing political defiance, which included several years as a member of the Greek parliament.\nBorn on the eastern Aegean island of Chios, Theodorakis began writing music and poetry in his teens, just as Greece entered World War II. His involvement in left-wing resistance groups led to his arrests by Italian and German occupiers, and persecution after the war by the Greek regime. He was jailed, and as a result of severe beatings and torture, including mock executions, Theodorakis suffered broken limbs, respiratory problems and other injuries that plagued his health for the rest of his life. Despite the hardships, he graduated from Athens Music School and continued his studies in Paris.\nA prolific career as a composer included more than 1,000 songs, as well as symphonies and chamber music, operas, and music for films and ballet. A music series based on poems written by Nazi concentration camp survivor Iakovos Kambanellis, \"The Ballad of Mauthausen,\" described the horrors of camp life and the Holocaust.\nBut it was the Oscar-winning film adaptation of Nikos Kazantzakis' \"Zorba the Greek,\" in 1964, and   Theodorakis' slow-to-frenetic folk music, that made him a household name.\nPLAY EXCERPT: \"Zorba's Dance,\" from \"Zorba the Greek\"\nAs Theodorakis' fame grew, political turmoil in Greece led to his compositions being banned by the military dictatorship then in power. Placed in a concentration camp, Theodorakis was ultimately freed following an international outcry, and went into exile in Paris, from which he maintained his activism, his music becoming a soundtrack of resistance.\nIn a 2017 interview with the Greek newspaper Proto Thema, Theodorakis talked about facing his torturer in prison, who'd asked him if he knew that his life was worth nothing. Theodorakis responded by humming the theme from \"Zorba the Greek.\" When his torturer asked what it was, Theodorakis replied, \"'It's \"Zorba\"'s music. If I die, every time this is played you will be haunted by \"Zorba.\" Both you and your superiors.' … And that's how I was saved, I think. 'Zorba' must have saved me. Otherwise, I would have been done for.\"\nHe also contributed the scores for 1969's \"Z\" (the Oscar-winner for Best Foreign Language Film), and the 1973 Al Pacino police drama \"Serpico.\"\nFor most of the 1980s he was a member of parliament for the Greek Communist Party, but later served in the cabinet of the conservative government. His defenders saw him as a unifier, trying to heal the nation's longstanding political divisions.\nGruff and curmudgeonly on the outside, with a gooey center: That was how the character of Lou Grant, the boss of Mary Richards on \"The Mary Tyler Moore Show,\" cemented actor Ed Asner (November 15, 1929-August 29, 2021) in the popular imagination.\nA high school football player who had studied journalism at the University of Chicago, Asner switched to acting, making his debut as Thomas Becket in a campus production of T.S. Eliot's \"Murder in the Cathedral.\" After a stint in the Army Signal Corps, working at an auto plant and a steel mill, and driving a cab, he appeared at Chicago's Playwrights Theatre Club and the improv troupe Second City, before a trip to Hollywood to appear in the series \"Naked City.\"\nAsner began amassing more than 400 film and TV appearances, from the John Wayne western \"El Dorado,\" to the Elvis Presley vehicles \"Kid Galahad\" and \"Change of Habit.\" His other credits included \"Route 66,\" \"The Untouchables,\" \"The Alfred Hitchcock Hour,\" \"The Virginian,\" \"Dr. Kildare,\" \"The Outer Limits,\" \"The Defenders,\" \"Slattery's People,\" \"The Satan Bug,\" \"The Rat Patrol,\" \"Gunsmoke,\" \"The Fugitive,\" \"The Wild Wild West,\" \"Mission Impossible,\" \"The FBI,\" \"Ironside,\" and \"They Call Me Mister Tibbs.\"\nFor seven seasons beginning in 1970, Asner portrayed Mary Tyler Moore's boss at the WJM-TV newsroom. His introduction to us, and to prospective employee Mary Richards, was hilariously pithy:\nGrant: \"You know what? You've got spunk.\" Richards: \"Oh! Well ...\" Grant: \"I HATE spunk!\"\n\"That audience was like an animal,\" Asner recalled for \"Sunday Morning\" in 2012. \"Three hundred people, and they went Aaahhhhhhh!!! I felt like I could command them to walk off a cliff!\"\nThen, when Moore's comedy went off the air, he continued in a spin-off series, \"Lou Grant,\" an hour-long drama in which Grant returned to newspaper work as the city editor of a Los Angeles daily. Asner starred in that series for five years, and between the two shows won five Emmys for playing the same character. (He received two more Emmys for the miniseries \"Rich Man, Poor Man\" and \"Roots.\")\nAsner served as president of the Screen Actors Guild at the time he starred in \"Lou Grant.\" When he spoke out against U.S. involvement in El Salvador, the furor led to boycotts by advertisers and the series being cancelled. (CBS insisted that declining ratings were the reason.)\nOther roles included \"Fort Apache, the Bronx,\" \"Daniel,\" \"The Bronx Zoo,\" \"JFK,\" \"Mad About You,\" \"ER,\" \"Elf,\" \"The Practice,\" \"Center of the Universe,\" \"The Good Wife,\" \"Forgive Me,\" \"Dead to Me,\" and \"Cobra Kai.\" Among his numerous vocal performances, the most notable was as the centerpiece of the Oscar-winning Pixar animated film, \"Up,\" as an elderly man whose house takes flight courtesy of balloons.\nAsner continued to be politically active, publishing \"The Grouchy Historian: An Old-Time Lefty Defends Our Constitution Against Right-Wing Hypocrites and Nutjobs.\"\nIn 2012 \"Sunday Morning\" correspondent Rita Braver asked the then-82-year-old about his starring role in the Broadway play, \"Grace\": \"I just think a lot of people as successful as you are, they wouldn't put themselves through this, out there every night.\"\n\"Well, then, they don't love acting,\" Asner replied. \"I love acting.\"\nFrom childhood Charlie Watts (June 2, 1941-August 24, 2021) was passionate about music, particularly jazz. He taught himself the drums, which he played as a side gig to his day job at an advertising agency. After performing with Mick Jagger in Alexis Korner's Blues Incorporated, he joined the Rolling Stones, in 1963, and would be their drummer until his death.\nWatts was ranked among the greatest of rock drummers, as the Stones rose to international superstardom. Self-effacing, Watts largely avoided the drugs and personal dramas that affected other band members, and was a steadying influence for a group known as much for its longevity as for its musical supremacy.\nWatt's remarkable percussion contributed to the success of such classics as \"(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction,\" \"Get Off of My Cloud,\" \"Gimme Shelter,\" \"19th Nervous Breakdown,\" \"Miss Amanda Jones,\" \"Paint It, Black,\" \"Beast of Burden,\" \"Honky Tonk Women,\" \"Moonlight Mile,\" and \"Tumbling Dice.\"\nAs a jazz aficionado, Watts recorded several albums, beginning in 1986 with \"Live at Fulham Town Hall.\" He toured and recorded with his own group, the Charlie Watts Quintet, and the expanded Charlie Watts and the Tentet.\nIn 1994 Watts told \"60 Minutes\" correspondent Ed Bradley, \"I always consider myself a drummer, you know? That's to keep the time and help everyone else do what they're doing. I don't really like solo-type things. I mean, I do sort of solo records, but they're sort of jazz-type things, and I do that because I don't do that with the Rolling Stones.\"\nSinger-songwriter Micki Grant (June 30, 1929-August 22, 2021) earned two of her three Tony Award nominations for the 1973 musical \"Don't Bother Me, I Can't Cope,\" a revue in which rock, jazz, soul, gospel and spoken-word told of the Black urban experience in the early '70s.\n\"There was a lot of angry theater out there at the time, especially in the Black community,\" Grant told The New York Times in 2018. \"I wanted to come at it with a soft fist. I wanted to open eyes but not turn eyes away.\"\nShe also wrote the music for the 1978 adaptation of Studs Terkel's \"Working.\" Grant's other theatre credits included \"Your Arms Too Short to Box With God,\" \"Eubie!,\" \"Alice,\" and \"The Prodigal Sister.\"\nHer song \"Pink Shoelaces,\" a hit for Dodie Stephens in 1959, would appear in such TV shows as \"The Monkees\" and \"The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel.\"\nAs an actress, Grant appeared on stage in \"The Blacks,\" \"The Cradle Will Rock,\" \"Having Our Say,\" and \"Brecht on Brecht,\" and on TV in the soaps \"Another World,\" \"Guiding Light,\" \"Somerset,\" \"The Edge of Night,\" and \"All My Children.\"\nDon Everly (February 1, 1937-August 21, 2021) and his brother, Phil, grew up in a musical family, the sons of Ike and Margaret Everly, who were folk and country music singers. In the 1940s, Don and his brother would join their parents on their family's radio show in Shenandoah, Iowa, singing as The Everly Family. In the 1950s, after moving to Nashville, Don and Phil signed with Cadence Records, and began a long streak of hits – poignant pop and country-rock songs with yearning harmonies that spoke to their rural roots.\nThe Everly Brothers had 19 Top 40 hits, including \"Bye Bye Love,\" \"Let It Be Me,\" \"All I Have to Do Is Dream,\" \"Wake Up Little Susie,\" \"Cathy's Clown,\" \"When Will I Be Loved,\" and \"Crying in the Rain.\"\nIn 1973 they broke up, dramatically so, on stage at Knott's Berry Farm in California. Phil threw down his guitar down and walked off, as Don told the crowd, \"The Everly Brothers died 10 years ago.\"\nDon recorded three solo albums in the '70s, but the duo reunited in 1983, \"sealing it with a hug,\" Phil said. They continued with successful concert tours in the U.S. and Europe, and had late-career success with \"On the Wings of a Nightingale\" (written by Paul McCartney) and \"Born Yesterday.\" They were inducted into the Rock 'n' Roll Hall of Fame in 1986.\nDon Everly said in a 1986 Associated Press interview that he and his brother were successful because \"we never followed trends. We did what we liked and followed our instincts. Rock 'n' roll did survive, and we were right about that. Country did survive, and we were right about that. You can mix the two, but people said we couldn't.\"\nCountry music singer-songwriter and author Tom T. Hall (May 25, 1936-August 20, 2021) was nicknamed \"The Storyteller,\" for songs that spoke of life's joys, slights, and blue-collar travails.\nBorn in Kentucky, Hall wrote his first song by age nine. He would become one of Nashville's biggest songwriters, composing hundreds of songs for himself or others, including Loretta Lynn, Johnny Cash, George Jones and Waylon Jennings. A dozen of them became No. 1 hits. Among his biggest were \"Harper Valley PTA,\" \"I Love,\" \"Country Is,\" \"I Care,\" \"I Like Beer,\" \"Faster Horses (The Cowboy and The Poet),\" and \"(Old Dogs, Children and) Watermelon Wine.\"\nHe recorded more than two dozen albums. A member of the Grand Ole Opry, Hall hosted the syndicated TV show \"Pop! Goes the Country.\" He was inducted into both the Country Music Hall of Fame and the Songwriters Hall of Fame.\nHall also penned several books – songwriting guides, short stories, and novels. And while his songs sold millions of recording, he won his Grammy Award for writing liner notes.\nArtist Chuck Close (July 5, 1940-August 19, 2021) was an early adherent of photo-realism, who gained international acclaim in 1968 with a huge, nine-foot-tall black-and-white self-portrait. He would spend the next 50 years re-defining just what a portrait was – breaking the human face down into pixelated squares, as he explained to \"Sunday Morning\" in 2007: \"It's a little bit like an architect picking up a brick. You stack up the bricks one way, you get a cathedral. You stack up the bricks another way and you get a gas station.\"\nHe began his portraits with a photograph, which he divided into squares: \"Every square here will become four squares in the painting. There is no drawing on the canvas other than the grid. I never draw a nose. I never draw a lip.\"\nIn 1988 he suffered a serious spinal injury which left him partially paralyzed, but, fortunately still able to paint. \"Thankfully, if I'm only going to be able to still do something that I used to do, I'm pretty lucky that it turned out to be painting,\" he said.\nIn terms of the content of his artwork, Close said, \"What's changed is perhaps a slightly brighter palate, a more celebratory nature to the work. Because I was just so happy to be able to get back to work, and to find a way to work again.\"\nIn the original \"Star Trek\" series, \"redshirts\" referred to the security personnel and other, often nameless Enterprise crewmembers who seemingly always turn up dead from an alien encounter. (You do not want to wear a red uniform when going boldly where no one has gone before!) But Eddie Paskey (August 20, 1939-August 17, 2021) survived the redshirt jinx. With barely any acting experience, Paskey was hired to portray Lt. Leslie on the second \"Star Trek\" pilot, and eventually appeared (as Leslie, other anonymous redshirts, a sick bay assistant, or just a stand-in) in 62 episodes of the series – more than George Takei or Walter Koenig.\nCuriously, in a season two episode, \"Obsession,\" Lt. Leslie actually DID die, thanks to a red corpuscle-eating cloud, but Paskey turned up again later in that same episode, and in 20 more, with no real explanation as to why. (It was, after all, a science fiction show.) Paskey would later claim, in a 2004 online post, that the original script had a scene of Leslie being brought back to life, but it was never filmed.\nAs the 1960s series ended its run, Paskey dropped out of acting, but he maintained a \"Star Trek\" presence with appearances at conventions, and a turn as \"Admiral Leslie\" in a fan series, \"Star Trek: New Voyages.\" Meanwhile, the term \"redshirt\" as a trope of expendables has lived on, called out in parodies, video games, and even the 2009 \"Star Trek\" feature film reboot.\nPerforming since age 12 at coffeehouses, clubs and folk festivals in her native Texas, Grammy-winning folk singer and songwriter Nanci Griffith (July 6, 1953-August 13, 2021) grew her sound from confessional folk singer to a country-folk storyteller in her 1986 album, \"The Last of the True Believers,\" with such songs as \"Love at the Five and Dime\" (in which lovers slow-dance after hours at Woolworth's), \"Lookin' for the Time (Workin' Girl),\" and \"More Than a Whisper.\" Her first major label album, \"Lone Star State of Mind\" (1987), featured \"From a Distance\" (which was later covered by Bette Midler), \"Cold Hearts/Closed Minds\" and \"Trouble in the Fields,\" in addition to the title track.\nHer songs ran the gamut from sentimental odes to love (\"Gulf Coast Highway\") and its missteps (\"If Wishes Were Changes,\" \"Outbound Plane\"), to avenues of social commentary, as in \"It's a Hard Life Wherever You Go\" (which spoke to generational attitudes of racism in America and Northern Ireland) and \"Trouble in the Fields\" (about the economic hardships facing rural communities). \"I wrote it because my family were farmers in West Texas during the Great Depression,\" Griffith told the Los Angeles Times in 1990. \"It was written basically as a show of support for my generation of farmers.\"\nHer 1993 album \"Other Voices, Other Rooms,\" on which she sang with Emmylou Harris, John Prine, Arlo Guthrie and Guy Clark, won a Grammy for Best Contemporary Folk Album.\nPhilanthropist James Hormel (January 1, 1933-August 13, 2021), the first openly-gay U.S. ambassador, was nominated by President Bill Clinton in 1997 to become ambassador to Luxembourg. His nomination was blocked for two years by conservatives in the Senate (then-Republican Majority Leader Trent Lott likened homosexuals to alcoholics, kleptomaniacs and sex addicts), but during a congressional recess Hormel was appointed via executive privilege.\n\"The process was very long and strenuous, arduous, insulting, full of misleading statements, full of lies, full of deceit, full of antagonism,\" Hormel said during a 2012 book tour for his memoir, \"Fit to Serve.\" He served from June 1999 through 2000.\nA former dean of the University of Chicago Law School, Hormel (heir to the Hormel Foods fortune) married his college sweetheart, Alice McElroy Parker, and had five children before they divorced in 1965. He later moved to San Francisco, and at age 45 came out publicly as gay.\nHormel co-founded the Human Rights Campaign and helped fund many activities geared to arts, education and human rights, including a gay and lesbian center at the San Francisco Public Library; the National AIDS Memorial Grove; the American Foundation for AIDS Research; and the American Conservatory Theater.\nIn 2014 Hormel married Michael P.N. Araque. Two years later, after the Supreme Court had made same-sex marriage legal throughout the U.S., he told the San Francisco Chronicle, \"There's still a substantial cadre that would be willing to overturn the marriage-equality ruling. Which is totally bizarre to me. There are still people who are not willing to accept that being gay is not a choice. It's not a choice. You don't choose to be tortured by society.\"\nJapanese publisher Maki Kaji (October 8, 1951-August 10, 2021) turned a numbers game into one of the world's most popular logic puzzles. In the mid-1980s, Kaji, founder of Japan's first puzzle magazine, Nikoli, popularized sudoku, a form of numbers game that first appeared in the 19th century, in which a grid of boxes must be filled with digits one through nine.\nThe game took off when it was published in newspapers overseas – and because Kaji neglected to pursue a trademark in the United States, sales of sudoku publications by others generated no royalties for him.\nIn 2007, the \"godfather of sudoku\" told The New York Times he believed that was a brilliant mistake, allowing the game to flourish: \"This openness is more in keeping with Nikoli's open culture. We're prolific because we do it for the love of games, not for the money.\"\nThe daughter of director Alfred Hitchcock, actress Pat Hitchcock (July 7, 1928-August 9, 2021) made several appearances in her father's films and TV shows, most notably in \"Strangers on a Train\" and \"Psycho\" (as a colleague of embezzling bank employee Janet Leigh). She also acted on stage in London and New York, including as the title character in \"Violet.\"\nShe mostly retired from acting to raise a family, but did make a few appearances in the '70s, including the TV films \"Ladies of the Corridor\" and \"Six Characters in Search of an Author.\" She also co-wrote, with Laurent Bouzereau, \"Alma Hitchcock: The Woman Behind the Man,\" a biography of her mother.\nBeing the only child of the Master of Suspense, Hitchcock had a unique perspective on her father's proclivities. \"My parents were ordinary people,\" she told The Guardian in 1999. \"I know a lot of people insist that my father must have had a dark imagination. Well, he did not. He was a brilliant filmmaker and he knew how to tell a story, that's all.\"\nHe was also not immune to practical jokes, as when, during the filming of \"Strangers on a Train,\" he bet his daughter (who was afraid of heights) $100 that she wouldn't dare ride a Ferris wheel, and then had the wheel turned off once she'd gotten to the top. \"The only sadism involved was that I never got the $100,\" Pat said.\nSaxophonist Dennis \"Dee Tee\" Thomas (February 9, 1951-August 7, 2021) was a founding member of the band Kool & the Gang. A flutist and percussionist as well, he also served as the emcee of the band's shows.\nThomas was one of seven friends who, as teenagers in Jersey City, N.J. in 1967, created the group's entrancing blend of jazz, soul and funk. Originally the Jazziacs, the band released their first album in 1969, featuring the singles \"Kool and the Gang\" and \"Let The Music Take Your Mind.\"\nThe group had 11 Top 10 hit singles, including \"Jungle Boogie,\" \"Celebration,\" \"Ladies' Night,\" \"Too Hot,\" \"Get Down On It,\" \"Johanna,\" \"Cherish,\" \"Fresh\" and \"Stone Love.\"\nThey would release 30 studio and live albums, selling 70 million albums worldwide. They earned three Grammy nominations, and shared the Album of the Year Award in 1978 for their contribution to the \"Saturday Night Fever\" soundtrack (\"Open Sesame\").\nComedian Trevor Moore (April 4, 1980-August 6, 2021) co-founded the sketch comedy troupe The Whitest Kids U' Know, whose unbridled TV series (which ran on Fuse and IFC from 2007-2011) was bloody, vulgar, violent, and relentlessly inventive.\nMoore and his cohorts (most of whom were graduates from New York's School of Visual Arts) began performing together at SVA and at comedy clubs before winning an award at the Aspen Comedy Festival. Their TV show, filled with blackout bits and songs (and often run uncensored), was more than willing to tackle sex, violence, religion (the Devil turns \"Hell's Kitchen\" into a five-star restaurant, ticking off God), and other taboo subjects. Even sainted President Lincoln was not immune; Abe's boorish behavior in his box at Ford's Theatre inspires an audience member (Moore) to take matters into his own hands.\nMoore performed many rap and rock numbers, include songs about Hitler, dinosaurs, religious head coverings, and old folks' homes (where he could score Oxycodone and Percodan).\nAfter \"WKUK\" ended, Moore co-created the Disney XD series, \"Walk the Prank,\" and released a musical album, \"Drunk Texts to Myself.\" On Comedy Central he starred in the series \"The Trevor Moore Show,\" and the musical special \"High in Church.\" He also wrote and co-directed the film \"Miss March.\"\nRaised in rural Virginia, the child of Christian rock singers Mickey and Becki Moore, Trevor told the Hollywood Reporter in 2015 that traveling around the country (he would sell merchandise when his parents went on tour) bolstered his comic skills: \"How I got into comedy was from that sort of being in a different city every night,\" he said. \"If the pastor of the church, or people who were throwing the festival, had kids my age, then you try to become quick friends for a day – and then you'll never see them again.\" He had his own public access comedy show at age 16, which was picked up by the Pax cable channel – and then cancelled.\nMoore told New York Magazine in 2015 that growing up without cable he was forced to be creative out of \"sheer mind-numbing boredom\" – and as an adult he would return to the topics that surrounded him as a child in rural Virginia, including religion and Civil War history. \"I grew up in an area full of Civil War battlefields. I would go out with my grandfather with metal detectors and find cannonballs, sword handles, stuff like that. History was always present.\"\nWhich might explain his 2011 film, \"The Civil War on Drugs,\" in which stoners believe the War Between the States is really about the legalization of marijuana.\nIn the summer of 1969, at a club in Houston called The Catacombs, guitarist Billy Gibbons and drummer Frank Beard were auditioning bass players, when Dusty Hill (May 19, 1949-July 27/28, 2021) strolled up. Beard recalled for \"Sunday Morning\" in 2019 that Hill \"strapped on the guitar, and I think we wound up playing one song for about three hours straight!\"\nThe hard-driving bluesy country rock band ZZ Top built its following by touring hard – 300 nights a year in the early days, often with elaborate stage shows involving Texas longhorn steers, rattlesnakes and buzzards, not to mention Hill and Gibbons' trademark beards. (Beard himself was beardless.)\nWhat blew up ZZ Top into A-List Rock and Roll Hall of Famers was when, in the 1980s, their music videos went into heavy rotation on MTV, featuring a hot rod, a trio of women, and a string of catchy tunes, including \"Gimme All Your Lovin',\" \"Sharp Dressed Man,\" \"Legs,\" and \"Sleeping Bag.\"\nOther ZZ Top hits included \"La Grange,\" \"Tush,\" \"Tube Snake Boogie,\" \"Rough Boy,\" \"Stages,\" \"Velcro Fly,\" \"Doubleback,\" \"My Head's in Mississippi,\" \"Give It Up,\" \"Pincushion,\" \"What's Up With That,\" and \"Fearless Boogie.\" Their 1983 album \"Eliminator\" is rated 10x Platinum – more than 10 million copies sold.\nAfter half a century, ZZ Top was still working hard to make it all look so easy – and Hill was not looking forward to stopping any time soon. \"I've told people, I said, 'Look, if I retired after a few months I would be at your house singing you a song or something!'\" he told correspondent Jim Axelrod. \"I have to perform somewhere!\"\nThe king of the TV informercial, inventor and salesman Ron Popeil (May 3, 1935-July 28, 2021) got his start selling his father's creation, the \"Chop-o-Matic,\" to a captive audience: lunch counter customers in a Chicago Woolworth store. But he soon expanded his audience to TV, personally demonstrating his expanding repertoire of household gadgets that people didn't realize they absolutely needed: A smokeless ashtray; the Miracle Broom mini-vacuum (\"It's so tough, it eats up nails and tacks\"); and most famously, his Popeil's Pocket Fisherman – rod, reel and tackle that could slip into your pocket, ready for any opportunity to go fishing.\n\"I have the product that solves the problem,\" he'd say, as he hawked inventions from his own company, Ronco. There was the Inside-The-Shell Egg Scrambler; the Electric Food Dehydrator; Mr. Microphone (which would transmit your dulcet tones to a nearby FM radio); the Showtime Rotisserie and BBQ; and \"hair in a can,\" a spray-on application to cover bald spots.\nHis commercials made Popeil an informercial superstar. \"Whether it's 3:00 in the morning or noontime on a Sunday afternoon, I will be there with one of my inventions,\" Popeil told \"Sunday Morning\" correspondent Bill Geist in 2000.\nCivil rights activist Robert Parris Moses (January 23, 1935-July 25, 2021) was shot at and endured beatings and jail while leading Black voter registration drives in the American South during the 1960s. As the Mississippi field director of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), he worked to dismantle segregation and was central to the 1964 \"Freedom Summer,\" in which hundreds of students went to the South to register voters.\n\"I was taught about the denial of the right to vote behind the Iron Curtain in Europe,\" Moses once said. \"I never knew that there was (the) denial of the right to vote behind a Cotton Curtain here in the United States.\"\nMoses' family had moved north during the Great Migration. Born in Harlem, he became a teacher in New York City when, in 1960, he was inspired by the sit-in movement. He traveled to the Deep South, seeking out the Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr.'s Southern Christian Leadership Conference in Atlanta. He soon turned his attention to SNCC. He tried to register Black people to vote in Mississippi's rural Amite County where he was beaten and arrested. When he tried to file charges against a White assailant, an all-White jury acquitted the man. A judge provided protection to Moses to the county line so he could leave.\nIn 1963, he and two other activists were driving in Greenwood, Miss., when someone opened fire on them. In a statement released by SNCC, Moses described how bullets whizzed around them, and how he took the wheel when one of his companions was struck. \"We all were within inches of being killed,\" he said.\nDisillusioned with White liberal reaction to the civil rights movement, Moses soon began taking part in demonstrations against the Vietnam War. He worked as a teacher in Tanzania, Africa, returned to Harvard to earn a doctorate in philosophy, and taught high school math in Cambridge, Mass. He later taught math in Jackson, Miss., while commuting back-and-forth to Massachusetts on the weekends.\nIn 1982, thanks to a MacArthur Foundation Fellowship, Moses started his \"second chapter in civil rights work\" by founding the Algebra Project, a curriculum he developed to help struggling students in disadvantaged schools succeed in math. It would grow to serve 10,000 students yearly in nearly 30 cities nationwide.\nWith regard to the Algebra Project, Moses told The New York Times in 2001, \"The legacy that's important is the organizing, the passing on.\"\nIn the 1940s, to fill vital defense plant jobs left open when many men went off to war, women stepped up, thanks in part to a U.S. government recruitment program featuring a woman in a polka-dotted bandana rolling up her sleeve: \"Rosie the Riveter.\" Some six million women joined the workforce, including Phyllis Gould (1921-July 20, 2021), a welder building warships at the Kaiser-Richmond Shipyards, near San Francisco. She not only followed her husband into the welding trade, she was earning equal pay: $0.90 an hour.\nAfter the war, she became an interior decorator, was twice-divorced, had five children and moved around, before settling in Fairfax, Calif. She was \"kind of like a hippie, you know, where the wind blows,\" her sister told The Associated Press.\nBut because women defense workers received little notice or appreciation for their contributions after the war, Gould fought tenaciously to honor them, writing letter after letter to politicians. She helped push for the creation of the Rosie the Riveter/WWII Home Front National Historical Park in Richmond, established in 2000.\n\"Something has to be done so there's something tangible after we're gone,\" she told the Marin Independent Journal in 2019. \"There were millions of us, but there's nothing that says we were there.\"\nShe and other \"Rosies\" met with President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden in 2014, pushing for the observance of National Rosie the Riveter Day. She also helped in the design of a Congressional Gold Medal, to be issued next year in honor of the women who helped win the war.\n\"I know they're busy with really important stuff, but this is important to us,\" Gould said. \"And time is running out.\"\nA Pulitzer Prize-winning photojournalist for Reuters, Danish Siddiqui (May 19, 1983-July 17, 2021) was killed as he chronicled fighting between Afghan forces and the Taliban amid the continuing withdrawal of U.S. and NATO troops.\nA native of New Delhi, and a defense correspondent for an Indian TV network, Siddiqui decided to change careers in 2010, beginning an internship with Reuters. A self-taught photographer, Siddiqui told Forbes India in 2018 that he had been frustrated that television news focused only on big stories, not smaller features from the interior of India.\nSiddiqui was part of a team that won the Pulitzer Prize for feature photography in 2018 for their coverage of Rohingya refugees fleeing Myanmar. He has captured searing images of wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong, unrest in India, and, more recently, the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\"While I enjoy covering news stories – from business to politics to sports – what I enjoy most is capturing the human face of a breaking story,'' Siddiqui wrote in a profile on Reuters' website. \"I really like covering issues that affect people as the result of different kind of conflicts.\"\nClick here to view a gallery of some of Siddiqui's remarkable images.\nEsther Bejarano (December 15, 1924-July 10, 2021), a survivor of Auschwitz, used the power of music to fight antisemitism and racism in post-war Germany.\nShe was born in French-occupied Saarlouis in 1924; her family later moved to Saarbruecken, which was returned to Germany in 1935. When the Nazis came to power, Bejarano's parents and sister Ruth were deported and killed; Bejarano had to perform forced labor before being sent to Auschwitz-Birkenau in 1943. There, she volunteered to become a member of the girls' orchestra, playing the accordion every time trains full of Jews from across Europe arrived.\n\"We played with tears in our eyes,\" she recalled in a 2010 interview with The Associated Press. \"The new arrivals came in waving and applauding us, but we knew they would be taken directly to the gas chambers.\"\nBejarano would say later that music helped keep her alive in the notorious German Nazi death camp in occupied Poland, and during the years after the Holocaust.\nIn a memoir, Bejarano recalled her rescue by U.S. troops, who gave her an accordion, which she played the day American soldiers and concentration camp survivors danced around a burning portrait of Adolf Hitler to celebrate the Allied victory over the Nazis.\nBejarano emigrated to Israel after the war and married Nissim Bejarano. The couple had two children before returning to Germany in 1960. After once again encountering open antisemitism, Bejarano decided to become politically active, co-founding the Auschwitz Committee in 1986 to give survivors a platform for their stories.\nShe teamed up with her children to play Yiddish melodies and Jewish resistance songs in a Hamburg-based band they named Coincidence, and also with hip-hop group Microphone Mafia to spread an anti-racism message to German youth.\n\"We all love music and share a common goal: We're fighting against racism and discrimination,\" she told the AP of her collaborations across cultures and generations.\nBejarano received numerous awards, including Germany's Order of Merit, for her activism against what she called the \"old and new Nazis,\" quoting fellow Holocaust survivor Primo Levi's warning that \"it happened, therefore it can happen again.\"\nWhile addressing young people in Germany and beyond, Bejarano would say, \"You are not guilty of what happened back then. But you become guilty if you refuse to listen to what happened.\"\nDirector Robert Downey Sr. (June 24, 1936-July 7, 2021) was a maverick whose most famous film was the 1969 satire \"Putney Swope,\" in which a Black man ascends to the top of a Madison Avenue advertising agency, which he renames \"Truth and Soul, Inc.\"\nBorn in New York City as Robert Elias Jr., he later changed his surname to Downey as an underage enlistee in the Army. He was a semi-pro baseball pitcher, boxer, and aspiring playwright (in one absurdist show actors portrayed nuclear missiles). He got into experimental filmmaking at the suggestion of a friend who happened to have a 16mm camera, with a series of anti-establishment films, including \"Babo 73,\" \"Sweet Smell of Sex,\" \"Chafed Elbows\" and \"No More Excuses.\"\nThe films were rough-and-tumble almost by necessity: \"It was just fun,\" he told the Village Voice's Bilge Ebiri in 2016. \"We had no money. My wife would get a check from doing a commercial, and I'd grab it before she even saw it. Later, I'd pay it back. Nobody ever made a dime on these things. We didn't have sync sound, just a spring wind. So, you could only get eighteen seconds, and that was the end of the take, whatever it was. And we put the words in later.\"\n\"Putney Swope\" was the film that no one wanted, until a theatre owner, Dan Rugoff, picked it up and ran it on New York's Upper East Side, where the counterculture tale of an African American rewriting the rules of New York's ad world sold out. Downey recalled a screening of the film at Temple University, where he was greeted by a fellow in a jacket and tie who thanked him for getting him into advertising: \"That's when I realized I don't know anything about anything. That guy was serious. Isn't that great? He thought he was going to have that kind of fun.\"\n\"Greaser's Palace\" (1972) starred Allan Arbus as a Christ figure in the Old West. In \"Pound,\" actors play stray dogs. Among the cast: his son, Robert Downey Jr., who appeared in several of his father's films.\nDowney directed a 1973 television adaptation of David Rabe's Tony-winning play \"Sticks and Bones,\" about a blinded Vietnam veteran, produced by Joseph Papp, which CBS postponed following complaints from affiliates. When it was later rescheduled, without commercials (advertisers weren't buying), more than 90 stations refused to air it.\nDowney also directed the Mad Magazine comedy \"Up the Academy,\" and worked as a second-unit director on Norman Lear's \"Cold Turkey.\" His final film was the 2005 documentary \"Rittenhouse Square,\" an impressionistic look at a Philadelphia park and its denizens.\nDowney also appeared as an actor, in \"To Live and Die in L.A.,\" \"Boogie Nights\" and \"Magnolia.\"\nActress Suzzanne Douglas (April 12, 1957-July 6, 2021) starred in the TV sitcom \"The Parent 'Hood\" and in such films as \"Tap,\"   opposite Gregory Hines and Sammy Davis Jr., and \"How Stella Got Her Groove Back.\"\nShe played Cissy Houston in the 2015 biopic \"Whitney.\" Other credits include \"The Inkwell,\" \"Jason's Lyric,\" \"School of Rock,\" \"Against the Law,\" \"I'll Fly Away,\" \"Promised Land,\" \"The Good Wife,\" \"Bull,\" \"Really Love,\" the 2008 TV remake of \"Sounder,\" and the miniseries \"When They See Us.\"\nOn Broadway she performed in \"The Tap Dance Kid,\" \"Into the Woods\" and \"Threepenny Opera.\" Other stage credits include \"42nd Street,\" \"Les Liaisons Dangereuses,\" \"American Son,\" \"Henry V,\" \"Women of Brewster Place,\" \"Hallelujah, Baby!\" and \"Wit.\"\nAs a singer-composer, Douglas also performed jazz and standards regularly with her band, Voba.\nHe made audiences believe that a man could fly, that a cute little boy was the Antichrist, and that William Shatner could witness a monster tearing apart a plane in mid-flight. Director Richard Donner (April 24, 1930-July 5, 2021) ushered in the modern movies' superhero genre with the 1978 blockbuster film \"Superman,\" in which Christopher Reeve vividly brought the Man of Steel to life.\nDonner also helmed the highly-successful \"Lethal Weapon\" franchise of buddy-cop films starring Mel Gibson and Danny Glover as Los Angeles detectives fighting drug traffickers, arms dealers, and underworld figures.\nDonner originally set out to become an actor, but recalled some telling advice from director Martin Ritt, who said, \"Your problem is you can't take direction.\" He recommended Donner pursue directing instead and hired him as an assistant.\nDonner built a hefty resume in television, including \"Wanted: Dead or Alive,\" \"The Rifleman,\" \"Wagon Train,\" \"Have Gun, Will Travel,\" \"Combat,\" \"Perry Mason,\" \"Gilligan's Island,\" \"The Man from U.N.C.L.E.,\" \"The Fugitive,\" \"The Wild Wild West,\" \"The Sixth Sense,\" \"Ironside,\" \"Cannon,\" \"The Streets of San Francisco\" and \"Kojak.\" He directed six episodes of Rod Serling's \"The Twilight Zone,\" including the classic \"Nightmare at 20,000 Feet.\"\nHis first feature was the 1976 horror film \"The Omen,\" in which an adorable little boy carried the mark of the devil. It won an Oscar for its score and inspired several sequels.\nAfter \"The Omen,\" Donner was offered $1 million to direct \"Superman,\" a mammoth superhero origin tale with Marlon Brando and Gene Hackman attached. A tremendous fan of the character (he mourned that his mother had thrown out all his old comic books), Donner pushed for special effects that could make audiences suspend their disbelief, as Reeve carried Margot Kidder (as Lois Lane) high above Metropolis.\nFar from the parody of TV's \"Batman,\" Donner's film took the superhero from the planet Krypton seriously. In 2016 he told KCRW, \"I wasn't going to f*** up Superman.\"\nThe mammoth production actually shook out into two movies, the second of which saw Donner fired and replaced by producers.\nDonner followed \"Superman\" with \"Inside Moves,\" the Richard Pryor comedy \"The Toy,\" the medieval romantic fantasy \"Ladyhawke,\" and the Steven Spielberg-produced kids adventure, \"The Goonies.\" Other films included the Bill Murray comedy \"Scrooged,\" \"Maverick,\" \"Conspiracy Theory\" and \"Radio Flyer.\"\nHe and his wife, Lauren Shuler Donner, founded Donner/Shuler-Donner Productions (now the Donners' Company), which produced the \"X-Men\" franchise, \"Free Willy,\" \"Dave,\" and \"Deadpool.\"\nAt a 2017 tribute, Lauren characterized her husband's work: \"If you look at Dick's movies, Dick is fun, larger than life, loud, strong, with a big mushy heart.\"\nDonner was also known for his kindness and generosity, covering college tuition for one \"Goonies\" star, Jeff Cohen, and paying for life-saving rehab for another, Corey Feldman, and also for supporting animal rescue efforts.\nFormer Democratic Senator Mike Gravel (May 13, 1930-June 26, 2021), who represented Alaska from 1969 to 1981, was an anti-war activist who led a one-man filibuster protesting the Vietnam-era draft. In 1971 he read 4,100 pages of the leaked \"Pentagon Papers\" into the Congressional Record. He was also instrumental in gaining Congressional approval for the Trans-Alaska pipeline.\nHis reelection bid in 1980 was squelched over anger from President Carter's use of the Antiquities Act to protect public lands in Alaska from development (which later led to the compromise Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act).\nGravel's upstart reputation had been cemented from his 1968 campaign against incumbent Senator Ernest Gruening. He created a half-hour campaign film, \"A Man for Alaska,\" which aired in Alaska's major markets, and was flown by bush plane to screen across the state.\nIn 2006 Gravel announced he would seek the presidency, running as a critic of the Iraq War. His campaign was most notable for its David Lynchian ads; in one, Gravel silently stared into the camera for more than a minute, before turning, throwing a large rock into a pond, and walking away.\n\"The point of the spot is not the rock but the ripples it leaves in the water,\" Gravel told MSNBC, stating that he wished to cause \"ripples in society.\"\nAfter he was excluded from Democratic Party forums (in one 2007 debate he asked then-Sen. Barack Obama, \"Tell me, Barack, who do you want to nuke?\"), he ran as a Libertarian candidate.\nHe briefly ran again for the Democratic nomination in 2020, vowing to slash military spending, after agreeing to the entreaties of two \"unbelievably precocious\" 18-years-olds whom he put in charge of his campaign. \"When I finally succumbed to their pressures, I gave them access to the Twitter and they gave me a veto power, which I've only exercised once, by warning them about rough language,\" he told CBSN's \"Red & Blue.\" \"Other than that, it's been their show.\"\nHe failed to qualify for the debates, but offered himself as a vice-presidential pick for Bernie Sanders should he win the nomination. \"Well, you never know. I'm flexible. If I do get up there, I'm good for a couple, three years,\" the then-89-year-old said.\nA longtime New Yorker staff writer and author of several books, Janet Malcolm (July 8, 1934-June 16, 2021) wrote astutely about such topics as psychoanalysis, murder and photography, usurping the traditional view of the journalist as a dispassionate observer or notetaker of facts.\nBorn in Czechoslovakia, Janet's family emigrated to the U.S. when she was five, at the time the Nazis were annexing her homeland. Having written for the University of Michigan newspaper, Janet published little beyond film criticism and poetry, until 1966, when a piece on children's books got the attention of New Yorker editor William Shawn, who gave her a column.\nMalcolm's style was witty, intellectual and provocative, corralling nonfiction issues and characters with her novelistic flair, and analyzing her subjects with a withering gaze.\nIn her highly-praised first book \"Psychoanalysis: The Impossible Profession\" (1981), Malcolm (the daughter of a psychiatrist and a lawyer) explored Freudian theory, the psychoanalyst's techniques, the inner lives of analysands on the couch, and the politics of the psychoanalytic world.\nShe wrote about her first conversation with one of her subjects: \"The analysts I had seen so far had dealt with me as they habitually deal with patients on first meeting – courteously, neutrally, noncommittally, reservedly, 'abstinently' – and had also shown a certain wariness over being in the presence of a journalist. With Aaron Green, however, things were different from the start. He subtly deferred to me, he tried to impress me. He was the patient and I was the doctor; he was the student and I was the teacher. To put it in psychoanalytic language, the transference valence of the journalist was here greater than that of the analyst.\"\n\"In the Freud Archives\" roped in the personalities of academics quarreling over the legacy of Sigmund Freud – and triggered a $7 million libel suit from one subject who claimed quotations had been fabricated. The case persisted for years (with Malcolm testifying she had misplaced her notebook). She was ultimately cleared.\nIn Malcolm's serialized New Yorker story, \"The Journalist and the Murderer\" (later published in book form), she criticized writer Joe McGinniss, who collaborated with accused murderer Jeffrey MacDonald on a book about MacDonald's case (MacDonald later sued McGinniss), opening with a deft piece of self-analysis about her own profession: \"Journalists justify their treachery in various ways according to their temperaments. The more pompous talk about freedom of speech and 'the public's right to know'; the least talented talk about Art; the seemliest murmur about earning a living.\"\nOther books included the revisionist biography \"The Silent Woman: Sylvia Plath and Ted Hughes\"; \"Reading Chekhov: A Critical Journey\"; \"Two Lives: Gertrude and Alice\" (A PEN Award winner); and \"Iphigenia in Forest Hills: Anatomy of a Murder Trial.\" Her essay collections included \"Diana & Nikon: Essays on the Aesthetic of Photography\"; \"Forty-one False Starts: Essays on Artists and Writers\" (a National Book Critics Circle nominee); and \"Nobody's Looking at You: Essays.\"\nIn a 2011 profile in the Guardian, Malcolm spoke of the \"invented I of journalism\" as a character within whom she approached her subjects: \"It's a construct. And it's not the person who you are. There's a bit of you in it. But it's a creation. Somewhere I wrote, 'The distinction between the I of the writing and the I of your life is like Superman and Clark Kent.'\"\nActor Frank Bonner (February 28, 1942-June 16, 2021) found his greatest popular recognition for a thoroughly ridiculous character: Herb Tarlek, a brash, flirtatious and not terribly successful radio station ad sales manager with a tendency to wear loud polyester plaid suits, on the sitcom \"WKRP in Cincinnati.\"\nBonner would direct several episodes of the series, which led to his career as a TV comedy director, helming episodes for more than a dozen shows, including \"Family Ties,\" \"Head of the Class,\" \"Harry and the Hendersons,\" \"The Famous Teddy Z,\" \"The Mommies,\" \"Who's the Boss,\" \"Saved by the Bell: The New Class,\" and \"City Guys.\"\nBonner's first appearance before the camera was in the horror film \"Equinox,\" which grew out of a student production. Thanks to a Satanic book, Bonner turned into a winged demon.\nHe also returned to playing Tarlek in the '90s spinoff, \"The New WKRP in Cincinnati.\" His other TV acting credits included \"The Young Lawyers,\" \"Mannix,\" \"Cannon,\" \"Man From Atlantis,\" \"Sex and the Single Parent,\" \"Scarecrow and Mrs. King,\" \"Newhart,\" \"Matt Houston,\" \"Night Court,\" \"Sidekicks,\" and \"Just the Ten of Us.\"\nLouisville native Ned Beatty (July 6, 1937-June 13, 2021) spent years performing in regional theaters, in Kentucky, Virginia, Indiana and Washington, D.C. (including in \"Uncle Vanya\" and \"Death of a Salesman\"), and in New York (in \"The Great White Hope\"), before auditioning for a role in John Boorman's \"Deliverance\" (1972). Boorman had already cast the part of Bobby Trippe, one of a quartet of men on a canoe trek through the wilds of Georgia, who is set upon and raped by backwoods villains. But he hired Beatty instead, and the film's critical and commercial success launched him into the tier of most-in-demand character actors whose presence was welcomed in both comedies and dramas for more than 40 years.\nIn \"Network,\" Beatty played the chairman of a communications giant who dresses down TV anchor Howard Beale (Peter Finch) for attacking the sale of the company to Arab interests. \"You have meddled with the primal forces of nature, Mister Beale!\" he bellows, in a performance that earned him an Oscar nomination.\nBeatty was also memorable as Gene Hackman's idiot sidekick Otis in \"Superman\"; a political campaigner in \"Nashville\"; a district attorney in \"All the President's Men\"; the father of an aspiring Notre Dame football player in \"Rudy\"; and the voice of the sinister Lots-O'-Huggin' Bear in the animated \"Toy Story 3.\"\nOther films included \"The Life and Times of Judge Roy Bean,\" \"Wise Blood,\" \"Silver Streak,\" \"Mikey and Nicky,\" \"Exorcist II: The Heretic,\" \"1941,\" \"Hopscotch,\" \"The Toy,\" \"Back to School,\" \"The Big Easy,\" \"Prelude to a Kiss,\" \"Just Cause,\" \"He Got Game,\" \"Charlie Wilson's War,\" \"Rango,\" and \"Rampart.\" He re-teamed with his \"Deliverance\" co-star Burt Reynolds in \"White Lightning,\" \"W.W. and the Dixie Dancekings,\" \"Stroker Ace,\" and \"Switching Channels.\"\nBetty's many TV appearances included \"The Execution of Private Slovik,\" \"The Marcus-Nelson Murders\" (the pilot for the series \"Kojak\"), \"MASH,\" \"Attack on Terror: The FBI vs. the Ku Klux Klan,\" \"Friendly Fire,\" \"Last Train Home,\" \"Guyana Tragedy: The Story of Jim Jones,\" \"Streets of Laredo,\" and \"Homicide: Life on the Street,\" as Detective Stanley Bolander.\nHe returned to the New York stage in 2003 as Big Daddy in \"Cat on a Hot Tin Roof,\" winning a Drama Desk Award.\nBeatty was rarely the lead in a film (his most notable starring role was \"Hear My Song,\" in which he portrayed Irish tenor Josef Locke, earning a Golden Globe nod). In a 1977 New York Times interview, Beatty explained why he preferred supporting roles: \"Stars never want to throw the audience a curve ball, but my great joy is throwing curve balls. Being a star cuts down on your effectiveness as an actor, because you become an identifiable part of a product and somewhat predictable. You have to mind your p's and q's and nurture your fans. But I like to surprise the audience, to do the unexpected.\"\nScholastic, the largest publisher of children's magazines and books, recently marked its 100th anniversary of helping children make sense of the world. Founded in 1920 by Maurice R. Robinson, a freshly-minted Dartmouth grad who began publishing a magazine for schoolchildren out of his mother's sewing room, Scholastic has been led since the 1970s by his son, Richard Robinson (March 15, 1937-June 5, 2021), only the second CEO in the company's history.\nDuring his tenure Scholastic grew to annual revenues of about $1.5 billion, producing current-events magazines and educational materials for students in 90% of American schools, without any serious competition.\nDescribing the mission of Scholastic magazines in the wake of the January 6th insurrection at the U.S. Capitol, Robinson told \"Sunday Morning\" earlier this year, \"Over the years people have turned to us in important moments like this to explain things to kids and give them a pathway to understand it, and feel better about themselves and their society because of their understanding.\"\nScholastic's book publishing empire includes the Harry Potter, \"Hunger Games,\" \"Baby-Sitters Club,\" Clifford the Big Red Dog and Captain Underpants series, as well as reading clubs and book fairs.\nScholastic books were frequently included in the American Library Association's annual \"Challenged Books\" list that spotlighted books that had been pulled or censored from library or school bookshelves, such as Alex Gino's \"George,\" about a middle-school transgender girl.\n\"We strongly believe our books and magazines need to address tough topics that are relevant, even if we get backlash or boycotted,\" Robinson told The Associated Press in 2020.\nClarence Williams III (August 21, 1939-June 4, 2021) was a Tony-nominated actor whose breakout role was as Lincoln \"Linc\" Hayes in the TV series \"The Mod Squad.\" The show ran for five years beginning in 1968, and featured Williams (pictured, center), Michael Cole and Peggy Lipton as a trio of young, hip detectives using their counterculture creds to go undercover.\nA New York native whose family included noted singers, musicians and composers, Williams got his first taste of acting as a teenager, when he won a bit part in a Harlem YMCA production of \"Dark of the Moon\" – Cicely Tyson's first stage play. After serving as a paratrooper in the 101st Airborne, Williams appeared on Broadway in \"The Long Dream,\" \"The Great Indoors,\" and \"Slow Dance on the Killing Ground\" (for which he earned a Tony nomination), and in the film \"The Cool World.\"\nWilliams followed \"Mod Squad\" with roles in, among others, \"Hill Street Blues,\" \"Purple Rain\" (playing Prince's father), \"Miami Vice,\" \"52 Pick-Up,\" \"Tough Guys Don't Dance,\" \"I'm Gonna Git You Sucka,\" \"Twin Peaks,\" \"Tales from the Crypt,\" \"Sugar Hill,\" \"Tales From the Hood,\" \"The Immortals,\" \"The Silencers,\" \"Star Trek: Deep Space Nine,\" \"The Brave,\" \"Half Baked,\" \"The Legend of 1900,\" \"The General's Daughter,\" \"Life,\" \"Reindeer Games,\" \"Law & Order,\" \"George Wallace,\" \"Everyone Hates Chris,\" \"Mystery Woman,\" \"A Day in the Life,\" \"Empire,\" and an uncredited role in \"American Gangster.\"\nIn 1979 he co-starred with Maggie Smith on Broadway in Tom Stoppard's \"Night and Day.\"\nDespite his long resume, Williams told the Orlando Sun-Sentinel in 1999 that he did not begrudge his \"Mod Squad\" fame: \"All most people know about me is the two hours they've invested in a movie theater or the time spent in front of their TV. There's so much entertainment out there right now, it's difficult to break through and become part of the national consciousness. It's nice to be recognized, and I have no problem with it at all.\"\nAttorney F. Lee Bailey (June 10, 1933-June 3, 2021) made a name for himself in the sensational case of Ohio doctor Sam Sheppard, convicted in 1954 for the murder of his wife, which he'd blamed on an intruder. (His story would inspire the TV series \"The Fugitive.\") Bailey argued for and won Sheppard's right to a retrial, which Bailey would win in 1966. (He later needled the prosecutor, who was \"not on the ball,\" for neglecting to ask prospective jurors if they watched \"The Fugitive,\" in which the accused man was innocent.)\nIn a career that lasted more than four decades, the bold and brilliant Bailey became one of the most publicly identifiable attorneys in the country, with a client list that included Capt. Ernest Medina, charged in connection with the My Lai massacre during the Vietnam War (Bailey won his court-martial case); and Patty Hearst, the kidnapped newspaper heiress who joined her kidnappers, the Symbionese Liberation Army, in robbing banks (a case he lost). Hearst later accused Bailey of bungling her defense and drinking during the trial.\nHe was a member of O.J. Simpson's defense team who argued against the former NFL star's charges of murdering his wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend, Ron Goldman, in 1995. In his cross-examination of Mark Fuhrman, Bailey painted the Los Angeles police detective as a racist who planted evidence against Simpson. Bailey told CBS Station KDKA in 2017, \"I had only one objective: to show him to be a liar about something.\"\nFuhrman denied using racial epithets, but the defense later turned up recordings of Fuhrman making racist slurs, which colored his testimony. The jury acquitted Simpson.\nBailey was charismatic, but could also be arrogant and abrasive, and was once censored for what a judge called his \"extreme egocentricity.\" He was disbarred for a year in New Jersey in 1971 for talking publicly about a case. In 1996 Bailey spent almost six weeks in federal prison, charged with contempt of court after refusing to turn over millions of dollars in stock owned by a convicted drug smuggler. The experience left him \"embittered\" – and in 2001 it earned him a disbarment in Florida (and in Massachusetts the following year). The former Marine pilot who once owned airplanes and several homes filed for bankruptcy in 2016.\nWhen KDKA asked Bailey what he wishes people would ask him during interviews, he answered, \"What do you want to see on your gravestone?\" And what would he like it to read? \"That I was a good swordsman and a very nice guy,\" he replied.\nBorn Allan See, Gavin MacLeod (February 28, 1931-May 29, 2021) took as his stage name a figure from a French film and the last name of an Ithaca College drama teacher who'd encouraged him to pursue an acting career. But in his 2013 memoir, \"This Is Your Captain Speaking,\" MacLeod wrote that losing his hair at an early age had compromised his job prospects: \"I went all over town looking for an agent, but no one was interested in representing a young man with a bald head,\" he wrote. He bought a used hairpiece, and his luck changed \"pretty quickly.\"\nBy the time he reached middle age, the toupee was no longer needed – certainly not to portray the wisecracking news writer Murray Slaughter on \"The Mary Tyler Moore Show,\" nor Capt. Merrill Stubing on the long-running series \"The Love Boat.\" He would later become an ambassador for Princess Cruise Lines.\nMacLeod's early credits included the Broadway play \"A Hatful of Rain,\" and the films \"I Want to Live!,\" \"Pork Chop Hill,\" \"Operation Petticoat,\" \"High Time,\" \"The Sword of Ali Baba,\" \"Kelly's Heroes,\" \"The Sand Pebbles,\" and \"The Party.\" His TV roles included appearances on \"Peter Gunn,\" \"The Dick Van Dyke Show,\" \"The Untouchables,\" \"Hogan's Heroes,\" and \"Hawaii Five-O,\" and the supporting role of Seaman Joseph \"Happy\" Haines on \"McHale's Navy,\" for which he dumped the hairpiece for good. \"I wore it for one episode,\" he told the Los Angeles Times in 2013, \"but it was so dry it looked like a rat. We threw it on the ground and shot it.\"\nMacLeod struggled with alcoholism until he quit, cold turkey, in 1974. He then remarried his second wife, actor-dancer Patti Steele, and became a born-again Christian. He and his wife hosted a Christian radio show, \"Back on Course: A Ministry for Marriages.\" \"If it wasn't for the Lord, I wouldn't be alive,\" MacLeod told the L.A. Times.\nKevin Clark (December 3, 1988-May 26, 2021) played drummer Freddy \"Spazzy McGee\" Jones in the 2003 movie \"School of Rock.\" It was the Highland Park, Ill.-native's only film role, which he said he'd landed at age 14 after responding to a local newspaper ad looking for adolescents who can play drums, keyboards and guitar. [Clark is pictured in the film at left, and at right with co-star Jack Black at a \"School of Rock\" 10th-anniversary reunion.]\nAfter the movie, Clark pursued music as a career, playing in the bands Dreadwolf, Jess Bess and The Intentions, and with singer-songwriter Robbie Gold.\nRepublican Senator John Warner (February 18, 1927-May 25, 2021), of Virginia, served five terms, during which his centrist streak often put him at odds with the more conservative GOP leadership.\nAs a teenager Warner volunteered for the Navy in World War II, and joined the Marines during the Korean War. He then earned a law degree and clerked at the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, before going into private practice. He later served as a federal prosecutor.\nA Navy Secretary under President Nixon, Warner helped negotiate a maritime pact with the Soviet Union under President Ford, before running for the Senate in 1978. His high-profile marriage to actress Elizabeth Taylor (he was her sixth husband) burnished his credentials in the public's eye, but the marriage did not survive his first term; they divorced in 1982 (Taylor citied her \"intense loneliness\" due to his Senate work).\nWarner served as chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, and was a supporter of President George W. Bush's declaration of war in Iraq, but he also called for the return of troops home, and held hearings into the torture of detainees at U.S.-run facilities. He angered conservatives by supporting gun laws, same-sex marriage, and Roe v. Wade, and by opposing GOP nominee Oliver North's bid to unseat Virginia's Democratic Senator Charles Robb (Warner called the Iran-Contra figure unfit for public office).\n\"I sure risked my political future, that's for sure,\" Warner said in 1994. \"But I'd rather the voters of this state remember that I stood on my principle. ... That's the price of leadership.\"\nBroadway, TV, and movie actor Samuel E. Wright (November 20, 1946-May 24, 2021) brought great humanity to his roles, but he was best known for characters that weren't human – from the grapes on the Fruit of the Loom underwear label come to life, to Sebastian the Crab in the Disney animated musical, \"The Little Mermaid.\" He repeated the role in sequels, spinoffs, and even reggae albums.\nIn 1992 he told \"CBS This Morning\" that people would stop him in airports just because of the voice: \"If they hear the voice, my voice, they say, 'That voice sounds really familiar,' or they stop and ask me, 'Weren't you on \"America's Most Wanted\" or something?'\"\nWright was featured in \"Jesus Christ Superstar,\" \"Two Gentlemen of Verona,\" and \"Over Here,\" replaced Ben Vereen in \"Pippin,\" and was nominated for two Tony Awards, for \"The Tap Dance Kid,\" and as Mufasa in \"The Lion King.\" He played Dizzy Gillespie in the Charlie Parker biopic, \"Bird.\" Other screen credits include the TV series \"Ball Four,\" \"Enos,\" and \"Law & Order.\"\nIn 1994 he cofounded the Hudson Valley Conservatory, a performing-arts school in Walden, N.Y.\nWright told the Los Angeles Times in 1991 that he tried to make every role – even an animated, singing crab – the best role he's ever done. \"It doesn't matter if it's a cartoon, Dizzy Gillespie or Othello, I'm going to play it with the same fervor – just in case anybody's watching,\" he said.\n\"The Very Hungry Caterpillar\" (1969) delighted children and parents with its tale of the metamorphosis of a green-and-red caterpillar into a multi-colored butterfly. Originally conceived by author and illustrator Eric Carle (June 25, 1929-May 23, 2021) as a story about a bookworm (\"A Week with Willi the Worm\"), the hero was changed to a caterpillar on his editor's advice. It has sold some 40 million copies and been translated into 60 languages.\nBorn in New York to German immigrant parents but raised in Germany, Carle became attracted to the expressionist and abstract art that was banned by the Nazis. He returned to the States and worked as a graphic designer for The New York Times and at an advertising agency, when his artwork attracted the attention of Bill Martin Jr., who needed an illustrator for his book, \"Brown Bear, Brown Bear, What Do You See?\"\nOver the next five decades Carle would write and/or illustrate more than 75 books, including \"Do You Want to Be My Friend?,\" \"The Grouchy Ladybug,\" \"Polar Bear, Polar Bear, What Do You Hear?\" and '\"From Head to Toe.\" One of his last was \"The Nonsense Show,\" which featured a parade of flying fish, cat-taming mice, and circus animals.\n\"The unknown often brings fear with it,\" he once observed. \"In my books I try to counteract this fear, to replace it with a positive message. I believe that children are naturally creative and eager to learn. I want to show them that learning is really both fascinating and fun.\"\nHis signature illustration technique used pictures pieced together from tissue paper painted in various colors and textures. \"It sounds corny, but I think I connect with the child in me, and I think others do, too,\" he told The Associated Press in 2003. He said he chose to depict animals in unconventional colors to show young readers that, in art, there is no wrong color.\nCarle received lifetime achievement awards from the National Endowment for the Arts and the American Library Association. In 2002, Carle and his wife, Barbara Carle, founded The Eric Carle Museum of Picture Book Art in Amherst, Mass.\nSprinter Lee Evans (February 25, 1947-May 19, 2021), an NCAA champion, set Olympic records in the 400 meter and the 4×400 meter relay at the 1968 Mexico City Games. As a founding member of the Olympic Project for Human Rights (formed to combat housing discrimination at his university), Evans had prepared to protest against racism at the Olympics. But after teammates Tommie Smith and John Carlos were sent home for raising their fists on the winners' podium, Evans was warned by officials not to repeat their act.\nEvans told Counterpunch in 2004 that he was prepared to sit out the rest of the Games after Smith and Carlos were ejected. \"I wanted to go home. I said I wasn't going to run. But Tommy and John, they came to me and said I better run and I better win.\"\nAfter winning the 400, Evans wore a black beret on the podium, in sympathy to the Black Panther Party. \"After what Tommy and John did, what anybody else did was like little or nothing,\" Evans said. But it was enough to attract death threats.\nA San Jose State graduate and Fulbright scholar, Evans followed his Olympic success with professional competition, before coaching track teams in Africa (including three Olympic medal winners from Nigeria), the Middle East, and at South Alabama University. He also coached for the U.S. Special Olympics.\nAs class president in fifth grade he was impeached for \"talking incessantly.\" But acting with bone-dry understatement, Charles Grodin (April 21, 1935-May 18, 2021) could steal entire scenes with just a look.\nHis dead-pan humor enriched such films as \"The Heartbreak Kid,\" \"Heaven Can Wait,\" \"Real Life,\" \"Seems Like Old Times,\" \"The Woman in Red,\" \"The Lonely Guy,\" \"The Great Muppet Caper,\" \"Movers & Shakers,\" \"Ishtar,\" and \"Dave,\" as well as \"Rosemary's Baby\" and \"Catch-22.\" He starred as the father in \"Beethoven\" and its sequel, \"Beethoven's 2nd.\" Grodin is perhaps best remembered for the action-comedy \"Midnight Run,\" as an embezzling accountant being escorted cross-country by Robert De Niro's bounty hunter, being chased by both the feds and the mob.\nOn Broadway, he costarred with Ellen Burstyn in the comedy, \"Same Time, Next Year,\" and directed the plays \"Lovers and Other Strangers,\" \"Thieves\" and \"Unexpected Guests.\" He stepped away from acting for a time beginning in the early '90s, and became a columnist and talk-show host on CNBC and MSNBC. He appeared as a commentator on CBS' \"60 Minutes II,\" and shared an Emmy for writing 1977's \"The Paul Simon Special.\"\nGrodin also wrote several pithy books, including \"It Would Be So Nice If You Weren't Here: My Journey Through Show Business\"; \"How I Got to Be Whoever It Is I Am\"; \"How I Get Through Life\"; and \"I Like It Better When You're Funny,\" describing how his late-night TV \"act,\" in which he brought a cringe-y, combative persona to his conversations with the likes of Johnny Carson and David Letterman, actually played out on \"The Tonight Show\":\n\"It's not that easy to make America uncomfortable, but I had evidently succeeded to an alarming degree,\" he wrote. \"I had even made my friends uncomfortable when they watched me on the show. They would tell me they'd leave the room when I came on, or stay and watch peeking through their fingers. What was I doing to cause such discomfort? I was kidding around. The problem was that only Johnny and a minority of viewers seemed to know it. So when Johnny would ask, 'How are you?' and I would refuse to answer, because I said I didn't believe it mattered to him how I felt — millions shuddered at the rudeness of it all. Plenty laughed, but more shuddered.\"\nActor Norman Lloyd (Nov. 8, 1914-May 11, 2021) had a career that read like a history of Hollywood. After appearing on Broadway, Lloyd joined Orson Welles' Mercury Theatre acting company in the 1930s. His credits included Welles' anti-fascist modern-dress telling of Shakespeare's \"Julius Caesar.\" He also appeared in a 1939 NBC broadcast of a play, \"The Streets of New York,\" a reel of which is the earliest-surviving live TV broadcast from Rockefeller Center.\nIn his first Hollywood feature, Lloyd worked with Alfred Hitchcock, playing a Nazi spy in 1942's \"Saboteur,\" famously dangling from the torch of the Statue of Liberty in the film's thrilling conclusion. He also appeared in Hitchcock's \"Spellbound,\" \"The Unseen,\" \"A Walk in the Sun,\" \"Limelight,\" \"The Flame and the Arrow,\" \"Audrey Rose,\" \"FM,\" \"Dead Poets Society,\" \"The Age of Innocence,\" and the TV series \"Alfred Hitchcock Presents,\" \"Night Gallery,\" \"Kojak,\" \"The Paper Chase,\" \"Wise Guy,\" \"Home Fires,\" \"Murder, She Wrote,\" \"Star Trek: The Next Generation,\" \"Seven Days\" and \"The Practice.\"\nHe was best-known for playing Dr. Daniel Auschlander on the 1980s medical drama, \"St. Elsewhere.\" Lloyd also produced and directed television, earning two Emmy nominations.\nLloyd made his final film appearance, at the age of 100, in the 2015 Amy Schumer comedy \"Trainwreck.\" \"CBS This Morning: Saturday\" co-host Anthony Mason spoke to Lloyd the following year: \"They call you now the oldest living actor – what do you think of that title?\"\n\"I don't really relish it,\" Lloyd replied, \"because it infers that it's age that is giving me some dimension, not the skill of acting. … I'd like to find good parts to play. But there are not many parts for 102-year-old men!\"\n\"But you're available!\" Mason said.\n\"Beautifully put, thank you,\" Lloyd said. \"But acting, well, I'd never stop.\"\nChemist Spencer Silver (Feb. 6, 1941-May 8, 2021) was working at 3M's central research laboratory in 1968, working on chemicals to be used in the production of aircraft, when he discovered a unique adhesive formula.\nIn 2010 Silver wrote in Financial Times that he is sensitive about the word glue: \"Glue is a very simplistic term. You boil animal bones down and make something that sticks when it dries. Adhesives are completely different. They rely on a complex structure of molecules to create their tack and elasticity. The size and structure of the molecules will affect how tacky the adhesive is, and how well it can be removed from whatever it is stuck to, known as peel adhesion. I thought of myself as a molecular architect.\"\nSilver's find was an adhesive (or acrylate copolymer microspheres) that had high \"tack\" but low \"peel,\" and was reusable. But he was frustrated in coming up with a proper use for his unique adhesive, and began giving seminars to 3M's product developers. It was, he explained, a \"solution waiting for a problem to solve.\"\nIn 1974, colleague Art Fry came up with the idea of using the adhesive to prevent paper bookmarks from falling out of his hymnal when he sang in his church's choir. His team tested the re-usable note among staffers, and then introduced it in select markets. The product was originally called the Press 'n' Peel memo pad, but in 1980 it was renamed the Post-it Note – a name that stuck. It is now an indelible entry in office supplies, and one of the top-selling items in 3M's consumer products division.\nDuring his time at 3M Silver earned 37 patents, and won several awards, including the 1998 American Chemical Society Award for Creative Invention, according to the company.\nBorn in Germany and a graduate from Technische Hochschule in Munich, architect Helmut Jahn (Jan. 4, 1940-May 8, 2021) moved to Chicago in 1966 to study under modernist architect Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, and would become a leading proponent of postmodernism.\nJahn, who taught at the University of Illinois Chicago, Harvard University, Yale University and the Illinois Institute of Technology, began his professional career in 1967 when he joined CF Murphy Associates (which later became Murphy/Jahn). Among his projects were Chicago's McCormick Place, the United Airlines terminal at O'Hare International Airport (including a walkway famous for its colorful lighting), and the J. Edgar Hoover Building, the FBI's headquarters, in Washington, D.C.   One of his more controversial buildings was the James R. Thompson Center (originally the State of Illinois Center), a glass-sheathed, Illinois government office building in Chicago's Loop that opened in 1985.\nHis later collaborations with engineers evolved into buildings that, he told the website ArchDaily, were the product of what he called archineering – a collaboration from an early stage in which performance and materials were more important than aesthetics.\nJahn's work internationally included the 63-story Messeturm in Frankfurt, Sony Center in Berlin, and the Suvarnabhumi Airport in Bangkok, Thailand.\nJahn decried clients who were not supportive of innovation, supposedly because of cost: \"Most clients are afraid to run into a risk of making a mistake,\" he told ArchDaily. \"And that's the biggest handicap in terms of making progress.\n\"Architecture,\" he said, \"is all about going with your gut.\"\nThe Orvis company, founded in 1856 by Charles F. Orvis, was a niche fly-fishing supply company based in Manchester, Vt. (not far from the headwaters of the Batten Kill, a renowned trout stream), when lifelong outdoorsman Leigh Perkins (Nov. 27, 1927-May 7, 2021) bought it in 1965 for $400,000. Over the next 27 years, Perkins transformed it into a global retailer and mail-order supplier of outdoor sports products and apparel, with sales that topped $90 million.\nIn 1966, Perkins began what the company describes as the world's first fly-fishing schools, first in Vermont and then elsewhere, which helped introduce thousands of anglers to fly fishing.\nPerkins served on the boards of The Nature Conservancy and the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation, among other environmental organizations. Perkins also directed the company to donate 5% of its pre-tax profits to conserving fish and wildlife. According to Orvis, with its matching grant program, the company and its customers have donated more than $20 million over the past 25 years.\nPerkins, who'd once been kicked out of boarding school because he'd played hooky in order to go fishing, spent 250 days a year hunting and fishing around the world, even before he retired from the company in 1992. Today, second- and third-generation Perkinses run Orvis, which in 2020 had sales of more than $9 billion.\n\"There is only one reason in the world to go fishing: to enjoy yourself,\" Perkins told The New York Times in 1992. \"Anything that detracts from enjoying yourself is to be avoided.\"\nActress and model Tawny Kitaen (August 5, 1961-May 7, 2021) appeared on the cover of two albums by the heavy metal band RATT, including 1984's \"Out of the Cellar,\" before becoming an early star of music videos on MTV, including the 1987 Whitesnake smash \"Here I Go Again,\" which featured Kitaen performing cartwheels on the hood of a Jaguar.\nIn a 2016 interview with Rock n Roll Junkie, Kitaen described shooting the music video, her first: \"They had everything all set up which was like shooting for a major motion picture. Paula Abdul was there with Marty Callner, the director, who had hired her to give me some routines and choreography. I told her I was a ballerina and I was a gymnast, so she asked me to show her what I had. So, I did a few things and she turned around to Marty and said, 'She's got this and doesn't need me,' and she left. That was the greatest compliment. So, I got on the cars and Marty would say, 'Action,' and I'd do whatever I felt like doing.\"\nOther music video appearances, which received heavy play on MTV,  included \"Still of the Night\"; \"Is This Love\"; and \"The Deeper the Love.\"\nShe also starred opposite Tom Hanks in the 1984 comedy \"Bachelor Party.\" Other credits included the TV movie \"Malibu\"; \"The Perils of Gwendoline in the Land of the Yik-Yak\"; a \"Seinfeld\" episode as Jerry's actress-girlfriend; \"Witchboard\"; \"White Hot\"; \"Capitol\"; \"The New WKRP in Cincinnati\"; co-hosting \"America's Funniest People\"; and the animated \"Eek! The Cat.\"\nShe also appeared on reality shows, including \"The Surreal Life,\" and \"Celebrity Rehab with Dr. Drew.\"\nSinger-songwriter Lloyd Price (March 9, 1933-May 3, 2021) was more than just an early star of rock 'n roll, bringing the sound of New Orleans jazz and blues to the top of the R&B charts, and crossing over to White audiences with hits such as \"Personality\" and \"Stagger Lee.\" Known as \"Mr. Personality,\" he was also a maverick in the industry, running his own label,  KRC Records, before stars such as Frank Sinatra did the same; holding onto his publishing rights; and serving as his own agent and manager.\nBorn in Kenner, Louisiana, one of 11 siblings, Price taught himself the piano as a youngster, and in his teens wrote his first hit, \"Lawdy Miss Clawdy,\" while working in his mother's restaurant, Beatrice's Fish 'n' Fry. Recorded with Fats Domino on piano, \"Lawdy Miss Clawdy\" sold more than 1 million copies, and sat at #1 on the R&B chart for seven weeks. It would later be covered by such stars as Elvis Presley, Little Richard, The Beatles and Joe Cocker.\nHe recorded \"Ain't It a Shame,\" \"Restless Heart\" and \"Tell Me Pretty Baby\" before performing military service. He returned with the 1957 ballad \"Just Because,\" and hit #1 with his rendition of the folk song \"Stagger Lee,\" about a fatal barroom fight over a dice game. Pressed to sing a less violent version for Dick Clark's \"American Bandstand,\" Price revised the lyrics – the two men work out their differences amicably. \"I had to go make up some lyrics about Stagger Lee and Billy being in some kind of squabble about a girl,\" Price told Billboard magazine in 2013. \"It didn't make any sense at all. It was ridiculous.\"\nOther hits followed, including \"Personality,\" \"I'm Going to Get Married,\" \"Come Into My Heart,\" \"Lady Luck\" and \"Question.\"\nAs the pop music scene in the '60s changed, Price's career in music continued. He helped found the Double L Records label that gave an early break to Wilson Pickett, and ran a New York nightclub. He migrated to Nigeria following the 1969 murder of his longtime business partner, and helped stage championship bouts between Joe Frazier and Muhammad Ali, and Ali and George Foreman. In the '80s he returned to the States, where he become a favorite on oldies tours, performing with Little Richard and Jerry Lee Lewis, among others.\nIn a 1998 interview with Larry Katz, Price credited clean living and a steady focus for his endurance. \"I never drank, smoked, used drugs or had bad habits,\" he said. \"I never was starstruck. I had 23 hit records and I never looked for the next record to hit. I never had that need that they had to be somebody. I just wanted to be.\"\nHe was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1998.\nIn his 2015 memoir \"sumdumhonky,\" Price wrote about the transitions he'd seen over eight decades: \"Time brings about change, and the change of my generation was about one thing: music. It brought people together like nothing had ever before.\"\nPut into dance class by his mother at the age of seven to keep him off the streets, Jacques d'Amboise (July 28, 1934-May 2, 2021) was just 15 when George Balanchine recruited him for the New York City Ballet. He performed on its stage for almost 35 years.\nHe also appeared in the movies (in \"Seven Brides for Seven Brothers\" and \"Carousel\") and on Broadway (in \"Shinbone Alley\").\nD'Amboise devoted his later years to giving kids the same chance he had, through the National Dance Institute, which he founded in 1976. His classes extended the rigors and joys of dance to children who were deaf or blind as well. A 1983 documentary about d'Amboise and the Institute, \"He Makes Me Feel Like Dancin',\" won an Oscar for Best Documentary Feature, as well as a Peabody and four Emmy Awards.\nA MacArthur Fellow, d'Amboise was a Kennedy Center Honoree and a recipient of the National Medal of the Arts.\nAs an educator he was motivated, he told \"Sunday Morning\" in 1980, by one compelling idea: \"The arts, all of them, should be part of the curriculum of the schools and should be part of our life – the center of our life, not the periphery.\"\nHe worked at his dad's service station on Route 66 and raced jalopies at a New Mexico speedway. He would become part of a premier racing family that has taken home the Indianapolis 500 trophy nine times. Bobby Unser (Feb. 20, 1934-May 2, 2021) notched three of those victories, in 1968, 1975 and 1981.\nUnser was one of six members of the Unser family to race in the Indy 500 (an older brother, Jerry, died after a crash preparing for the 1959 race). Bobby's brother, Al, won four times, while his nephew, Al Unser Jr., won in 1992 and 1994.\nAfter a stint in the U.S. Air Force, Bobby's racing career would bring him a record 13 wins at the Pikes Peak International in Colorado. He was the first driver in Indy car competition to record a 200-mph qualifying average speed. He notched 35 career Indy car wins, and four International Race of Champions (IROC) wins.\nHis final Indy 500 victory was disputed. Unser won from the pole and beat Mario Andretti by 5.18 seconds in a Penske PC-9B, but officials ruled Unser passed cars illegally while exiting the pit lane under caution – drawing a penalty that docked him one position, and moved Andretti to winner. Unser and the Penske team appealed, and the penalty was rescinded in October of that year. Though fined $40,000, Unser was declared winner, for the 35th, and final, victory of his career.\nUnser moved from the driver's seat to the broadcasting booth, winning an Emmy Award as part of ABC Sports' coverage of the 1989 Indianapolis 500. He was also broadcasting when the   checkered flag was waved on both his brother and nephew.\nIn 1993, at the Bonneville Salt Flat, he clocked 223.709 mph, a land speed record that stood for 18 years.\nIn later years Unser was a driver coach who assisted on race strategy in 1998 and 1999 when his son, Robby Unser, finished fifth and eighth.\nIn addition to racing, Unser was also a pilot, buying his first Cessna in the late 1950s, and commuting by air to races and endorsement events. He told Plane and Pilot Magazine in 2016 that flying initially scared the daylights out of him: he is afraid of heights, and is horrified at the notion of a stall. \"Stalls petrify me. It's serious, even to this day,\" said the man who drove a car at 223 mph.\nActress Olympia Dukakis (June 20, 1931-May 1, 2021) won an Academy Award for her performance as the mother of Cher in \"Moonstruck\" (1987), but she admitted at the time that her ambition had never been to win an Oscar. It was, she said, \"to play the great parts.\"\nThe Massachusetts native's love of theater drew her to the stage even after her Greek immigrant parents had dissuaded her, pressing upon her the importance of an education in a more practical field. Olympia got a degree in physical therapy, and worked at hospitals in West Virginia and Boston, before going on to study drama at Boston University. After appearing in summer stock in Williamstown, Mass., she won an Obie Award for her off-Broadway performance in Bertolt Brecht's \"A Man's a Man.\"\nThe lure of \"great parts\" would lead her to performing in or directing productions of Strindberg and Chekov, Greek and Shakespearean tragedy, and modern classics, including \"Mother Courage and Her Children,\" \"Long Day's Journey into Night,\" \"The Rose Tattoo.\" \"Titus Andronicus,\" \"Peer Gynt,\" \"The Memorandum,\" and \"Curse of the Starving Class.\" When she and her actor-husband Louis Zorich moved from New York City to Montclair, N.J. to raise a family, they co-founded the Whole Theater Company there, specializing in classic dramas. Dukakis was artistic director.\nHer screen credits in the 1960s and '70s were limited (she was a police officer in the Charles Bronson revenge flick \"Death Wish\"), but she won her \"Moonstruck\" role by the fluke of having been cut from the movie \"Heartburn.\" Its director, Mike Nichols, made it up to her by casting Dukakis in Broadway's \"Social Security.\" Director Norman Jewison saw her in the show, and cast her in \"Moonstruck.\"\nHer Oscar win brought her roles in such films as \"Look Who's Talking,\" \"Steel Magnolias,\" \"Dad,\" \"The Cemetery Club,\" \"I Love Trouble,\" \"Mighty Aphrodite,\" \"Mr. Holland's Opus,\" \"Picture Perfect,\" \"Cloudburst,\" and \"Away From Her.\" Her TV credits include \"Armistead Maupin's Tales of the City\" and its sequels, the mini-series \"Sinatra,\" \"Lucky Day,\" \"Joan of Arc,\" \"My Beautiful Son,\" \"Bored to Death,\" and \"Center of the Universe.\"\nShe was the subject of a recent documentary, \"Olympia,\" in which she recounts her career, accepts honors, meets fans in a supermarket, visits her ancestral home on the Greek isle of Lesbos, and talks of the lineage of female power.\nIn 2015 Dukakis talked to the AV Club about her desire for \"extraordinary experiences\" in plays: \"It was kind of a way of finding out who I was. The play was the vehicle through which I found out who I was. I got to tap into whatever the play was asking me to tap into. So, it became a way to self-discovery.\"\nStudent reporter Damon Weaver (April 1, 1998-May 1, 2021) was just 11 years old when he gained national acclaim for interviewing President Barack Obama at the White House in 2009 – one of the youngest people ever to have interviewed a sitting president.\nWeaver, who got his start in journalism in fifth grade when he volunteered for the school newscast at K.E. Cunningham/Canal Point Elementary in Florida, asked questions that focused primarily on education – funding of schools in poorer communities, lunch programs, bullying, conflict resolution, and how to succeed.\nWeaver then asked Mr. Obama to be his \"homeboy,\" saying then-Vice President Joe Biden had already accepted. \"Absolutely,\" the president smiled, shaking the boy's hand. Weaver later told CBS' \"The Early Show,\" \"The president is a normal person.\"\nWeaver used that meeting to later interview Oprah Winfrey, Colin Powell, Caroline Kennedy, Samuel L. Jackson, and basketball player Dwyane Wade.\nLast year he graduated from Albany State University in Georgia, remarking on Instagram that, \"At 22 I have beaten so many statistics against Black men raised without a father. Challenged by so many things I still did it! … this is not much compared to what I will do in the future!\"\nWhen President John F. Kennedy called for \"landing a man on the moon,\" he added the directive, \"and returning him safely to the Earth,\" which may have been the more difficult part of the Moon Shot. And no one person was perhaps more responsible for the success of that than astronaut Michael Collins (October 31, 1930-April 28, 2021), who flew Apollo 11's command module while Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin descended to the moon's surface in the lunar lander.\nIn 2019, marking the 50th anniversary of Apollo 11, Collins told \"Sunday Morning,\" \"I felt that we were fulfilling, if successful, [Kennedy's] mandate. And I was just thrilled to be a piece of the whole thing.\"\nAfter graduating from the U.S. Military Academy in 1952 (a year behind Aldrin), Collins became a fighter pilot and test pilot with the U.S. Air Force, and applied to NASA following John Glenn's successful Mercury flight. He first flew in space as part of the two-man Gemini 10 mission, in 1966, during which he and crewmate John Young performed a spacewalk, retrieved an experiment left behind in orbit by a previous Gemini flight, and practiced docking maneuvers necessary for a moon landing. During his spacewalk, Collins lost a camera, an early example of \"space debris.\"\nIn July 1969, while Armstrong and Aldrin were putting their footprints on the lunar surface, Collins circled the moon aboard Columbia. As his craft flew around the far side he was completely out of touch with NASA – and further away from Earth than any human had ever been. \"When I was behind the moon I later discovered I was being described as, oh, lonely, lonely, lonely,\" he said. \"I was happy back there. I had my own little domain. And actually, going down and touching the moon, eh, that was not high on my list.\"\nCollins would be responsible for successfully docking the orbiting command module with the lander once Armstrong and Aldrin had blasted off from the Sea of Tranquility. Collins told \"Sunday Morning\" he was delighted to be reunited with them: \"I was about to kiss Buzz Aldrin on the forehead, and I decided maybe no, no, I think the history books wouldn't like that! It was a wonderful instant in time.\"\nUpon returning to Earth, Collins was met with adulation the world over. \"I was flabbergasted,\" he said. \"I thought that when we went someplace they'd say, 'Well, congratulations. You Americans finally did it.' And instead of that, unanimously the reaction was, 'We did it. We humans finally left this planet. We did it.'\"\nAfter Apollo 11, Collins joined the State Department as assistant secretary for public affairs. He then joined the Smithsonian Institution, leading a team planning the National Air and Space Museum, eventually becoming its director.\nIn a preface to his book for young readers, \"Flying to the Moon: An Astronaut's Story,\" Collins urged more spending on space exploration, including a crewed mission to Mars. \"I am too old to fly to Mars, and I regret that,\" he wrote. \"But I still think I have been very, very lucky. I was born in the days of biplanes and Buck Rogers, learned to fly in the early jets, and hit my peak when moon rockets came along. That's hard to beat.\"\nThe son of a Methodist minister and a music teacher, Vice President Walter Mondale (January 5, 1928-April 19, 2021) served in the Army during the Korean War before becoming a lawyer in Minneapolis. Entering politics in 1960, he was appointed the state's Attorney General before being appointed to the Senate in 1964, filling the seat vacated by Vice President Hubert Humphrey. He advocated for social issues, such as education, housing, migrant workers and child nutrition, and was an outspoken supporter of civil rights.\nSelected as Georgia Governor Jimmy Carter's running mate in 1976, Mondale would go on to reinvent the role of vice president, becoming more of a senior adviser and governing partner to the president, rather than a constitutional afterthought. The first VP to occupy an office within the White House, Mondale was heavily involved in foreign policy and frequently traveled overseas. He was part of the 1978 Camp David Accords that led to a peace treaty between Egypt and Israel.\nHe ran for president against incumbent Ronald Reagan in 1984, and made history by choosing a female running mate, New York Representative Geraldine Ferraro. President Reagan trounced Mondale in a historic landslide, after the Democrat said he would raise taxes as president. Mondale accepted the blame for the historic loss himself, adding, \"You know, I've never really warmed up to television. In fairness to television, it never really warmed up to me.\"\nYears later, Mondale said his campaign message had proven to be the right one. \"History has vindicated me that we would have to raise taxes,\" he said. \"It was very unpopular, but it was undeniably correct.\"\nMondale returned to practicing law and served as U.S. Ambassador to Japan during the Clinton administration.\nIn 2002, he was asked by Minnesota Democrats to run for the Senate again, stepping in after Senator Paul Wellstone was killed in a plane crash days before Election Day. He narrowly lost to Republican Norm Coleman.\nHe was gracious to the end: \"We fought the good fight, and every one of us should feel good about that,\" he said.\nGrammy-winning composer Jim Steinman (November 1, 1947-April 19, 2021) penned hits for Meat Loaf, Celine Dion, Air Supply, Barry Manilow and Bonnie Tyler.\nSteinman wrote the music for Meat Loaf's classic debut album, \"Bat Out of Hell,\" including the songs \"You Took the Words Right Out of My Mouth (Hot Summer Night),\" \"Heaven Can Wait,\" \"Two Out of Three Ain't Bad,\" and \"Paradise by the Dashboard Light.\" Released in 1977, it became one of the top-selling albums of all time. Sixteen years later, Steinman composed a sequel album, \"Bat Out of Hell II: Back into Hell\" (which featured the hit \"I'd Do Anything for Love (But I Won't Do That)\"), and, later, \"Bat Out of Hell III: The Monster Is Loose.\"\nSteinman's other hits included Tyler's \"Total Eclipse of the Heart,\" and Air Supply's \"Making Love Out of Nothing at All.\" Dion's 1997 album \"Falling Into You\" (which included Steinman's \"It's All Coming Back to Me Now\") won the Grammy for Album of the Year. Steinman also contributed songs to the soundtracks of \"Streets of Fire\" (\"Tonight Is What It Means to Be Young\" and \"Nowhere Fast\") and \"Footloose\" (\"Holding Out for a Hero\").\nThe sweep of his rock ballads stemmed from his early fascination with opera. While at Amherst College in the late 1960s he composed and starred in \"Dream Engine\" (which he later described as \"a three-hour rock epic with tons of nudity\"). It got him noticed, and led to work at Joseph Papp's Public Theater in New York (including \"Kid Champion,\" starring Christopher Walken), and his first commercial release. He also cowrote \"Rhinegold,\" a take on Wagner's Ring Cycle.\nHe returned to the theater, collaborating with Andrew Lloyd Webber on the musical \"Whistle Down the Wind,\" writing the music for Roman Polanski's \"Dance of the Vampires,\" and creating a stage show based on \"Bat Out of Hell.\"\nHe was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2012.\nOn his website, jimsteinman.com, the composer of \"Wagnerian rock\" was quoted about music genres: \"I think rock and opera are probably closer to each other than to other musical forms. Rock and opera both make huge gestures, they're both about extremes in content and form. Each puts incredible physical demands on a performer. And each of them has a great mix of the sublime and the ridiculous, heroism and humor. Seems to me that people's barriers to enjoying both have more to do with sociology than actual music and performances.\"\nActor and stuntman Felix Silla (January 11, 1937-April 16, 2021) was most famous for playing a character which made him virtually invisible: the hairy Cousin Itt on TV's \"The Addams Family.\" Silla (who stood 3'11\") was covered with a floor-length hairpiece, sunglasses and a bowler hat. He proved memorable even though he had no dialogue (at least nothing that was decipherable by a non-Addams).\nBorn in Italy, Silla was a trapeze artist, acrobat and horse rider who toured with the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus, before beginning a Hollywood career as a stuntman, often doubling for children (including in \"The Towering Inferno,\" \"The Hindenburg\" and \"Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom\").\nSilla also portrayed a robot on the TV series \"Buck Rogers in the 25th Century\"; an Ewok in \"Return of the Jedi\"; and a computer-sired baby in \"Demon Seed.\" Other credits included \"The Black Bird,\" \"Battlestar Galactica,\" \"Spaceballs,\" \"The Golden Child,\" \"Poltergeist\" and \"Batman Returns.\" In-between film appearances, he performed with his musical combo, The Original Harmonica Band.\nAcademy Award-winning costumer designer Anthony Powell (June 2, 1935-April 16, 2021) earned his first Oscar with his second film assignment, 1972's \"Travels With My Aunt,\" starring Maggie Smith. He followed with a magnificent range of historical and fantasy assignments: \"Papillon\"; \"Buffalo Bill and the Indians, or Sitting Bull's History Lesson\"; \"Sorcerer\"; two more Oscar-winners, \"Death on the Nile\" and \"Tess\" (pictured); \"Priest of Love\"; \"Evil Under the Sun\"; \"Ishtar\"; \"Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade\"; \"Hook\"; \"101 Dalmations\" and its sequel; \"The Avengers\"; and \"Miss Potter.\"\nHe won a Tony Award in 1963 for \"The School for Scandal\" and was nominated in 1995 for the musical \"Sunset Boulevard.\" Other stage credits include \"Amadeus,\" \"Private Lives,\" \"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer,\" \"My Fair Lady,\" and \"Singin' in the Rain.\"\nIn 2016 he talked with the British Film Institute about his initial fears of doing a Roman Polanski project (which fell apart before filming) set in ancient Pompeii, featuring a cast \"wrapped in sheets.\"\n\"When I got the script, most of it seemed to happen in the sewers of Pompeii with Roman sewer workers, and I was flummoxed. I didn't know how to make it interesting,\" Powell said. \"So I went to see Roman and I said, 'Look, I don't know how to do it.' … And afterwards I realized I'd absolutely panicked. Any job, even if you think you can't do it, once you start working on it, something happens.\"\nFor more than seven decades, through socio-economic upheavals, wars, a dwindling of empire, and withering family scandals, Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh (June 10, 1921-April 9, 2021), husband of Queen Elizabeth II, was Britain's longest-serving consort. He provided support to the woman who began her reign at the age of 25, through a period of history when the British royal family was forced to reinvent itself to accommodate the public's more inquisitive view of the monarchy, as well as the British press' increasingly skeptical view of the House of Windsor.\nThe queen referred to Philip as \"her rock,\" and her \"strength and stay.\"\nBorn into the Greek royal family, with ancestors of Danish, German and Russian extraction (he was himself a great-great-grandson of Queen Victoria), the athletic Philip gave up a promising naval career when Elizabeth became queen, but nonetheless fulfilled more than 22,000 royal engagements during his career – promoting U.K. industry and science, advocating for the environment, serving as patron for hundreds of charities (including outdoor programs for children), and traveling widely to boost British interests abroad. He worked for decades to support the World Wildlife Fund, and served as its international president from 1981 to 1996.\nAnd while he always walked a step or two behind his queen, Philip played a prominent part in raising their four children, including his eldest, Prince Charles, the heir to the throne. He managed the royal estate, painted, and collected modern art. But he once said, \"the arts world thinks of me as an uncultured, polo-playing clot.\"\nIn his later years, Philip acquired the image of an elderly, philosophical observer of the times, who maintained a military bearing while speaking his mind. Blunt, impatient and demanding, he was occasionally criticized for making racist or sexist remarks.\nTo a friend's suggestion that he ease up a bit on his royal responsibilities, the prince is said to have replied, \"Well, what would I do? Sit around and knit?\"\nBut in 2011, when he turned 90, Philip told the BBC he was \"winding down\" his workload, reckoning that he had \"done my bit.\"\nEarl Simmons, who performed under the name DMX (December 18, 1970-April 9, 2021), was the Grammy-nominated hip-hop artist behind the songs \"Ruff Ryders' Anthem\" and \"Party Up (Up in Here).\"\nUsing a trademark delivery often paired with growls, barks and \"What!\" as an ad-lib, DMX built a multiplatinum career as one of rap's biggest stars of the late 1990s and early 2000s. But he also struggled with drug addiction, and spent about 30 stints in jail, beginning at age 10.\nHis first studio album, 1998's \"It's Dark and Hell is Hot,\" debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 chart, and featured such hits as \"Get at Me Dog,\" \"Stop Being Greedy\" and \"How It's Goin' Down.\" His next four albums – \"... And Then There Was X,\" \"Flesh of My Flesh, Blood of My Blood,\" \"The Great Depression\" and \"Grand Champ\" – each topped the charts as well, followed by \"Year of the Dog … Again,\" which reached #2.\nDMX also charted an acting career, starring in the 1998 film \"Belly\" and appearing in \"Romeo Must Die,\" \"Exit Wounds\" and \"Cradle 2 the Grave.\"\nIn a 2019 interview with GQ magazine DMX talked about his relationship with his mother, who had violently abused him as a child: \"I think a lot of people struggle with forgiving their parents. In fact, I personally struggle with forgiving my parents. But until you learn how to forgive others, you can't forgive yourself. You can't forgive yourself if you don't know how to forgive.\"\nAn original writer for \"Saturday Night Live,\" Emmy-winner Anne Beatts (February 25, 1947-April 7, 2021) was the first female editor of National Lampoon magazine, and a lyricist for the Off-Broadway musical parody of Woodstock, \"National Lampoon's Lemmings.\" She worked from the launch of \"SNL\" in 1975 to 1980, helping to create such characters as the nerds Lisa Loopner and Todd DiLaMuca; oily toy salesman Irwin Mainway; and \"Fred Garvin, Male Prostitute.\"\n[Pictured: Anne Beatts in 2015, with a photo of her with head \"SNL\" writer and then-boyfriend Michael O'Donoghue.]\nShe was a co-writer of Gilda Radner's stage show, \"Gilda Live,\" before becoming one of TV's first female show runners on the CBS sitcom \"Square Pegs.\" The cult comedy (which sadly lasted only one season) was a rarity for presenting a teenage girl's perspective – and for hiring an almost exclusively-female writers' room.\nBeatts also served as a producer for \"A Different World,\" \"The Stephanie Miller Show,\" and \"John Waters Presents: Movies That Will Corrupt You,\" and wrote episodes of \"Murphy Brown,\" \"Faerie Tale Theatre,\" and \"Committed.\" She also co-edited the 1976 collection of humor by women, \"Titters,\" and lectured at Chapman University's Dodge College of Film and Media Arts.\nIn 2015 Beatts told writer Joy Press (author of a book on women in television, \"Stealing the Show\") that working in the male-dominated worlds of comedy and TV was an exercise in self-defense: \"I was going to work harder and stay up longer,\" she said. \"Essentially you find out that if you try to be one of the guys, you just end up being a slightly defective guy. …\n\"One of the issues in Hollywood is there are girls and ladies but there weren't a lot of women. Just to be a regular woman was not a role that was recognized. A man has to invade a small country to be called aggressive, but with a woman, if she hangs up the phone on someone, that's it.\"\nA founding member of the Latin-funk group War (or ***, as it came to be referenced owing to a trademark dispute with their manager), vocalist and bassist Morris \"B.B.\" Dickerson (August 3, 1949-April 2, 2021) played on a dozen of the group's studio album releases and co-wrote some of their most memorable songs.\nThe musicians of War, who'd played with former quarterback and R&B singer Deacon Jones, originally partnered with Eric Burdon (former lead singer of The Animals) to release their debut album in 1970 (which featured the single \"Spill the Wine\"), and shared the stage with Jimi Hendrix in London in what was the guitarist's final public performance. After Burdon and War parted ways during a 1971 European tour, War continued with such hits as \"Why Can't We Be Friends,\" \"Slippin' Into Darkness,\" \"Low Rider,\" \"Cisco Kid,\" \"Summer,\" and \"The World Is a Ghetto.\"\nIn 1972, following an appearance at the Newport Jazz Festival, Dickerson explained the ethos of the group, which was multi-ethnic and blended multiple genres of music, to the New York Post: \"We contribute to each other spiritually, and that's what we are trying to project – the dude in the street selling papers, the dude working at the steel mill, again, everybody.\"\nYears after leaving War in 1979, Dickerson reunited with other founding members to tour under the name Lowrider Band.\nPulitzer Prize-winning author Larry McMurtry (June 3, 1936-March 25, 2021) wove tales of the American West both historic and contemporary, which depicted characters who were often shaped by the rugged, hard-scrabble landscapes of the frontier, their personas worn down into raw, unguarded emotions.\nBorn into a family of ranchers, McMurtry wrote his first novel at the age of 25. \"Horseman, Pass By\" would be made into a film starring Paul Newman, retitled \"Hud,\" that won three Oscars. Others from among his dozens of novels included \"Leaving Cheyenne,\" \"The Last Picture Show,\" \"The Desert Rose,\" \"The Last Picture Show,\" \"Moving On,\" \"All My Friends Are Going To Be Strangers,\" \"Terms of Endearment,\" \"The Evening Star,\" and \"Texasville.\"\nHis Pulitzer-Prize winning epic \"Lonesome Dove,\" about former Texas Rangers leading a cattle drive across the Great Plains during the 1870s, was turned into an Emmy-winning CBS miniseries that starred Robert Duvall, Tommy Lee Jones and Angelica Huston. \"'Lonesome Dove' was an effort to kind of demythologize the myth of the Old West,\" McMurtry told The Associated Press in a 2014 interview. The book launched a series of novels that included \"Streets of Laredo,\" \"Dead Man's Walk\" and \"Comanche Moon.\"\nAs a screenwriter he shared an Academy Award nomination for the script of \"The Last Picture Show,\" based on his coming-of-age novel set in a small Texas town, and shared an Oscar for the script of \"Brokeback Mountain,\" the 2005 film, based on an Annie Proulx short story, that starred Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal as cowboys who fall in love.\nHis most recent novel, \"The Last Kind Words Saloon,\" was published in 2014.\nIn 2006 McMurtry explained to \"Sunday Morning\" correspondent Rita Braver his method of working – banging away on one of his nine Hermes typewriters, every day, regardless of weekend or vacation. \"You know, I have no ideas until I sit down at this machine,\" he said. \"I can't talk abstractly about anything. I don't think about it. I do it at the same time every day, and whatever process I have starts when I hit the keys and stops when I get to the end of five pages.\"\nHe told Braver he wasn't bothered by fans who might object to the spinner of western tales writing about gay cowboys. \"It doesn't present any kind of agenda, any politics at all, one way or the other at all,\" McMurtry said. \"It just says life is not for sissies. You know, you need strength. Love is not easy. If you find it, it's not easy. If you don't find it, it's not easy. It's not easy if you find it, but it doesn't work out … The strong survive, but not everybody is the strong, and many people don't.\"\nAuthor Beverly Cleary (April 12, 1916-March 25, 2021) was something of a late starter, writing her first children's book, \"Henry Huggins,\" when she was in her early 30s.\n\"I was a children's librarian,\" Cleary told \"CBS Evening News\" correspondent John Blackstone in 2010, \"and a little boy said to me, 'Where are the books about kids like us?' Well, there weren't any.\"\nFor the next five decades, Cleary contributed more than three dozen children's and young adult novels about \"kids like them,\" that were both reminiscent of her childhood in Portland, Ore., and fantastical (\"The Mouse and the Motorcycle\" told of a mouse who delivers life-saving medicine on a toy motorcycle).\nCleary wrote two long-running series, each featuring Henry Huggins and Ramona Quimby (who appeared in the first Huggins novel, and would star in eight books of her own). In 1981, \"Ramona and Her Mother\" won the National Book Award. \"Dear Mr. Henshaw,\" the touching story of a lonely boy who corresponds with a children's book author, won the 1984 John Newbery Medal. \"Ramona and Her Father\" and \"Ramona Quimby, Age 8\" were named Newbery Honor Books. And she was awarded a National Medal of the Arts by President Bush in 2003.\nCleary also wrote two autobiographical books for young readers: \"A Girl from Yamhill\" (about her childhood), and \"My Own Two Feet\" (about the years leading up to her literary career).\n\"I seem to have grown up with an unusual memory,\" Cleary told the Associated Press. \"People are astonished at the things I remember. I think it comes from living in isolation on a farm the first six years of my life where my main activity was observing.\"\nThe resume of Emmy-winning actress Jessica Walter (January 31, 1941-March 23, 2021) was characterized as that of a character actress, although she excelled in the lead role of a psychotic radio station caller in the Clint Eastwood thriller \"Play Misty for Me.\" More in line with her comic agility was her turn as scheming Lucille Bluth, mother of a dysfunctional family, on TV's \"Arrested Development\"\nIn a 2012 interview with the AV Club, Walter said playing \"difficult\" roles was more fun: \"They're juicy, much better than playing the vanilla ingénues, you know – Miss Vanilla Ice Cream.\"\nA graduate of New York's High School of the Performing Arts, Walter had established a stage career by her early 20s, making her Broadway debut in \"Advise and Consent,\" and appearing most recently in the 2011 revival of \"Anything Goes.\"\nShe starred in the soap opera \"Love of Life\" from 1962 to 1965, and appeared in numerous TV series, including \"Naked City,\" \"Route 66,\" \"The Alfred Hitchcock Hour,\" \"The Fugitive,\" \"Flipper,\" \"The FBI,\" \"Medical Center,\" \"Love, American Style,\" \"McCloud,\" \"The Streets of San Francisco,\" \"Wonder Woman,\" \"Trapper  John, M.D.,\" \"90210,\" \"One Life to Live,\" and \"The Big Bang Theory.\" Walter won an Emmy in 1975 starring in \"Amy Prentiss,\" a spin-off of the San Francisco cop show \"Ironside.\"\nFilm roles included \"Lilith,\" \"The Group,\" \"Grand Prix,\" \"Bye Bye Braverman,\" \"Number One,\" and \"The Flamingo Kid.\"\nWith her second husband, actor Ron Leibman, she starred on stage in Neil Simon's \"Rumors,\" and they shared voice work as husband and wife on the animated series \"Archer,\" parents of the eponymous spy.\n\"I've played lots of mothers from Hell,\" Walter said, commenting on her character Malory Archer. \"Or maybe, for instance, with 'Arrested Development,' Lucille really does believe that she's being a good mother. It's interesting and challenging to find the levels that make them characters you love to hate.\"\nHe was best known as a comic actor playing lovable jerks, as well as a banjo player, strumming with the Beverly Hills Unlisted Jazz Band. But George Segal (February 13, 1934-March 23, 2021) earned his Oscar nomination for Mike Nichols' bitter drama, \"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\"\nSegal had worked with Nichols on Broadway in \"The Knack,\" and when Robert Redford turned down the role of a young professor in \"Virginia Woolf,\" he asked Segal. \"We rehearsed for about a month,\" Segal recalled to Film Talk in 2016. \"So, we could have opened that on a stage. By the time we were shooting, we were all very comfortable in our roles.\"\nA student of Lee Strasberg and Uta Hagen, Segal appeared on Broadway in Eugene O'Neill's \"The Iceman Cometh,\" before being drafted into the Army. After his discharge in 1957, he returned to the stage and began getting small film roles, including \"The Young Doctors,\" \"The Longest Day,\" \"Ship of Fools,\" and \"King Rat.\"\nSegal followed his \"Virginia Woolf\" success with the dramatic (\"The Quiller Memorandum,\" \"The St. Valentine's Day Massacre,\" \"No Way to Treat a Lady,\" \"The Terminal Man\"); the comic (\"Bye Bye Braverman,\" \"Where's Poppa,\" \"The Owl and the Pussycat,\" \"The Hot Rock,\" \"A Touch of Class,\" \"The Duchess and the Dirtwater Fox,\" \"Who Is Killing the Great Chefs of Europe?,\" \"Fun With Dick and Jane\"); and a very '70s mix of the two (\"Loving,\" \"Blume in Love,\" \"California Split\").\nHis later TV career would capitalize on his gift for lighthearted comedy, playing magazine publisher Jack Gallo on \"Just Shoot Me,\" and Albert \"Pops\" Solomon, the grandfather on \"The Goldbergs.\"\nIn 2017 Segal told Variety, \" I've always considered myself to be a lucky person. When I'm asked about the ups-and-downs of my career, I mainly see a lucky guy.\"\nGlynn Lunney (November 27, 1936-March 19, 2021), who had helped devise the complex flight rules used to govern America's space missions throughout the Mercury, Gemini and Apollo programs, and who became NASA's fourth flight director, went on duty moments after the Apollo 13 spacecraft exploded on its way to the moon in 1970. He would play a pivotal role in bringing the three-man crew safely back to Earth.\nHe also led the flight control team when Apollo 11's Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin blasted off from the moon; managed the first joint U.S.-Soviet flight, the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project; and served as the space shuttle program manager in Houston.\nAfter retiring from NASA, he worked for Rockwell International, builder of the space shuttle, and later served as vice president of United Space Alliance, the company that serviced and maintained the shuttle for NASA.\nIn an interview with CBS News on the eve of Apollo 11's 50th anniversary, Lunney talked about President John F. Kennedy's 1961 call for Americans to land astronauts on the moon before the end of the decade. He described the declaration as \"semi-crazy.\"\n\"When we were having a beer talking about that, we didn't think it could be done,\" Lunney said. \"We were working on Mercury, of course, at the time. Mercury was a 2,000-pound ship. And you know, what we had to deal with was getting 200,000 pounds in Earth orbit to get started.\"\nBut, he said, \"people stepped up to it. It was a wonderful thing to see because everybody in the program knew what their job was, and they knew they had to make it work. That happened everywhere. And it was a wonderful thing to see how well Americans did pooling together our resources and our talents and inventing a whole new world of space operations.\"\nA descendent of Cameroonian royalty on his father's side, the Bronx-raised Yaphet Kotto (November 15, 1939-March 15, 2021) brought a charisma and air of gravitas to his film and TV roles. Familiar for playing law enforcement officers in such films as \"Across 110th Street\" and \"Midnight Run\" and the TV series \"Homicide: Life in the Street,\" and for his Emmy-nominated performance as Ugandan dictator Idi Amin in the 1977 TV movie \"Raid on Entebbe,\" Kotto was best remembered for two roles in which he rubbed against authority: the drug dealer Kananga in \"Live and Let Die\"; and Parker, the chief engineer of the ill-fated space tug Nostromo in the 1979 sci-fi/horror classic \"Alien.\"\nIn 2015 Kotto told The Big Issue he tried to avoid playing the part of the Bond villain as a stereotype: \"That was the danger of that role. When I read that script, I said, man, if this is played the wrong way… I had to play Kananga in a way that was so believable you became mesmerized. You see a guy who is completely together – almost as together as James Bond himself.\"\nOf his time shooting \"Alien,\" Kotto recalled the scene in which an alien creature incubating inside John Hurt's chest suddenly makes an appearance. He had a forewarning that something dramatic was planned when the crew showed up wearing head-to-toe protective gear. Of the terror he expressed, he said, \"I would like to take credit for that acting, but I was in shock.\"\nKotto made his stage debut in a Boston production of \"Othello,\" and in 1969 he replaced James Earl Jones on Broadway in the Pulitzer Prize-winning boxing drama \"The Great White Hope.\" His other film roles included \"Nothing But a Man,\" \"The Thomas Crown Affair,\" \"5 Card Stud,\" \"The Liberation of L. B. Jones,\" \"Report to the Commissioner,\" \"Blue Collar,\" \"Brubaker\" \"Othello,\" and \"The Running Man.\"\nBut it was his groundbreaking performance in \"Alien\" – a Black actor with a heroic role in a big-budget science-fiction film – that left the biggest mark for Kotto. At the 2003 Toronto International Film Festival he recalled revisiting the Lincoln Memorial in Washington where he had witnessed Dr. Martin Luther King Jr's \"I have a dream\" speech, when a tour bus of Japanese schoolchildren pulled up. They recognized the actor, shouting \"Alien.\" \"And it was so spooky because I realized that the dream had come true. I was now known throughout the world. The movie opened the door up for women – never before in the history of movies had we seen a heroic woman do what Sigourney [Weaver] did. … It was the first time that an African American had been seen in a role like that. And so today, we see women and African Americans in those heroic roles.\"\nOne of the great middleweights in boxing history, Marvelous Marvin Hagler (May 23, 1954-March 13, 2021) fought on boxing's biggest stages against its biggest names, as he, Sugar Ray Leonard, Thomas Hearns and Roberto Duran dominated the middleweight classes during the 1980s.\nQuiet with a brooding public persona, Hagler fought 67 times over 14 years as a pro out of Brockton, Mass., finishing 62-3-2 with 52 knockouts. He fought with a proverbial chip on his shoulder, convinced that boxing fans and promoters alike didn't give him his proper due. He was so upset that he wasn't introduced before a 1982 fight by his nickname of \"Marvelous\" that he went to court to legally change his name.\n\"If they cut my bald head open, they will find one big boxing glove,\" Hagler once said. \"That's all I am. I live it.\"\nHagler once stopped Hearns in an epic 1985 fight at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas that still lives in boxing lore despite lasting less than eight minutes. Two years later he was so disgusted after losing a decision to Leonard (stolen, he claimed, by the judges) that he never fought again. He moved to Italy to act, and never really looked back.\n\"I feel fortunate to get out of the ring with my faculties and my health,\" he said a year later.\nDuring more than 30 years on network television, starting with CBS in 1961, veteran newsman Roger Mudd (February 9, 1928-March 9, 2021) covered Congress, elections and political conventions and was a frequent anchor and contributor. He shared a George Foster Peabody Award for the 1970 CBS documentary \"The Selling of the Pentagon,\" which looked at the military's public relations efforts during the Vietnam War, and received another Peabody for his November 1979 special \"CBS Reports: Teddy,\" which aired just days before Sen. Ted Kennedy announced his attempt to challenge then-President Carter for the 1980 Democratic presidential nomination.\nIn that report, Mudd asked the Massachusetts senator a simple question: \"Why do you want to be president?\" Kennedy was unable to give a focused answer or specify what he personally wanted to do. As Mudd told viewers: \"On the stump Kennedy can be dominating, imposing and masterful, but off the stump, in personal interviews, he can become stilted, elliptical and at times appear as if he really doesn't want America to get to know him.\"\nMudd frequently substituted for Walter Cronkite on the \"CBS Evening News,\" and anchored the Saturday evening news broadcasts from 1966 to 1973. He then joined NBC News (as a co-anchor of the \"Nightly News\" and \"Meet the Press\"), before working with PBS, on the \"MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour.\" Mudd left the \"NewsHour\" in 1992 to teach journalism at Princeton University, and to serve as a host and correspondent for The History Channel.\nHe wrote a memoir, \"The Place To Be,\" and in an April 2008 \"NewsHour\" interview he said he \"absolutely loved\" keeping tabs on the nation's 100 senators and 435 representatives, \"all of them wanting to talk, great access, politics morning, noon and night, as opposed to the White House, where everything is zipped up and tightly held.\"\nSix decades ago, two housemates in Brooklyn Heights, New York, dreamed up a children's adventure story about a bored boy named Milo, \"who didn't know what to do with himself – not just sometimes, but always.\" The fantastical adventure \"The Phantom Tollbooth,\" overflowing with witty wordplay, became a classic. Author Norton Juster (June 2, 1929-March 8, 2021), joined by his friend, the Pulitzer Prize-winning illustrator Jules Feiffer, told \"Sunday Morning\" correspondent Rita Braver in 2012 that back in 1961 no one expected \"Phantom Tollbooth\" to materialize into anything: \"'The vocabulary's too difficult,'\" Juster recalled the attitude. \"'The ideas were too complex ... Kids would not get any of the word play and punning' ... and to top it all off, 'It's not really a children's book.'\" Or how about: \"'Fantasy is bad for children because it disorients them'?\"\nJuster dreamed up the story while working at an architectural firm, and even after writing \"Phantom Tollbooth\" stuck with architecture and urban planning, co-founding the firm Juster Pope Associates, in Shelburne Falls, Mass., and teaching at Hampshire College. But his stories managed to combine the precision and structure of engineering with his love for the absurd.\n\"The Dot and the Line: A Romance in Mathematics\" is a love triangle involving a straight (and straight-laced) line, a dot, and a squiggle. It was adapted by Chuck Jones into an Oscar-winning animated short. Other books included \"Alberic the Wise and Other Journeys,\" \"Otter Nonsense,\" \"Stark Naked: A Paranomastic Odyssey,\" \"The Hello, Goodbye Window\" (a Caldecott Medal winner for its illustrations), \"Sourpuss and Sweetie Pie,\" and \"The Odious Ogre\" (also illustrated by Feiffer).\nA planned book on urban planning, which was supplanted by his work on \"Phantom Tollbooth,\" never materialized. \"The funny thing is that many of the things I was thinking about for that book did find their way into 'The Phantom Tollbooth,'\" he once wrote. \"Maybe someday I'll get back to it when I'm trying to avoid doing something else.\"\nFrustrated with handling loose spools of recording tape, Dutch engineer Lou Ottens (June 21, 1926-March 6, 2021) tasked his product development team at Philips to develop a contained cartridge for tape that could be recorded and played back without spilling its contents. One directive: the player had to be small enough to fit in a pocket.\nThe result: the compact cassette, whose small size allowed players to be portable. \"It was a breakthrough because it was foolproof,\" Ottens said in an interview for the Philips Museum.\nIntroduced in the early 1960s, cassettes became a worldwide phenomenon, with more than 100 billion sold, both pre-recorded and blank (on which fans could record their own music mixes). Eventually, with Dolby processing, cassettes could beat other music technologies, like 8-track tapes, in fidelity.\nBut its popularity would falter upon the introduction of another technology that Ottens helped develop: the digital compact disc.\nMark Pavelich (February 28, 1958-March 4, 2021) was an All-America selection at the University of Minnesota Duluth before joining the 1980 U.S. Olympic hockey team, whose victory match over the Soviet Union earned the title \"Miracle on Ice.\"\nThe Soviet team, predominantly quasi-professional players, had won four consecutive Olympic Golds, and were heavily favored in their medal round match against what were, comparatively, a bunch of kids – college players and amateurs with an average age of 21. In a pre-Olympic exhibition game, the Soviets trounced the U.S. team 10-3.\nOn February 22, 1980 at the Olympic Center in Lake Placid, N.Y., the Americans held down the Soviets early, and tied the game 2-2 in the last seconds of the first period. The Soviets, having replaced their goalkeeper, kept the Americans scoreless and led 3-2 by the end of the second. Then, on a power play, the Americans tied the game and, with Pavelich's assist, Mike Eruzione shot what would be the winning goal of the 4-3 match.\nThe U.S. team completed its round robin medal play with a victory over Finland to capture the Gold.\nPavelich, a 5-foot-8, 170-pound center, would spend five seasons with the New York Rangers (and later with the Minnesota North Stars and San Jose Sharks), finishing with 137 goals and 192 assists in 355 NHL regular-season games. In a 1983 game against Hartford, Pavelich scored five of the Rangers' 11 goals.\nThough the \"Miracle on Ice\" team won fame, Pavelich balked at celebrity and guarded his privacy. When Eruzione, who became a Rangers broadcaster, asked Pavelich to do an interview for his many fans, he reportedly replied, \"Rizzo, you know that's not important.\"\nThe career of British-born humorist Tony Hendra (July 10, 1941-March 4, 2021) ran the gamut from standup comedian, writer, author and actor to editor of the humor magazines National Lampoon and Spy.\nInitially interested in becoming a monk, Hendra accepted a scholarship to Cambridge University, where he participated in satirical revues by the Footlights theatrical group, performing alongside future Monty Python members John Cleese and Graham Chapman.\nWith his comedy partner Nick Ullett, Hendra opened in New York for Lenny Bruce, and appeared on \"The Ed Sullivan Show.\" After fitful years as a comedy performer and writer, Hendra became a contributor and then managing editor of The National Lampoon. He expanded Lampoon's scope beyond magazine stands to albums and the stage, producing and directing the Off-Broadway revue, \"National Lampoon's Lemmings,\" a parody of Woodstock, which featured future \"Saturday Night Live\" stars John Belushi and Chevy Chase, Alice Playten and Christopher Guest.\nHendra most memorably appeared with Guest in the 1984 mockumentary \"This is Spinal Tap,\" playing the heavy metal band's manager, Ian Faith, who wielded a cricket bat at opportune moments, and who asserted to his touring band members that Boston was \"not a big college town.\"\nIn a 2000 Associated Press interview Hendra said he often did not understand people who would quote dialogue from \"Spinal Tap\" to him, as he didn't remember his own lines – a lot of the script was improvised.\nCivil rights activist, attorney and Washington insider Vernon Jordan (August 15, 1935-March 1, 2021), who grew up in the segregated South, took a strategic view of race issues: \"My view on all this business about race is never to get angry, no, but to get even,\" he told The New York Times in 2000. \"You don't take it out in anger; you take it out in achievement.\"\nAs a young clerk for civil rights attorney Donald Hollowell, Jordan – an imposing 6 feet 4 inches – could be seen in an iconic photo holding back a White mob that was trying to prevent the integration of classes at the University of Georgia.\nJordan served as field secretary for the Georgia office of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. In two years Jordan built new chapters, coordinated demonstrations, and boycotted businesses that would not employ Blacks. After entering private practice, Jordan became director of the Voter Education Project of the Southern Regional Council, registering Black voters and helping elect Black officeholders.\nIn 1970 he became executive director of the United Negro College Fund, raising funds to aid students at historically Black colleges and universities, and soon after became president of the National Urban League (the first lawyer to lead the organization). During his tenure, the Urban League added 17 more chapters, and broadened its focus to include voter registration drives and conflict resolution between Blacks and law enforcement.\nIn May 1980 he survived a murder attempt when a racist shot him in the back with a hunting rifle in Fort Wayne, Ind. Jordan had five surgeries during his months of recovery. \"I'm not afraid, and I won't quit,\" Jordan told Ebony magazine after the shooting.\nHis long friendship with Bill Clinton, which began in Arkansas in the 1970s, landed the Washington lawyer and influencer the position of \"first friend\" when Clinton became president. While turning down the opportunity to become the nation's first Black attorney general after heading the Clinton transition team, Jordan served as an unofficial advisor and confidante – a role that was tarnished during the Monica Lewinsky scandal, when Jordan testified that his efforts to find the former intern a job were not in connection to the White House sex scandal.\nIn a 1978 speech at the National Press Club, Jordan addressed some pundits' suggestions that civil rights advocates – those protesting against the immorality of injustice – ought not raise their voices about other issues (like the environment, tax cuts or national economic policies) that were, supposedly, outside their wheelhouse. \"Civil rights don't take place in a vacuum,\" Jordan said. \"They are meaningful only in the real world – the world where people have to survive to work, to raise their families, to instill in their children hope for the future and the skills to function in a society where a broad back and the desire to work are no longer enough. That is why we are concerned with tax cuts, with energy, with a multitude of issues some White people think are not the concern of Blacks. That is why we see our present efforts as being the logical outcome of those struggles for basic rights of the 1960s. And that is why we insist there is a vital, moral component to the current struggle.\"\nElectronics engineer and Navy veteran Kenneth C. Kelly (1928-Feb. 27, 2021) was awarded more than a dozen patents for innovations in radar and antenna technology in the 1950s. His early work at Hughes Aircraft helped create guided missile systems and the ground satellites that tracked NASA space missions. But in the early 1960s, he could not buy a house in the middle-class suburb of Gardena, Calif., without having a White friend buy it for him before transferring the mortgage, because Blacks were excluded.\nKelly and his wife Loretta later moved near California State University-Northridge, to be closer to his job, and again, the real estate agent wouldn't sell him the lot, so he had to repeat the demeaning experience of having White friends front the purchase.\nKelly would become president of the San Fernando Valley Fair Housing Council, lobbying authorities and going to court to prevent Whites-only advertising. He also became a realtor himself, helping many Black families move into suburbs in the 1970s.\nStill, the engineer who couldn't buy a house on his own fostered advances in antenna designs that contributed to the race to the moon, made satellite TV and radio possible, and helped design robotic antennas for the Mars rovers Spirit and Opportunity. His two-way antenna designs are featured in the massive Mojave Desert radiotelescopes that search for signs of extraterrestrial life. He also formed a society of Black scientists and engineers who launched science fairs and outreach programs to minority students in Los Angeles, which was booming with Black people fleeing the South in the post-war period.\nMore down-to-Earth was his influence on the comic pages, corresponding with \"Peanuts\" cartoonist Charles Schulz to promote the inclusion of a Black character, Franklin, in the strip to promote racial harmony. Kelly urged the cartoonist to treat the Black character as just another member of the Peanuts gang.\nThe same persuasiveness had driven a young Kelly to successfully petition the Navy to allow him to take the engineering exam, despite being told Blacks could only serve as stewards to White officers.\n\"I think I'm a crazy optimist,\" Kelly said in an oral history. \"I'm definitely the half-full glass person. I meet lots of people who are so pessimistic. I always thought I could.\"\nWriter, activist, publisher and bookseller Lawrence Ferlinghetti (March 24, 1919-February 22, 2021) was a San Francisco institution. His influence extended from the beginnings of \"Beat\" poetry as a publisher (he claims to have served as a \"soul mate\" for the movement), to running one of the world's most famous bookstores, City Lights.\nFerlinghetti was himself a poet, playwright, novelist, translator and painter. His 1958 compilation, \"A Coney Island of the Mind,\" sold hundreds of thousands of copies in the U.S. alone. He called his style \"wide open,\" and his work, influenced in part by e.e. cummings, was often lyrical and childlike.\nThis despite the traumas of his childhood, his father dying five months before Ferlinghetti was born, his mother suffering a nervous breakdown two years later, eventually dying in a state hospital. A haunting sense of loss followed him as he spent years moving among relatives, boarding homes and an orphanage, before he was taken in by a wealthy New York family, for whom his mother had worked as a governess. He would study journalism and literature, and served as a Navy commander stationed in Japan in 1945. He recalled witnessing the horrors of Nagasaki following the atomic bomb blast there, which he said made him an \"instant pacifist.\"\nSettling in San Francisco, he helped establish a meeting place for the city's literary movement. Ferlinghetti published Ginsberg's \"Howl and Other Poems\" in 1956, inviting arrest on an obscenity charge. Ferlinghetti won the case in court, and continued releasing works by Jack Kerouac, William S. Burroughs, Lew Welch, Diane di Prima and others.\nIn his 2007 poem \"Poetry as Insurgent Art\" Ferlinghetti called on fellow writers and thinkers to create work capable of answering \"the challenge of apocalyptic times\":\nI am signaling you through the flames. The North Pole is not where it used to be. Manifest Destiny is no longer manifest. Civilization self-destructs. Nemesis is knocking at the door. What are poets for, in such an age? What is the use of poetry? The state of the world calls out for poetry to save it.\nA former Navy sailor, Merchant Marine and self-described \"beach bum,\" Bruce Meyers (March 12, 1926-Feb. 19, 2021) attended art school and built boats, learning to design with fiberglass. In the early 1960s, after watching heavy, \"ugly\" cars try to maneuver sandy beaches, Meyers designed an off-road vehicle that became an icon for California surfers, beach mavens and off-road racers: The dune buggy (pictured). Constructed with a lightweight fiberglass body atop four over-sized wheels, with a pair of googly head lamps and a place to stash a surfboard, the Meyers Manx was an instant hit, and became even more so when Meyers' first dune buggy, dubbed Old Red, won a 1,000-mile off-road race in Mexico in record time.\nMore than 6,000 Meyers Manx dune buggies were built by B.F. Meyers & Co., while a quarter-million copycat dune buggies were built by competitors. According to the Historic Vehicle Association, the Meyers Manx is the most-replicated car ever. In 1976 Road and Track Magazine called the Manx \"one of the most significant and influential cars of all time … recognized as a genuine sculpture, a piece of art.\"\nAfter losing a court case to protect his design, Meyers shut his company in 1971, frustrated with his creation being ripped off, and operated a trading post in Tahiti for many years, before running a car company.\nIn 2019 Meyers described to Automobile magazine an invitation to France in 1994 where he was asked to attend a parade of dune buggies (including many Manx copycats). When he objected, explaining the pain of losing his patent in court, a car expert upbraided him: \"He says, 'You've gotta change focus. You're worried about something that's happened a long time ago and it's killing you. There's a chemical in your body that will make you die sooner: anger. …  Every dune buggy has a couple of smiling faces. You put 'em there. They're yours. Stop thinking about that [other stuff], think about the smiling faces.' …\n\"He shut my mind down, he was so right. I took his other advice and we started the Manx Club … Every dune buggy is a piece of fun, and all the dune buggies, good or bad, they're part of the club – we allowed all copies in. For my enemies are now my friends. Not being pissed at all those people who you were pissed at is the greatest feeling. Unload it. Throw it away. 'Cause it's all in your mind. [Instead I'm] thinking on this happiness that I've caused.\"\nCardiologist Dr. Bernard Lown (June 7, 1921-February 16, 2021) earned renown as creator of the first effective heart defibrillator, a device which applied a jolt of direct-current electricity to a patient experiencing abnormal heart rhythms.\nBut he won a Nobel Prize for Peace in 1985 as co-founder of the group International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War, which protested against the Cold War arms race and the testing of nuclear weapons. He also founded a nonprofit, SatelLife USA, that launched a satellite to improve communications and training of medical personnel in Asia and Africa; and ProCor, an email and web network expanding medical information to developing nations.\nIn 2014 Lown discussed with U.S. News & World Report what he believed contributed to the crisis in medical care: \"In my view the lost art of listening is a quintessential failure of our health care system. I think that you cannot heal the health care system without restoring the art of listening and of compassion. You cannot ignore the patient as a human being. A doctor must be a good listener.\"\nCreated in 1964, Fania Records, which produced albums by such artists as Celia Cruz, Willie Colón, Rubén Blades and Hector Lavoe, became known as \"the Motown of salsa.\" Its co-founder, Johnny Pacheco (March 25, 1935-February 15, 2021), was a Dominican-born bandleader, songwriter and arranger, who led the supergroup Fania All-Stars.\nHis collaborations with Cruz (including their first breakout album, 1974's \"Celia & Johnny,\" which went gold) brought forth a new genre that was international in scope, yet decidedly particular to a nation of immigrants.\nIn 2014 Pacheco talked with WNYC Radio about creating this hybrid form of Latin music: \"When I was rehearsing the band, I saw that we had Dominicans, Cubans, Puerto Ricans, and two Jewish fellows. When you make a sauce, you have different ingredients. And when I saw the band and the singer I thought, this is what we got. We got salsa.\"\nA virtuoso keyboardist, Chick Corea (June 12, 1941-February 9, 2021) pushed the boundaries of numerous musical genres – jazz, fusion, Latin, classical – while working both with acoustic and electronic instruments. A prolific artist, Corea recorded nearly 90 albums, winning 23 Grammy Awards (the most by any jazz artist) and four Latin Grammys.\nBorn just outside Boston, the son of a trumpeter and bandleader, Corea dropped out of both Columbia and Juilliard, and refused to be pigeonholed into any one category, as he told \"Sunday Morning\"'s Billy Taylor back in 1990: \"If I can conceive of something with my imagination, why can't I do it? … Where's the law written that I can't play Latin music, or I can't play blues, or I can't be what I want to be, basically?\"\nCorea performed with Herbie Mann and Stan Getz, before joining the Miles Davis Quintet in 1968. He played on several of the group's albums, including \"In a Silent Way,\" \"Bitches Brew\" and \"On the Corner.\" He then formed the free jazz group Circle, recorded solo albums, and founded the jazz fusion group Return to Forever. A string of bands in various musical styles followed: The Chick Corea Elektric Band, the Chick Corea New Trio, the Five Peace Band, Chick Corea & the Vigil.\nHe was named a National Endowment of the Arts Jazz Master in 2006.\nIn 2020 he talked with Jazz Times about the sense of fulfillment he experienced as a musician and composer as compared to many other professions: \"Most people can't tell how their effort is being received. I can see if I'm bringing people pleasure, if I'm inspiring anybody. When you do that, you're putting something good into the world. I believe that.\"\nA founding member of the Supremes (along with Diana Ross and Florence Ballard), Mary Wilson (March 6, 1944-February 8, 2021) was part of a Motown Records powerhouse, which had a dozen #1 hits during the 1960s. Their elegance, fashion and powerful voices helped define the style of the iconic record label.\n(Pictured: Mary Wilson, center, with Ballard and Ross.)\nThe three singers, who had all grown up in Detroit, were still in their teens when they were signed by Berry Gordy in 1961. Within three years, The Supremes had their first chart-topper, \"Where Did Our Love Go?\" Other hits included \"Baby Love,\" \"Come See About Me,\" \"Stop! In the Name of Love\" and \"Back in My Arms Again.\"\nBallard was replaced by Cindy Birdsong by 1967, and Ross left the group in 1970, leaving Wilson as the sole original member by the time The Supremes broke up for good in 1977. Wilson followed up with two solo albums, and wrote several books, including the bestselling \"Dreamgirl: My Life as a Supreme.\" Her last book, \"Supreme Glamour,\" co-written with Mark Bego, was released in 2019, the same year she competed on the TV series \"Dancing with the Stars.\"\nIn 2019 Wilson told The Guardian, \"We, the Supremes, can't take all the credit. The writers and producers at Motown gave us the music and sound that people loved. And then there was the glamour. My whole life is like a dream. I tell you – if I were not a Supreme, I would want to be a Supreme. I'm living the dream.\"\nGeorge Shultz (December 13, 1920-February 6, 2021) held numerous government positions throughout his long career that spanned academia, business, policy think tanks, and Cabinet posts in Republican administrations. After earning an economics doctorate at MIT, Shultz served as a senior staff economist with President Dwight D. Eisenhower's Council of Economic Advisers. He would later hold the office of dean of the University of Chicago's business school, and was president of the construction and engineering company Bechtel Group from 1975-1982.\nShultz was Labor Secretary, Treasury Secretary and director of the Office of Management and Budget under President Richard M. Nixon, and – for six years – Secretary of State under President Ronald Reagan.\nAfter the October 1983 bombing of the Marine barracks in Beirut that killed 241 soldiers, Shultz worked tirelessly to end Lebanon's brutal civil war in the 1980s. He spent countless hours of shuttle diplomacy between Mideast capitals trying to secure the withdrawal of Israeli forces there.\nThe experience led him to believe that stability in the region could only be assured with a settlement to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and he set about on an ambitious but ultimately unsuccessful mission to bring the parties to the negotiating table, shaping the path for future administrations' Mideast efforts by legitimizing the Palestinians as a people with valid aspirations and a valid stake in determining their future.\nShultz also negotiated the first-ever treaty to reduce the size of the Soviet Union's ground-based nuclear arsenals despite fierce objections from Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev to Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative. The 1987 Intermediate Range Nuclear Forces Treaty was a historic attempt to begin to reverse the nuclear arms race.\nA rare public disagreement between Reagan and Shultz came in 1985 when the president ordered thousands of government employees with access to highly classified information to take a \"lie detector\" test as a way to plug leaks of information. Shultz told reporters, \"The minute in this government that I am not trusted is the day that I leave.\" The administration soon backed off the demand.\nShultz retained an iconoclastic streak, speaking out against several mainstream Republican policy positions. He created some controversy by calling the war on recreational drugs, championed by Reagan, a failure, and raised eyebrows by decrying the longstanding U.S. embargo on Cuba as \"insane.\" Since his retirement, Shultz advocated for an increased focus on climate change.\nFollowing last November's presidential election, Shultz wrote in a Washington Post op-ed, \"Dec. 13 marks my turning 100 years young. I've learned much over that time, but looking back, I'm struck that there is one lesson I learned early and then relearned over and over: Trust is the coin of the realm. When trust was in the room, whatever room that was — the family room, the schoolroom, the locker room, the office room, the government room or the military room — good things happened. When trust was not in the room, good things did not happen. Everything else is details.\"\nCanadian actor Christopher Plummer (December 13, 1929-February 5, 2021), the great grandson of a former prime minister, caught the acting bug early, and earned praise for his stage roles while still in his teens. He made his film debut in 1958's \"Stage Struck,\" appeared in a TV adaptation of \"A Doll's House,\" and played the emperor Commodus in \"The Fall of the Roman Empire,\" before taking on what would be his signature movie role: Captain Von Trapp in \"The Sound of Music.\"\nThe picture's success launched him into film stardom, with roles in \"Inside Daisy Clover,\" \"The Night of the Generals,\" \"Battle of Britain,\" \"Waterloo,\" \"The Return of the Pink Panther,\" \"The Man Who Would Be King,\" \"The Silent Partner,\" \"Murder by Decree,\" \"Eyewitness,\" \"Malcolm X,\" \"Twelve Monkeys,\" and \"Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country\" (as a Shakespeare-quoting Klingon).\nBut for years his career remained focused on the stage, performing in \"Henry V,\" \"Julius Caesar,\" \"Hamlet,\" \"Twelfth Night,\" \"Macbeth\" and \"Becket.\" He won a Tony Award in 1974 as Cyrano de Bergerac, and another in 1997 playing John Barrymore. His other Broadway appearances include \"J.B.,\" \"The Good Doctor,\" Iago in \"Othello,\" \"King Lear,\" \"No Man's Land\" and \"Inherit the Wind.\"\nHe saw a resurgence in film work beginning in 1999 with his portrayal of \"60 Minutes\" journalist Mike Wallace in \"The Insider,\" followed by a psychiatrist in \"A Beautiful Mind,\" a mystic in \"The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus,\" a colonist in \"The New World,\" Leo Tolstoy in \"The Last Station,\" the voice of an explorer in the Pixar film \"Up,\" and a family patriarch in \"The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo.\" In \"Beginners\" he played a man who, at 75, comes out as gay. His performance earned him an Oscar, making him, at 82, the oldest Academy Award-winning actor ever.\n\"In many ways it feels like you're kind of in the prime of your movie career,\" correspondent Anthony Mason told Plummer in 2011, in an interview for \"Sunday Morning.\"\n\"Yes, it's extraordinary to wait this long,\" he replied. \"I've worked harder and more frequently now that I'm in my eighties than I ever did before.\"\nHe was not just in demand, but extraordinarily nimble. In 2017, when accusations of sexual predation led to the cutting of Kevin Spacey from the film \"All the Money in the World,\" Plummer stepped into the role of J. Paul Getty, with just one month before the movie's L.A. premiere. Director Ridley Scott spent nine days reshooting all of Spacey's scenes with Plummer, who wound up earning his third Oscar nomination. And in 2019 he starred in the comic thriller \"Knives Out.\"\nIn 1978 Leon Spinks (July 11, 1953 – February 5, 2021), a gold medalist from the 1976 Olympic Games and a former Marine, was an unranked boxer who'd only had seven professional fights when he faced off against Muhammad Ali, who'd picked Spinks as an easy opponent. Promoter Bob Arum told the Guardian that he thought Spinks was out-matched. But Spinks shocked the boxing world by beating Ali by split decision in a 15-round fight, winning the heavyweight boxing title at age 25.\n\"I'm not The Greatest,\" Spinks said afterward. \"Just the latest.\"\nIn a rematch seven months later, before a record indoor boxing crowd of 72,000 at New Orleans' Superdome and a national TV audience of an estimated 90 million, Ali regained the title.\nSpinks, with a big grin that often showed off his missing front teeth, was popular among boxing fans for both his win over Ali and his easygoing personality, and he continued fighting into the mid-1990s, ending his career with a 26-17-3 record. But he burned through his earnings quickly, and at one point after retiring was working as a custodian, cleaning locker rooms at a Nebraska YMCA.\nHe later was part of a group of ex-fighters who had their brains studied by the Cleveland Clinic Lou Ruvo Center for Brain Health in Las Vegas. Spinks was found to have brain damage caused by a combination of taking punches to the head and heavy drinking, though he functioned well enough to do autograph sessions and other events late in his life.\n\"He was happy-go-lucky, the salt of the earth,\" Arum said. \"Leon was nutty but you couldn't get angry at the guy. He never meant any harm to anyone.\"\nIn 1968 Rennie Davis (May 23, 1940-February 2, 2021), a longtime peace activist, was a national director for the anti-war group Students for a Democratic Society, coordinating protests to be held at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago. He was among the 3,000 demonstrators who faced off against police and Illinois National Guardsmen in a bloody confrontation that an investigation later described as a \"police riot.\"\nBeaten on the head by cops, Davis (pictured here center, with Abbie Hoffman and Jerry Rubin) was taken to a hospital to get 13 stitches. He told \"Sunday Morning\" correspondent Tracy Smith in 2020 that he was hidden by medical staff: \"The police realized that I was in the hospital because they knew I had been clubbed. And so, they started a search of the hospital, room by room by room. And most of the nurses – they could end their careers by what they did – they put me on a trolley cart and covered me with a sheet and moved me from room to room, to hide [me] from the police.\"\nUltimately, during the \"Chicago Seven\" trial in 1969-70, Davis and four co-defendants (Rubin, Hoffman, Tom Hayden and David Dellinger) were convicted of conspiracy to incite a riot, convictions that were late overturned by a federal appeals court.\nBy the early 1970s Davis became disillusioned with the more violent course the anti-war movement had taken. He moved to Colorado, where he studied and taught spirituality and entered the business world, selling life insurance and running a think tank that developed technologies for the environment. He became both a venture capitalist and a lecturer on meditation and self-awareness.\nWhen she was five years old, Millie Hughes-Fulford (December 21, 1945-February 2, 2021) was watching \"Buck Rogers\" and decided she wanted to be Wilma Deering, a female astronaut who piloted a spaceship while wearing pants. \"It was a life's dream, and not many of us get our life's dream,\" she said in an interview with the Department of Veterans Affairs in 2014.\nStudying biology and plasma chemistry, Dr. Hughes-Fulford, a U.S. Army Medical Corps Major, was chosen by NASA to become the first female scientist to fly aboard Spacelab in 1991. After spending nine days in orbit, she participated in a week-long study of how the body readjusts to gravity. She also oversaw space experiments in the late '90s investigating the causes of osteoporosis occurring in astronauts during space flights.\nHughes-Fulford later lobbied for the International Space Station, and worked on experiments in space that studied T-cell dysfunction in microgravity. A molecular biologist at the VA medical center in San Francisco, she became director of the laboratory that bears her name.\nLast year as health care workers began battling the COVID pandemic, World War II veteran and former motorcycle racer Capt. Tom Moore (April 30, 1920-February 2, 2021) set out to raise £1,000 for Britain's National Health Service by walking 100 laps in his backyard – this as he turned 100 years old. For three weeks in April, daily videos showed Captain Tom, stooped with age, doggedly pushing his walker in the garden, maintaining a sunny attitude in the middle of a pandemic lockdown.\n\"Please always remember, tomorrow will be a good day,\" Moore said in an interview – words that became his trademark.\nCaptain Tom became a viral sensation, and a true inspiration, with donations pouring in from across the U.K. and around the world, raising about £33 million ($40 million). When he finished his 100th lap on April 16, a military honor guard lined the path. World War II-era fighter planes flew overhead in tribute on his birthday.\n\"I felt a little frustrated and disappointed after I broke my hip and it knocked my confidence,\" he said after completing his trek. \"However, the past three weeks have put a spring back in my step. I have renewed purpose and have thoroughly enjoyed every second of this exciting adventure.\"\nHe was made an honorary member of the England cricket team, had a train named after him, and in July, while wearing his wartime medals, Moore was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II, in a socially-distanced ceremony at Windsor Castle.\n\"I have been overwhelmed by the many honors I have received over the past weeks, but there is simply nothing that can compare to this,\" he tweeted after the ceremony. \"I am overwhelmed with pride and joy.\"\nHe dedicated his autobiography, \"Tomorrow Will Be a Good Day,\" to \"all those who serve on the front line of any battle – be it military, psychological or medical.\"\nActor Dustin Diamond (January 7, 1977-February 1, 2021) was best known for playing the nerdy character of Screech on the sitcom \"Saved By the Bell,\" and its related shows, including \"Good Morning, Miss Bliss,\" \"Saved by the Bell: The College Years,\" and \"Saved by the Bell: The New Class.\"\nHis other credits included \"Big Top Pee-wee,\" \"The Wonder Years,\" \"Celebrity Fit Club,\" \"The Weakest Link,\" \"Celebrity Boxing 2,\" and \"Celebrity Big Brother.\"\nActress Cicely Tyson (December 19, 1924-January 28, 2021) grew up in Harlem with a very religious mother who thought the world of modeling and acting was a den of iniquity – so much so she kicked Cicely out of the house after her daughter landed her first role. \"My mother didn't talk to me for two years,\" Tyson told \"Sunday Morning\" correspondent Lee Cowan in 2013. Though the impasse was hard, she said, \"I also knew that what I was feeling was so compelling that nothing was going to stop me.\"\nAnd nothing did. As an actress she became a beacon of social conscience, rarely taking on roles unless she felt they contributed to the national dialogue on civil rights. \"I wanted to address certain issues, and I chose to use my career as my platform,\" Tyson said.\nHer performance as the wife of a Southern sharecropper in \"Sounder\" (1972) earned her an Oscar nomination for Best Actress. And in the landmark TV miniseries \"Roots,\" she played Kunta Kinte's mother. When asked to describe the impact \"Roots\" had, she replied, \"Wow. I don't even know if I could verbalize it. It is the one thing I believe that has touched every single culture or race.\"\nTyson's most indelible role was in the TV film, \"The Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman,\" playing a former slave who lived to the age of 110 – old enough to take a stand in the civil rights movement. The performance won her two Emmy Awards in 1974.\nOther film appearances include \"Odds Against Tomorrow,\" \"The Last Angry Man,\" \"The Comedians,\" \"A Man Called Adam,\" \"The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter,\" \"The Blue Bird,\" \"The River Niger,\" \"A Hero Ain't Nothin' But a Sandwich,\" \"Bustin' Loose,\" \"Fried Green Tomatoes,\" \"The Grass Harp,\" \"The Help,\" and \"Diary of a Mad Black Woman.\"\nOn TV she appeared in \"East Side, West Side,\"  \"King,\" \"The Rosa Parks Story,\" \"Wilma,\" \"A Woman Called Moses\" (as Harriet Tubman), \"The Marva Collins Story,\" \"Sweet Justice,\" \"A Lesson Before Dying,\" \"House of Cards,\" \"Cherish the Day,\" and \"How to Get Away With Murder.\" She earned a Best Supporting Actress Emmy for \"Oldest Living Confederate Widow Tells All.\"\nShe would become the oldest Tony-winner for Best Actress, at age 88, for the 2013 revival of Horton Foote's \"The Trip to Bountiful.\" She returned to Broadway in 2015 for a revival of \"The Gin Game,\" co-starring James Earl Jones. She also taught master classes in acting at the Cicely L. Tyson Community School of Performing and Fine Arts in East Orange, N.J.\nTyson received a Kennedy Center Honor in 2015, the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2016, and an honorary Oscar in 2018.\nWhen asked if she believes she has made a difference, Tyson said, \"I hope I have. I hope so. I'm told so every day. And that's very rewarding. It's very satisfying.\"\nActress Cloris Leachman (April 30, 1926-January 27, 2021) initially made her mark in drama, and won an Oscar for her mesmerizing portrayal of a lonely, adulterous housewife in \"The Last Picture Show\" (1971), a role she would repeat in the 1990 sequel, \"Texasville.\"\nHer early credits include \"Kiss Me Deadly,\" \"The Rack,\" \"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid,\" \"Lovers and Other Strangers,\" \"WUSA,\" and such TV series as \"Actors Studio,\" \"Suspense,\" \"Lassie\" (playing Timmy's mother), \"Alfred Hitchcock Presents,\" \"One Step Beyond,\" \"The Twilight Zone,\" \"The Untouchables,\" \"77 Sunset Strip,\" \"Dr. Kildare,\" and \"The Virginian.\"\nBut her power and versatility as a dramatic actress would become overshadowed by her unparalleled comedic chops, first on television and then in the movies of Mel Brooks.\nLeachman won two of her nine Emmy Awards playing Mary Tyler Moore's neighbor, Phyllis Lindstrom, on \"The Mary Tyler Moore Show,\" and would go on to headline her own spin-off TV series. Then, in Brooks' 1974 classic \"Young Frankenstein,\" she played Frau Blücher, whose very name would cause horses to whinny in terror.\nWhen \"Sunday Morning\" correspondent Tracy Smith asked Leachman in 2015 the story behind the horses, Leachman said, \"I asked Mel a few years ago, and he said, 'Blucher means glue.'\"\nShe returned to work with Brooks in \"High Anxiety,\" as a villainous nurse in a mental institution, and in \"History of the World: Part I.\" Other films and TV credits include \"Crazy Mama,\" \"Daisy Miller,\" \"Promised Land,\" \"The Facts of Life,\" \"The Ellen Show,\" \"Touched by an Angel,\" \"Raising Hope,\" \"Dancing With the Stars,\" \"Malcolm in the Middle\" (for which she won two Emmys), \"Mad About You,\" and the animated \"The Croods.\"\nShe continued working up to the very end. In 2016, the then-90-year-old was asked by The Hollywood Reporter if she ever thought of retiring. Her reply? \"F***.\"\nBroadcaster Larry King (November 19, 1933-January 23, 2021) conducted nearly 60,000 interviews during the course of his six-decade radio and TV career, asking questions of the famous and infamous. Describing his style to \"60 Minutes,\" King fell back onto his Brooklyn roots as someone who was \"No baloney … I'm a guy who asks questions, that's all. I'm a guy who's curious.\"\nBorn Lawrence Zeiger, the son of Jewish immigrants, he moved in 1957 to Florida, where he'd heard broadcasting jobs were available. Sweeping floors at a small radio station in Miami, he was put on the air when the DJ suddenly quit, and was given a new name by the station manager who decided Zeiger was \"too Jewish\" sounding. King bounced around to other radio stations during the '60s, and acquired a newspaper column. But financial setbacks and a lawsuit pushed him off the air for several years, until the late '70s, when he began hosting radio's first nationwide call-in show on the Mutual Network. \"The Larry King Show\" would expand to more than 300 stations. When he joined CNN in 1985, his nightly conversations on \"Larry King Live\" became a staple of the cable TV medium (as did his trademark suspenders).\nKing had a penchant both for inviting newsmakers and making news. In 1992 Texas businessman Ross Perot was coaxed by King to announce on his show he'd consider running for president. King's 1994 interview with Marlon Brando grabbed headlines, as much for the fact that the reclusive movie star actually gave an interview as for the kiss he planted on King's lips.\nHe said that he did not adhere to prepared questions but primarily listened to what his subjects said, and jumped off from there, creating a conversational and friendly atmosphere that attracted politicians and dictators, musicians and movie stars, murderers and crime victims (and earned King two Peabody Awards). And the friendly tone invited humor, such as when the Dalai Lama complimented King on one of the broadcaster's many wives: \"Looks like your daughter!\" he laughed.\nIn 1992 the curious King told \"60 Minutes\" correspondent Mike Wallace that his only worry was dying.\n\"What are you worried about? You're a boy!\" Wallace said to the then-59-year-old.\n\"This universe has been around a long time, it's going to be around for a long time, and I'm here for a blip of it,\" King said, \"and I want to see it all.\"\nBaseball's one-time home run king, Hank Aaron (February 5, 1934-January 22, 2021), endured virulent racism as he chased Babe Ruth's home run record of 714, long held to be an insurmountable target. Aaron became a target himself, of hate mail and racist threats, forcing the Atlanta Brave to have bodyguard protection. He kept the hateful letters, he said, as a reminder of the abuse he bore.\nNevertheless, Aaron matched Ruth's record on April 4, 1974, and topped it with homer no. 715 four days later before a sold-out Atlanta Stadium and a nationwide TV audience. (The unlucky pitcher: Al Downing of the Los Angeles Dodgers.)\nHome runs were only part of his game. Aaron remains baseball's all-time RBI leader (with 2,297) and leader in total bases (6,856). He ranks second in at-bats (12,354); third in games played (3,298) and hits (3,771); fourth in runs scored (tied with Ruth at 2,174); and 13th in doubles (624).\nHe won two National League batting titles, was a three-time Gold Glove winner, and recorded more than 20 stolen bases in seven seasons. His sole National League MVP Award came in 1957, when the Braves beat the New York Yankees to win the World Series (the only championship of Aaron's career).\nAfter 21 years with the Braves, he ended his career with two years back in Milwaukee, as a designated hitter for the Brewers. (He was traded after refusing to take a front-office job with a significant pay cut.) He added 22 homers to his lifetime total, finishing with 755, a record that would stand for 33 years (until Barry Bonds, of the San Francisco Giants, surpassed it).\n\"I just tried to play the game the way it was supposed to be played,\" Aaron once said.\nAfter his retirement in 1976, the Hall of Famer's status as one of the game's all-time greats, and as a civil rights hero, philanthropist, supporter of the NAACP, and an advocate for increased diversity among major league baseball's coaching staffs, would lead boxer Muhammad Ali to describe Aaron as \"the only man I idolize more than myself.\"\nHall of Fame manager Tommy Lasorda (September 22, 1927-January 7, 2021) bled Dodger blue for more than seven decades as part of the Los Angeles baseball team's organization. Earning notice in the minors as a strikeout hurler (once recording 25 KOs in a 15-inning game), he was brought up to the majors in 1954. But in his first start, in 1955, he threw three wild pitches against the Cardinals and was called from the mound after the first inning. During three seasons in the majors (with the Brooklyn Dodgers and the Kansas City Athletics) he achieved a 0-4 record with a 6.48 ERA and 37 strikeouts.\nLasorda then became a scout and coach and, later, the Dodgers' manager for 21 years. During that time, his gregarious leadership skills helped the team to two World Series championships (in 1981 and 1988), in addition to four National League titles and eight division titles. He also managed the U.S. Olympic team to a gold medal at the 2000 Sydney Games.\nHe was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1997.\nJust as evident as Lasorda's enthusiasm for the game was his waistline: \"When we won games, I'd eat to celebrate,\" he once explained. \"And when we lost games, I'd eat to forget.\"\nIn 1964 British filmmaker Michael Apted (February 10, 1941-January 7, 2021) was a 22-year-old researcher working on a documentary for U.K. television. His assignment: find a cohort of seven-year-old schoolchildren from across socio-economic lines for a film about London youth, inspired by the adage, \"Give me the child until he is seven, and I will show you the man.\" \"Seven Up!\" was a success, capturing the hopes and dreams of young Britons, affluent and poor, Black and White. Apted subsequently directed follow-up visits to the same schoolchildren, filmed at seven-year intervals, beginning with \"14 Up\" and \"21 Up,\" all the way through \"63 Up,\" released in 2019. For Apted, the series became his life's work – a living document of humanity probing the joys and sadness of growing up.\nIn 2013 \"Sunday Morning\" correspondent Lee Cowan asked Apted what made the Peabody Award-winning series so compelling. \"Well, 'cause I think people identify with it,\" Apted replied. \"You see 13, 14 stories up there, and there's elements in some of them that hit home on every life. Everybody who watches it can identify with something.\"\nIn addition to capturing real life, Apted also directed biopics (\"Coal Miner's Daughter,\" \"Gorillas of the Mist\"), comedies (\"Continental Divide\"), dramas (\"Agatha,\" \"Thunderheart,\" \"Nell,\" \"Enigma\")  thrillers (\"Gorky Park,\" \"Blink\"), fantasy (\"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Voyage of the Dawn Treader\"), concert films (Sting's \"Bring on the Night\"), and even a James Bond movie (\"The World Is Not Enough\").\nApted said he hoped to keep the \"Up\" series going as long as his interviewees were willing and healthy. (\"63 Up\" included the passing of one subject, Lynn.) His goal: to keep it going until his film family are in their 80s – which would put Apted at nearly 100: \"I figured out when I do '84,' I'll be 99. So, that could be a nice swan song, shouldn't it?\" he laughed.\nA war correspondent for United Press International and The New York Times in the early years of the Vietnam War, Neil Sheehan (October 27, 1936-January 7, 2021) was a national correspondent for the Times based in Washington when he obtained from Daniel Ellsberg, a former consultant to the Defense Department, a history of U.S. involvement in Vietnam. Sheehan broke the story of the Pentagon Papers in his articles for the Times, beginning in June 1971, which exposed widespread government deception, by political and military leaders, about U.S. prospects for victory. The Washington Post soon followed with reporting of its own.\nIn an interview published posthumously in the Times (Sheehan had asked that it not be printed until after his death), the writer revealed that Ellsberg did not give him the Pentagon Papers (as was widely believed), but that Sheehan had deceived his source and taken them. Admitting he was \"really quite angry\" by what the papers revealed, Sheehan decided that \"this material is never again going in a government safe.\" He smuggled the documents from the Massachusetts apartment where they had been kept, and copied thousands of pages to take to the Times.\n\"You had to do what I did,\" Sheehan said. \"I had decided, 'This guy is just impossible. You can't leave it in his hands. It's too important and it's too dangerous.'\".\nThe Nixon administration sought a restraining order against publication, argued on national security grounds. But on June 30, 1971, the Supreme Court ruled 6-3 in favor of allowing the Times and the Post to continue revealing the Pentagon Papers' contents. The coverage won the Times the Pulitzer Prize for public service.\nThe Nixon administration tried to discredit Ellsberg after the documents' release, including orchestrating a break-in at the office of Ellsberg's Beverly Hills psychiatrist to find information with which to discredit him. When evidence of the break-in and government wiretaps surfaced, Ellsberg's trial for theft, conspiracy and violations of the Espionage Act ended in a mistrial.\nWhen Ellsberg bumped into Sheehan and accused Sheehan of stealing the papers, the journalist replied, \"'No, Dan, I didn't steal it. And neither did you. Those papers are the property of the people of the United States. They paid for them with their national treasure and the blood of their sons, and they have a right to it.'\"\nSheehan's 1988 account of the war, \"A Bright Shining Lie: John Paul Vann and America in Vietnam,\" won him the Pulitzer Prize and National Book Award. He also authored \"After the War Was Over: Hanoi and Saigon.\" In a 1988 C-SPAN interview Sheehan said, \"Vietnam will be a war in vain only if we don't draw wisdom from it.\"\nBronx, N.Y. native Tanya Roberts (October 15, 1955-January 4, 2021) studied acting under Lee Strasberg and Uta Hagen, but her earliest jobs were in modeling and commercials that highlighted her beauty. Even her first big break, replacing Shelley Hack on the TV series \"Charlie's Angels,\" was more glamorous than substantive.\nRoberts would star in the films \"The Beastmaster,\" \"Sheena: Queen of the Jungle\" and \"Hearts and Armour,\" before being picked to star opposite Roger Moore in his last appearance as James Bond, in 1985′s \"A View to a Kill.\"\nIn a 2015 interview with London's Daily Mail, Roberts admitted that she was cautious about accepting the role in a Bond film: \"I remember I said to my agent, 'No one ever works after they get a Bond movie,' and they said to me, 'Are you kidding? Glenn Close would do it if she could.'\"\nAfter \"A View to a Kill,\" Roberts made few film appearances. Her most notable role was in the sitcom \"That '70s Show\" as Laura Prepon's hippie mother, Midge, who embraced the women's liberation movement.\n\"I've made a lot of good choices and a lot of bad choices and that's part of life,\" Roberts told the Daily Mail. \"Whether you're really successful or moderately successful … You can't go through life defeated. It's just trial-and-error.\"\nBestselling novelist Eric Jerome Dickey (July 7, 1961-January 3, 2021) was a software developer and aspiring actor and stand-up comic when he began writing fiction in his mid-30s. His first book, \"Sister, Sister,\" was celebrated for its depiction of Black sisterhood.\nHis witty and conversational prose style punctuated such novels as \"Friends and Lovers,\" \"Milk in My Coffee,\" \"Cheaters,\" \" Liar's Game,\" \"Thieves' Paradise,\" \"The Other Woman\" and \"Genevieve,\" and the \"Gideon\" crime fiction series, which included \"Sleeping With Strangers\" and \"Resurrecting Midnight.\" Dickey wrote 29 novels in all, with more than seven million copies in print worldwide. His final novel, \"The Son of Mr. Suleman,\" is due in April.\nHe also contributed to anthologies such as \"Mothers and Sons\" and \"Black Silk: A Collection of African American Erotica,\" and wrote a comic book miniseries for Marvel featuring the characters Storm and Black Panther.\nIn 2016 he talked with the Washington Independent Review of Books about how he \"reinvented\" himself by attending UCLA: \"Studied, studied, studied, read, read, read, wrote, wrote, still rewriting what I wrote, wrote, wrote. At UCLA, I started with all the 101 classes, learned what I could from the ground up. My best approach to anything, no matter my level of experience or education, has always been with an empty cup. You never know everything.\"\nDavid Morgan is a senior editor at CBSNews.com and cbssundaymorning.com.\nFirst published on January 22, 2021 / 1:58 PM\nCopyright © 2021 CBS Interactive Inc.

            "report_content": "Governor of Ohio\nU.S. Congressman\nJohn Richard Kasich Jr. (/ˈkeɪsɪk/ KAY-sik;[1] born May 13, 1952)[2] is an American politician, author, and television news host who served in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1983 to 2001 and as the 69th Governor of Ohio from 2011 to 2019. A Republican, Kasich unsuccessfully sought his party's presidential nomination in 2000 and 2016.[3]\nKasich grew up in McKees Rocks, Pennsylvania, moving to Ohio to attend college. After a single term in the Ohio Senate, he served nine terms as a member of the United States House of Representatives from Ohio's 12th congressional district.[4] His tenure in the House included 18 years on the House Armed Services Committee and six years as chairman of the House Budget Committee. Kasich was a key figure in the passage of both 1996 welfare reform legislation and the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. Kasich decided not to run for re-election in 2000 and ran for president instead. He withdrew from the race before the Republican primaries.\nAfter leaving Congress, Kasich hosted Heartland with John Kasich on Fox News from 2001 to 2007 and served as managing director of the Lehman Brothers office in Columbus, Ohio.[5][6] He ran for governor of Ohio in 2010, defeating Democratic incumbent Ted Strickland.[7] He was re-elected in 2014, defeating Democratic challenger Ed FitzGerald by 30 percentage points. Kasich was term-limited and could not seek a third gubernatorial term in 2018; he was succeeded by fellow Republican Mike DeWine.\nKasich ran for president again in 2016, finishing in third place in the Republican primaries behind Donald Trump and Ted Cruz. He won the primary in his home state of Ohio and finished second in New Hampshire. Kasich declined to support Trump as the Republican presidential nominee and did not attend the 2016 Republican National Convention, which was held in Ohio.[8][9] In 2019, following the end of his second term as governor, Kasich joined CNN as a contributor. Kasich is known as one of Trump's most prominent critics within the Republican Party,[10] and he endorsed Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden for president in a speech at the 2020 Democratic National Convention.[11]\nJohn Richard Kasich Jr. was born and raised in the Pittsburgh suburb of McKees Rocks, Pennsylvania.[13] He is the son of Anne (née Vukovich; 1918–1987) and John Richard Kasich (1919-1987), who worked as a mail carrier.[14][15]\nKasich's father was of Czech descent, while his mother was of Croatian descent.[16] Both his father and mother were children of immigrants and were practicing Roman Catholics.[14] He has described himself as \"a Croatian and a Czech\".[17]\nAfter attending public schools in his hometown of McKees Rocks, Kasich later left his native Pennsylvania, settling in  Columbus, Ohio in 1970 to attend The Ohio State University, where he joined the Alpha Sigma Phi fraternity.[18]\nAs a freshman, he wrote a letter to President Richard Nixon describing concerns he had about the nation and requesting a meeting with the President. The letter was delivered to Nixon by the university's president Novice Fawcett and Kasich was granted a 20-minute meeting with Nixon in December 1970.[19][20]\nEarning a Bachelor of Arts degree in political science from The Ohio State University, in 1974,[21] he went on to work as a researcher for the Ohio Legislative Service Commission.[22] From 1975 to 1978, he served as an administrative assistant to then-state Senator Buz Lukens.[23]\nIn 1978, Kasich ran against Democratic incumbent Robert O'Shaughnessy for State Senate. A political ally of Kasich remembers him during that time as a persistent campaigner: \"People said, 'If you just quit calling me, I'll support you.'\"[24]  At age 26, Kasich won with 56% of the vote, beginning his four-year term representing the 15th district.[25] Kasich was the second youngest person ever elected to the Ohio Senate.[26]\nOne of his first acts as a State Senator was to refuse a pay raise.[27][28] Republicans gained control of the State Senate in 1980, but Kasich went his own way, for example, by opposing a budget proposal he believed would raise taxes and writing his own proposal instead.[24]\nIn 1982, Kasich ran for Congress in Ohio's 12th congressional district, which included portions of Columbus as well as the cities of Westerville, Reynoldsburg,  Worthington, and Dublin. He won the Republican primary with 83% of the vote[29] and defeated incumbent Democratic U.S. Congressman Bob Shamansky in the general election by a margin of 50%–47%.[30] He would never face another contest nearly that close, and was re-elected eight more times with at least 64 percent of the vote.[31][32]\nDuring his congressional career, Kasich was considered a fiscal conservative, taking aim at programs supported by Republicans and Democrats. He worked with Ralph Nader in seeking to reduce corporate tax loopholes.[33][34]\nKasich was a member of the House Armed Services Committee for 18 years.[35] He developed a \"fairly hawkish\" reputation on that committee,[36] although he \"also zealously challenged\" defense spending he considered wasteful.[35][37] Among the Pentagon projects that he targeted were the B-2 bomber program (teaming up with Democratic representative Ron Dellums to cut the program, their efforts were partly successful)[33][38] and the A-12 bomber program (ultimately canceled by defense secretary Dick Cheney in 1991).[37] He participated extensively in the passage of the Goldwater–Nichols Act of 1986, which reorganized the U.S. Department of Defense.[37][39] He also pushed through the bill creating the 1988 Base Realignment and Closure Commission, which closed obsolete U.S. military bases, and successfully opposed a proposed $110 million expansion of the Pentagon building after the end of the Cold War.[37] He also \"proposed a national commission on arms control\" and \"urged tighter controls over substances that could be used for biological warfare.\"[37]\nKasich said he was \"100 percent for\" the first Persian Gulf War as well as the 2001 invasion of Afghanistan, but said that he did not favor U.S. military participation in the Lebanese Civil War or in Bosnia.[40] In 1997, with fellow Republican representative Floyd Spence, he introduced legislation (supported by some congressional Democrats) for the U.S. to pull out of a multilateral peacekeeping force in Bosnia.[41] In the House, he supported the Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act, a U.S. Representative Ron Dellums (D- CA)-led initiative to impose economic sanctions against apartheid-era South Africa.[37]\nIn 1993, Kasich became the ranking Republican member of the House Budget Committee. Kasich and other House Budget Committee Republicans proposed an alternative to President Bill Clinton's deficit reduction bill, the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993.[42] That proposal included funds to implement Republican proposals for health care, welfare, and crime control legislation and for a child tax credit.[42] The Penny-Kasich Plan, named after Kasich and fellow lead sponsor Tim Penny, was supported by Republicans and conservative Democrats.[43] It proposed $90 billion in spending cuts over five years, almost three times as much in cuts as the $37 billion in cuts backed by the Clinton administration and Democratic congressional leaders.[43] About one-third ($27 billion) of the proposed Penny-Kasich cuts would come from means-testing Medicare, specifically by reducing Medicare payments to seniors who earned $75,000 or more in adjusted gross income.[44][45] This angered the AARP, which lobbied against the legislation.[44] Another $26 billion of the Penny-Kasich plan's cuts would have come from the U.S. Department of Defense and foreign aid, which led Secretary of Defense Les Aspin to say that the plan would destroy military morale.[44] Another $27 billion in savings would have come from federal layoffs.[44] The proposal was narrowly defeated in the House by a 219–213 vote.[43][44]\nAs ranking member of the Budget Committee, Kasich proposed his own health care reform plan as a rival to the Clinton health care plan of 1993 championed by First Lady Hillary Clinton, but more market-based.[46] As journalist Zeke Miller wrote in Time magazine, \"The Kasich plan would have covered all Americans by 2005, using a form of an individual mandate that would have required employees to purchase insurance through their employers. (The mandate was an idea initially supported by conservative groups like The Heritage Foundation.)\"[46]\nOn November 17, 1993, Kasich voted to approve the North American Free Trade Agreement, casting a \"yea\" vote for the North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act.[47]\nIn 1994, Kasich was one of the Republican leaders to support a last-minute deal with President Bill Clinton to pass the Federal Assault Weapons Ban. After a series of meetings with Clinton's Chief of Staff, Leon Panetta, a longtime friend of Kasich, the assault weapons ban was passed when 42 Republicans crossed party lines and voted to ban assault weapons with the Democrats.[48] His support of the assault-weapons ban angered the National Rifle Association, which gave Kasich an \"F\" rating in 1994 as a result.[49]\nIn 1995, when Republicans gained the majority in the United States Congress following the 1994 election, Kasich became chair of the House Budget Committee. In 1996, he introduced the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act in the House, an important welfare reform bill signed into law by President Clinton.[50]\nDuring the 1996 presidential campaign, Republican nominee Bob Dole was reported to have considered Kasich as a vice presidential running mate but instead selected Jack Kemp, a former congressman and Secretary of Housing and Urban Development.[51]\nIn 1997, Kasich rose to national prominence after becoming \"the chief architect of a deal that balanced the federal budget for the first time since 1969\"—the Balanced Budget Act of 1997.[52]\nIn 1998, Kasich voted to impeach President Clinton on all four charges made against him.[53] In 1999, while the Senate prepared to vote on the charges, he said: \"I believe these are impeachable and removable offenses.\"[54]\nKasich did not seek re-election in 2000. In February 1999, he formed an exploratory committee to run for president.[55][56] In March 1999 he announced his campaign for the Republican nomination. After very poor fundraising, he dropped out in July 1999, before the Iowa Straw Poll, and endorsed governor George W. Bush of Texas.[57][58]\nAfter leaving Congress, Kasich went to work for Fox News, hosting Heartland with John Kasich on the Fox News Channel and guest-hosting The O'Reilly Factor, filling in for Bill O'Reilly as needed.[59] He also occasionally appeared as a guest on Hannity & Colmes.[60]\nKasich served on the board of directors for several corporations, including Invacare Corp. and the Chicago-based Norvax Inc. In 2001, Kasich joined Lehman Brothers' investment banking division as a managing director, in Columbus, Ohio.[61] He remained at Lehman Brothers until it declared bankruptcy in 2008. That year, Lehman Brothers paid him a $182,692 salary and a $432,200 bonus. He stated that the bonus was for work performed in 2007.[62]\nKasich's employment by Lehman Brothers was criticized during his subsequent campaigns in light of the firm's collapse during the financial crisis.[5] Kasich responded to critics by saying: \"I wasn't involved in the inner workings of Lehman, I was a banker. I didn't go to board meetings or go and talk investment strategy with the top people. I was nowhere near that.  That's like, it's sort of like being a car dealer in Zanesville and being blamed for the collapse of GM.\"[63]\nRepublicans made efforts to recruit Kasich to run for Ohio governor in 2006, but he declined to enter the race.[64]\nIn 2008, Kasich formed Recharge Ohio, a political action committee (PAC) with the goal of raising money to help Republican candidates for the  Ohio House of Representatives and Ohio Senate, in an effort to retain Republican majorities in the Ohio General Assembly.[65] Kasich served as honorary chairman of the PAC.[66]\nOn May 1, 2009, Kasich filed papers to run for governor of Ohio against incumbent Democratic governor Ted Strickland.[67] He formally announced his candidacy on June 1, 2009. On January 15, 2010, Kasich announced Ohio State Auditor Mary Taylor as his running mate.\nDuring a speech before Ashtabula County Republicans in March 2009, Kasich talked about the need to \"break the back of organized labor in the schools,\" according to the Ashtabula Star Beacon.[68]\nOhio teachers' unions supported Strickland, and after Kasich's gubernatorial victory, he said, \"I am waiting for the teachers' unions to take out full-page ads in all the major newspapers, apologizing for what they had to say about me during this campaign.\"[69]\nElsewhere, he said he was willing to work with \"unions that make things.\"[70]\nOn May 4, 2010, Kasich won the Republican nomination for governor, having run unopposed. On November 2, 2010, Kasich defeated Strickland in a closely contested race to win the governorship.[71] He was sworn in at midnight on January 10, 2011, in a private ceremony at the Ohio Statehouse in Columbus. It was then followed by a ceremonial inauguration at the Ohio Theatre at noon on the same day.[72]\nIn November 2014, Kasich won re-election, defeating Democrat Ed FitzGerald, the county executive of Cuyahoga County, 64% to 33%. He won 86 of 88 counties.\nKasich, who was elected with Tea Party support in 2010, faced some backlash from some Tea Party activists. His decision to accept the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act's expansion of Medicaid caused some Tea Party activists to refuse to support his campaign.[73] Kasich supported longtime ally and campaign veteran Matt Borges over Portage County Tea Party chairman Tom Zawistowski for the position of chairman of the Ohio Republican Party. Zawistowski secured just three votes in his run for the chairmanship.[74] Tea Party groups announced they would support a primary challenger, or, if none emerged, the Libertarian nominee.[75]\nUltimately, Zawistowski failed to field anyone on the ballot and the Libertarian nominee (former Republican State Representative Charlie Earl) was removed from the ballot after failing to gain the required number of valid signatures necessary for ballot access.[76]\nKasich is considered by some to be a moderate Republican due to his strong condemnation of far-right conservatives and his endorsement of Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential election. However, his record in the House and as governor of Ohio has led others to point out that his views place him to the right of most moderate politicians. Larry Sabato, the director of the University of Virginia Center for Politics, who has known Kasich for years, says that \"If you had asked me in the 90s about Kasich I would have said he was a Gingrich conservative.\"[77] Kasich's friend Curt Steiner, former chief of staff to former Republican Ohio governor and U.S. senator George Voinovich, described Kasich as a \"solid Republican\" with \"an independent streak.\"[78]\nKasich's tenure as governor was notable for his expansion of Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, his work combating the opioid addiction crisis, his attempt (later reversed by Ohio voters in a 2011 referendum) to curtail collective bargaining for public sector employees, his local government funding cuts, his passage of several anti-abortion laws, his veto of a fetal heartbeat law, his tax cuts, and his evolving position on gun control.[79]\nKasich opposes abortion except in cases of rape, incest, and danger to the mother's life.[77][80] As governor, he signed 18 abortion-restrictive measures into law.[81] In June 2013, Kasich signed into law a state budget, HB 59, which stripped some $1.4 million in federal dollars from Planned Parenthood by placing the organization last on the priority list for family-planning funds;[82][83] provided funding to crisis pregnancy centers;[83] and required women seeking abortions to undergo ultrasounds.[82][84] The budget also barred abortion providers from entering into emergency transfer agreements with public hospitals, requiring abortion providers to find private hospitals willing to enter into transfer agreements.[82] Another provision of the bill requires abortion providers to offer information on family planning and adoption services in certain situations.[82] Under the budget, rape crisis centers could lose public funding if they counseled sexual assault victims about abortion.[83]\nIn 2015, Kasich said in an interview that Planned Parenthood \"ought to be de-funded\", but added that Republicans in Congress should not force a government shutdown over the issue.[85]\nIn December 2016, Kasich approved a ban on abortions after 20 weeks, except when a pregnancy endangers a woman's life, but vetoed HB 493, a law which would have made abortion illegal after detection of a fetal heartbeat (typically 5–6 weeks after conception). Kasich cited the cost to taxpayers of defending the legislation in court, and the likelihood that the \"Heartbeat Bill\" would be struck down in federal court as reasons for vetoing the more restrictive bill.[86][87] In December 2018, Kasich again vetoed a bill to ban abortion after detection of a fetal heartbeat citing the cost to taxpayers and previous rulings by the federal courts.[88][89] He did sign a bill into law that bans the dilation and evacuation procedure commonly used for abortion.[90]\nIn a speech in April 2012, Kasich claimed that climate change is real and is a problem.[91][92] In the same speech, however, Kasich said that the Environmental Protection Agency should not regulate carbon emissions and that instead states and private companies should be in charge of regulating coal-fired power plant emissions.[91] In 2015, Kasich stated that he did not know all the causes of climate change, and that he did not know the extent to which humans contribute to climate change.[93][94]\nIn 2014, Kasich signed into law a bill freezing Ohio's renewable portfolio standard (RPS) program for two years.[95][96] Ohio's RPS program was created by 2008 legislation and required the state to acquire 12.5 percent of its energy portfolio from renewable sources and to reduce energy consumption by 22 percent by 2025.[95] The legislation signed by Kasich to stop the program was supported by Republican legislative leaders, utility companies, and some industry groups, and opposed by environmentalists, some manufacturers, and the American Lung Association.[95][96] In 2016, Kasich broke with fellow Republicans in the state legislature by vetoing their attempt to continue blocking the RPS standards; as a result, the freeze ended on December 31, 2016, and the clean-energy mandate resumed. This veto won Kasich praise from environmentalist groups, and angered Republicans in the state legislature.[97]\nIn his 2015 budget plan, Kasich proposed raising the tax rate on hydraulic fracturing (fracking) activities.[98] Specifically, Kasich's plan called for imposing a 6.5 percent severance tax on crude oil and natural gas extracted via horizontal drilling and sold at the source (about $3.25 per $50 barrel of oil), and for an additional 4.5 percent tax per thousand cubic feet on natural gas and liquefied natural gas (about $0.16 per thousand cubic feet).[98] The proposal would not affect conventional drilling taxes.[98]\nKasich formerly supported fracking in Ohio state parks and forests, signing legislation in mid-2011 authorizing him to appoint a five-member commission to oversee the leasing of mineral rights on state land to the highest bidders.[99] In 2012, Kasich aides planned a campaign with a stated goal to \"marginalize the effectiveness of communications by adversaries about the initiative\" to bring fracking to state parks and forests, naming in an email the Ohio Sierra Club and state Representatives Robert F. Hagan and Nickie Antonio as adversaries of the plan.[99] Kasich never appointed the commission, and the promotional plan was never put into effect.[99] A memo and email relating to the 2012 promotional campaign were publicly released for the first time in February 2015, which according to the Columbus Dispatch attracted criticism from state environmental and liberal groups, as well as Democratic state legislators, who called for an investigation.[99] On the same day the governor reversed himself, with a spokesman saying, \"At this point, the governor doesn't support fracking in state parks. We reserve the right to revisit that, but it's not what he wants to do right now, and that's been his position for the past year and a half.\"[99]\nIn April 2015, Kasich signed a bill aimed at protecting Lake Erie's water quality.[100][101] The bill places restrictions on the spread of manure and other fertilizers that contribute to toxic algal blooms and requires large public water treatment plants to monitor phosphorus levels.[100] The bill had been unanimously approved by both chambers of the Ohio Legislature the previous month.[100]\nKasich supported the Keystone XL oil pipeline project and, along with other Republican governors, signed an open letter in February 2015 urging federal approval for the project.[102] In 2016, in response to a request from South Dakota under the terms of an interstate compact, Kasich dispatched 37 Ohio state troopers to South Dakota, where they were stationed around Dakota Access Pipeline protests near the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation. This controversial deployment prompted unsuccessful petitions to Kasich (from members of the public, Cincinnati City Council members, environmentalists, and some state legislators), who asked Kasich to recall the troopers.[103]\nTo offset a state budget deficit, Kasich proposed selling five state prisons to the for-profit prison industry. The Lake Erie prison was sold for $72.7 million to the Corrections Corporation of America (CCA), generating savings of $3 million. Kasich's Director of Corrections, Gary Mohr, whom he had hired in January 2011, had previously worked for CCA, but he said that he removed himself from the sales process. In an audit in October 2012, CCA was cited for 47 contractual violations, and failed a second audit later that year.[104][105][106] In July 2015, the Kasich administration announced its intent to sell the North Central Correctional Institution at Marion, in order to recoup the state's original investment in the facility and invest the proceeds in community-based alternatives to prison.[107]\nFollowing the separate fatal police shootings of John Crawford III and Tamir Rice, a 12-year-old boy in Ohio, while each were holding BB guns,[108][109] grand juries decided not to indict any of the officers involved.[110] Following this, Kasich created the Ohio Collaborative Community-Police Advisory Board \"to address what he described as frustration and distrust among some Ohioans toward their police departments, particularly among the black community.\"[111][112] The 23-member task force (with 18 members appointed by Kasich) was appointed in January 2015[113] and issued its 629-page final report and recommendations in April 2015.[114][115] The report recommended greater accountability and oversight for police agencies and officers, further community education and involvement in policing, and new use-of-force and recruitment, hiring, and training standards for police agencies.\n[114][115]\nIn April 2015, Kasich created the Ohio Collaborative Community-Police Advisory Board, a twelve-member board tasked (in conjunction with the Ohio Office of Criminal Justice Services and the Ohio Department of Public Safety) with developing statewide standards for the recruiting, hiring and screening of police officers, and for the use of force (including deadly force) by police.[111][116] The advisory board, the first of its kind in Ohio, was also tasked by Kasich with developing \"model policies and best practice recommendations to promote better interaction and communication between law enforcement departments and their home communities.\"[111][117] In August 2015, the board issued its recommendations, which placed \"an emphasis on the preservation of human life and restrict officers to defending themselves or others from death or serious injury.\"[118]\nIn August 2015, Kasich said that he was open to the idea of requiring police officers to wear body cameras.[119]\nAs governor, Kasich presided over the executions of fifteen inmates and commuted the death sentences of seven inmates.[120][121] The last execution in Ohio took place in July 2018. In January 2015, Kasich announced that, due to pending litigation and other issues, he was delaying all seven executions scheduled through January 2016.[120][122] The delay was largely attributed to European pharmaceutical companies, which have refused to supply the state with deadly drugs necessary for executions.[123] In February 2017, Kasich again delayed Ohio executions for an additional three months, after a federal judge ruled that Ohio's three-drug lethal injection protocol is unconstitutional.[124][125]\nKasich used his power of executive clemency sparingly.[126] He has the lowest clemency rate of any Ohio governor since at least the 1980s, when records began to be kept.[121] In six years in office, Kasich granted 86 of the 2,291 requests that he acted upon.[126] In 2016, Kasich granted executive clemency to 13 people; in all of the cases, the Ohio Adult Parole Authority had recommended clemency.[126]\nKasich supports various criminal justice reform efforts; according to conservative Washington Post columnist George Will, Kasich \"favors fewer mandatory minimum sentences and has instituted prison policies that prepare inmates for re-integration into communities.\"[127] In 2011, Kasich signed sentencing reform legislation which allowed judges to sentence defendants convicted of non-violent fourth- and fifth-degree felonies to \"community-based halfway house facilities\" instead of prison; expanded the earned credit system to allow inmates to reduce their sentences; and allowed felons who have already served 80 percent or more of their sentences to be immediately released.[128]\nIn 2012, Kasich signed into law a bill, sponsored by Cleveland Democratic Senator Shirley Smith and Cincinnati Republican Senator Bill Seitz, easing the collateral consequences of criminal conviction.[129]\nIn September 2014, Kasich touted the Ohio's prison system's recidivism rate, which is one of the lowest in the nation.[130] U.S. Senator Rob Portman, a Republican, attributed a drop in Ohio's recidivism rate \"to the bipartisan work of the state legislature, Governor Kasich, Ohio's reentry leaders and the success of programs made possible at the federal level by the Second Chance Act,\" which Portman sponsored.[131]\nIn 2015, Kasich proposed a state budget including $61.7 million for addiction treatment services for prisoners.[132]\nKasich initially expressed opposition to medical marijuana in 2012, saying \"There's better ways to help people who are in pain.\"[133] However, in late 2015 and early 2016, Kasich said he was open to the legalization of medical marijuana.[134][135]\nIn March 2014, in an effort to address the opioid epidemic, Kasich signed legislation (passed unanimously in both chambers of the state legislature) expanding the availability of naloxone, a lifesaving antidote to opioid overdoses; the measure allowed friends and family members of addicts to obtain access to naloxone and for first responders to carry naloxone.[136] In July 2015, Kasich signed legislation further expanding the availability of naloxone, making it available without a prescription.[137]\nIn a 2015 interview with radio talk show host Hugh Hewitt, Kasich said he was opposed to the legalization of recreational marijuana in some states and equated the drug to heroin, stating: \"In my state and across this country, if I happened to be president, I would lead a significant campaign down at the grassroots level to stomp these drugs out of our country.\"[138][139]\nWhen Kasich was asked by Hewitt whether, if elected president, he would federally enforce marijuana laws in states which have legalized marijuana, Kasich characterized it as a states' rights issue and said that \"I'd have to think about it.\"[139] When asked the same question later in 2015, Kasich said: \"I would try to discourage the states from doing it...but I would be tempted to say I don't think we can go and start disrupting what they've decided.\"[140]\nKasich opposed \"Issue 3,\" an Ohio ballot measure in 2015 that proposed the legalization of recreational marijuana, saying it was a \"terrible idea.\"[140][141][142]\nDuring Kasich's tenure, the state has eliminated a budget shortfall that his administration has estimated at $8 billion, but which the Cleveland Plain Dealer estimated at closer to $6 billion.[143] (The New York Times put the number at $7.7 billion).[144]  Ohio also increased its \"rainy day fund\" from effectively zero to more than $2 billion.[145]\nKasich \"closed the budget shortfall in part by cutting aid to local governments, forcing some of them to raise their own taxes or cut services. And increasing sales taxes helped make the income tax cuts possible.\"[144] An analysis by the Plain Dealer in March 2016 found that more than 70 cities and villages had lost at least $1 million a year due to Kasich's budget and taxation policy.[144]\nIn March 2008, Kasich called for \"phasing out\" Ohio's state income tax.[146]\nDuring Kasich's time as governor, Ohio ranked 22nd out of the 50 states for private-sector job growth, at 9.3%.[144]\nKasich signed a state budget in 2011 which eliminated the state's estate tax effective January 1, 2013.[144][147]\nIn 2013, Kasich signed into law a $62 billion two-year state budget.[82]  The budget provided for a 10-percent state income tax cut phased in over three years, and an increase in the state sales tax from 5.5 percent to 5.75 percent.  It also included a 50% tax cut for small business owners on the first $250,000 of annual net income.[82] Kasich used his line-item veto power to reject a measure that would stop the Medicaid expansion (which Kasich had accepted from the federal government) to cover nearly 275,000 working poor Ohioans.[82]\nIn 2015, Kasich signed into law a $71 billion two-year state budget after using his line-item veto power to veto 44 items.[148] The overall 2015 budget provides a 6.3 percent state income-tax cut as a part one component of a $1.9 billion net tax reduction and lowers the top income-tax rate to slightly below 5 percent.[148] The budget also \"spends $955 million more in basic state aid for K-12 schools than the last two-year period\"; \"boosts state funding for higher education to help offset a two-year tuition freeze at public universities\"; expands the Medicaid health program; increases cigarette taxes by 35 cents a pack; and \"prohibits independent health care and child care workers under contract with the state from unionizing.\"[148]\nOn March 31, 2011, in his first year as governor, Kasich signed into law Senate Bill 5, a controversial labor law which restricted collective bargaining rights of public employees, such as police officers, firefighters, and teachers.[149][150]  The legislation, championed by Kasich,[151] prohibited all public employees from striking and restricted their ability to negotiate health care and pension benefits.[149][150] The final version of the legislation signed by Kasich had passed the state Senate in a 17–16 vote (with six Senate Republicans joining all of the Senate Democrats in voting no) and the state House in a 53–44 vote, with two members abstaining.[152]\nDemocrats and labor unions opposed the legislation and placed a referendum on the November 2011 ballot to repeal SB 5.[149] SB 5 also \"sparked numerous protests with thousands of union workers and other opponents descending on the Statehouse, mirroring similar demonstrations in Wisconsin and injecting Ohio into the national debate over Republican governors' attempts to curb public workers' collective bargaining rights.\"[153] Kasich and other supporters of SB 5 characterized the legislation as a necessary measure \"to help public employers control labor costs\" and reduce tax burdens to make Ohio more competitive with other states, while labor unions and other opponents characterized the bill as \"a union-busting attack on the middle class.\"[153]\nOhio voters rejected Senate Bill 5 in a 61 percent to 39 percent vote, which was viewed as a rebuke to Kasich.[149][150][154] On election night, Kasich said in a speech at the Ohio Statehouse that \"It's clear the people have spoken. I heard their voices. I understand their decision. And frankly, I respect what the people have to say in an effort like this.\"[149][154] Following this defeat, Kasich dropped efforts to pass broad-based collective bargaining restrictions, although in 2012 he supported a bill including \"provisions reminiscent of Senate Bill 5\" but applying only to the Cleveland Metropolitan School District.[149]\nIn May 2015, Kasich rescinded executive orders issued by his predecessor Ted Strickland in 2007 and 2008 that provided the right to home health care contractors and in-home child care contractors to collectively bargain with the state.[155]\nKasich has campaigned for a balanced budget amendment to the U.S. Constitution.[156] Kasich created a 501(c)(4) group, Balanced Budget Forever, to promote the cause.[157]\nKasich said in 2016 that \"I have never been an ideological supporter of free trade,\" but has long supported free trade agreements. He is a strong supporter of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, and participated with others in a meeting with President Obama in support of the agreement.[158]\nIn speaking in the 2016 campaign on domestic surveillance, Kasich has \"straddled the line,\" praising Rand Paul for saying that \"we need to get warrants,\" but also saying \"if there's information they need, the government needs to get it.\"[159] Kasich has said there needs to be \"a balance between good intelligence and the need to protect Americans from what can become an aggressive government somewhere down the road.\"[160]\nOn one occasion, Kasich spoke out against proposals to mandate that technology companies provide a \"backdoor\" for the government to access encrypted devices, saying that this could end up aiding hackers.[161] On a subsequent occasion, Kasich said that encryption was dangerous because it could stymie government antiterrorism investigations.[162]\nKasich has condemned whistleblower Edward Snowden as a traitor.[159]\nKasich proposed new legislation which would increase funding to charter schools and poor school districts.[91] He canceled the school-funding formula put into place by his Democratic predecessor, Governor Ted Strickland.[163]\nDuring Kasich's tenure as governor, he pushed to expand charter schools, increase the number of school vouchers that use public money to pay for tuition at private schools, implement a \"merit pay\" scheme for teachers, and evaluate teachers by student standardized test scores in math and reading.[164] Kasich supports the Common Core State Standards and has criticized Republicans who turned against it.[164]\nDuring Kasich's tenure, funding for traditional public schools declined by about $500 million, while funding for charter schools has increased at least 27 percent.[164] As calculated by the Howard Fleeter/Education Tax Policy Institute, total school funding under Kasich (including both charter and district schools) has ranged from a low of $7.1 billion in fiscal year 2013 to $7.8 billion in fiscal year 2015, which was higher than its previous peak under Kasich's predecessor, Ted Strickland.[165] As calculated by the Howard Fleeter/Education Tax Policy Institute, Kasich has proposed total school funding of $8.0 billion in fiscal year 2016 and fiscal year 2017.[165] The Ohio Department of Education—which includes more spending areas than Fleeter's does and so reports higher numbers[165]—projects total school funding for Ohio schools to rise to slightly under $10.5 billion by the end of fiscal year 2017.[166]\nAnalysts disagree \"on whether Kasich's education budgets give increases beyond inflation.\"[165] In the 2015 state budget, Kasich used his line-item veto power \"to cut more than $84 million of funding from public schools.\"[91]\nAccording to a September 2014 story in the Columbus Dispatch, Kasich favored allowing public school districts \"to teach alternatives to evolution—such as intelligent design—if local school officials want to, under the philosophy of 'local control.'\"[167]\nIn 2011, Kasich had the idea of establishing a Holocaust memorial on the grounds of the Ohio Statehouse. Kasich successfully secured approval of the proposal from the Capital Square Review and Advisory Board. The $2 million Ohio Holocaust and Liberators Memorial, designed by Daniel Libeskind, is located across from the Ohio Theatre; the memorial was dedicated in 2014.[168][169]\nIn November 2002, Kasich urged the invasion of Iraq, telling a crowd of students at The Ohio State University: \"We should go to war with Iraq. It's not likely that (Saddam) Hussein will give up his weapons. If he did he would be disgraced in the Arab world.\"[170]\nIn an interview in August 2015, Kasich said: \"I would never have committed ourselves to Iraq.\"[170] A Kasich spokesman subsequently said that \"Kasich was not revising history\" but was instead saying that the Iraq War was a mistake given the facts available now.[170]\nKasich has said that the U.S. \"should've left a base in Iraq\" instead of withdrawing troops in 2011.[40][170]\nIn 2015, Kasich said that airstrikes were insufficient to combat the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, and he would send U.S. ground troops to fight ISIL.[171][172]\nKasich opposed the landmark 2015 international nuclear agreement with Iran,[40] and in September 2015 was one of fourteen Republican governors who sent a letter to President Obama stating \"that we intend to ensure that the various state-level sanctions [against Iran] that are now in effect remain in effect,\" despite the agreement.[173]\nKasich has expressed support for the U.S.'s drone program.[159] He has said, however, that the program should be overseen by the Department of Defense, and not by the CIA.[40]\nKasich has said that he wants to lift budget sequestration for military spending, and \"spend more if necessary.\"[174]\nIn November 2015, Kasich said that if elected president, he \"would send a carrier battle group through the South China Sea\" to send a message to China regarding their claims of sovereignty there.[159]\nKasich supports continued U.S. support of Saudi Arabia, but he criticized Saudi Arabia's \"funding and teaching of radical clerics who are the very people who try to destroy us\".[175]\nKasich favors strong relations between the U.S. and its NATO allies.[176] He supported Senator John McCain's call for maintaining existing U.S. sanctions on Russia, and condemned the Trump administration's consideration of lifting sanctions.[177] Like McCain, Kasich supports imposing \"tougher sanctions against Russia and Putin's inner circle.\"[176] He supports a bipartisan investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections.[178]\nBy the mid-2010s, Kasich had shown much more support for LGBT rights than many of his Republican counterparts. However, during his time in Congress, Kasich was much less accepting, and voted for the Defense of Marriage Act, which barred federal recognition of same-sex marriage.[179]  During this period, Kasich supported a ban on same-sex marriage in Ohio and stated that he did not approve of the \"gay lifestyle.\"[179] As governor of Ohio, Kasich signed an executive order banning discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation for state employees; this was more narrow than the previous executive order signed by his predecessor because it omitted protections for gender identity.[180]\nDuring the 2016 presidential campaign, Kasich struck a more moderate tone compared to his Republican opponents. In June 2015, following the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in Obergefell v. Hodges, which held that there is a fundamental right to same-sex marriage under the Fourteenth Amendment, Kasich said that he was \"obviously disappointed\"[181][182] and that he believes in \"traditional marriage,\"[183] but that the ruling was \"the law of the land and we'll abide by it\" and that it was \"time to move on\" to other issues.[183] During his time as Ohio governor, Kasich appointed Richard Hodges as Ohio Director of Health, who was the lead-respondent in the case.[184]\nKasich indicated that he did not support an amendment to the U.S. Constitution to overturn the decision.[183] In response to a debate question about how he would explain his position on same-sex marriage to one of his daughters if she were gay, Kasich responded, \"The court has ruled, and I said we'll accept it. And guess what, I just went to a wedding of a friend of mine who happens to be gay. Because somebody doesn't think the way I do doesn't mean that I can't care about them or can't love them. So if one of my daughters happened to be that, of course I would love them and I would accept them. Because you know what? That's what we're taught when we have strong faith.\"[185]\nIn September 2015, Kasich commented on the highly publicized case of Kim Davis (the Rowan County, Kentucky clerk who refused to comply with a federal court order directing her to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples), saying: \"Now, I respect the fact that this lady doesn't agree but she's also a government employee, she's not running a church, I wouldn't force this on a church. But in terms of her responsibility I think she has to comply. I don't think — I don't like the fact that she's sitting in a jail, that's absurd as well. But I think she should follow the law.\"[186]\nIn a March 2018 interview on The Rubin Report, Kasich passively came out in support of same-sex marriage saying \"I'm fine with it,\" but stated that he now preferred to show himself as someone in the \"Billy Graham tradition\" that \"avoided social issues\".[187][188] In December 2018, Kasich signed an executive order extending non-discrimination protections for gender identity, including trans and non-binary identities, to state employees in Ohio.[189][190]\nWhile in the U.S. House of Representatives, Kasich had a mixed record on gun policy.[191] He was one of 215 Representatives to vote for the Federal Assault Weapons Ban, which became law in 1994, but voted against the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act (\"Brady Bill\"), which established current background check laws.[191]\nAs governor, Kasich shifted to more pro-gun positions.[191]  In 2011, he signed one bill permitting concealed handguns in bars and another making it easier for people with misdemeanor drug convictions to purchase guns.[191] In 2012, Kasich signed a bill allowing gun owners to transport weapons with loaded magazines in their vehicles and expanding concealed carry permit reciprocity.[191] In December 2014, Kasich signed legislation that reduced the numbers of hours of training required to obtain a concealed carry permit and eliminated the training requirement for permit renewals.[191]\nAfter the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting in February 2018, Kasich called for restrictions on the sales of AR-15 style rifles.[192]\nKasich opted to accept Medicaid-expansion funding provided by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA or \"Obamacare\") in Ohio.[193][194][195] This decision angered many Statehouse Republicans, who wanted Kasich to reject the expansion.[194][196]\nTotal spending on Medicaid by the state was almost $2 billion (or 7.6 percent) below estimates for the fiscal year ending in June 2015, according to a report by Kasich's administration.  The lower-than-expected costs were attributed to expanded managed care, shorter nursing home stays and increased in-home care for seniors, capitated reimbursement policies, increased automation to determine eligibility for the program and pay care providers, and an improving economy in the state which allowed some participants to move out of the program.[197]\nIn an October 2014 interview, Kasich said that repeal of the ACA was \"not gonna happen\" and stated that \"The opposition to it was really either political or ideological. I don't think that holds water against real flesh and blood, and real improvements in people's lives.\"[194] Kasich later said that he was referring solely to the law's Medicaid expansion, and that \"my position is that we need to repeal and replace\" the rest of the law.[194][198] In 2015, Kasich expressed support for many provisions of the ACA (ensuring coverage for people with preexisting conditions, the use of insurance exchanges, and Medicaid expansion), but opposed mandates.[199]\nIn 2017, after Donald Trump took office and congressional Republicans maneuvered to repeal the ACA, Kasich criticized Republican hard-liners in Congress who demanded a full ACA repeal, saying that full repeal was \"not acceptable\" when 20 million people gained insurance under the ACA and that doing so would be a \"political impossibility.\" Kasich urged that the Medicaid expansion be preserved in some form, criticizing the House Republican legislation that would cut the Medicaid expansion and phase out health insurance subsidies for low-income Americans.[200] Kasich said that the nation's \"soul\" was at stake if Republicans passed legislation that left millions without health insurance.[201] After the failure of the House Republican health-care legislation, Kasich met in Washington with members of the Republican Tuesday Group and urged fellow Republicans to work with Democrats to make more modest changes to the Affordable Care Act.[202] In May 2017, Kasich said that the version of the Republican health care bill that passed the House was \"inadequate\" and would harm patients; Kasich said that Republicans \"should've worked with the Democrats\" on the bill rather than passing legislation merely to fulfill a campaign pledge.[203]\nIn June 2017, Kasich said that he didn't \"have a problem\" with gradually phasing out the ACA's expansion of Medicaid over a seven-year period, but only if Congress provided states with significantly more, more than the House Republican bill provided for, and only if Congress granted states more authority to manage the program.[204] Along with three other Republican governors (Asa Hutchinson of Arkansas, Brian Sandoval of Nevada, and Rick Snyder of Michigan), Kasich signed a letter to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell with an outline of their wishes for an health care bill. Kasich and the others specifically called upon Congress to \"end the requirement that state Medicaid programs cover nearly every prescription drug approved by the Food and Drug Administration.\"[204] Kasich and the other governors' views were seen as influential, because their states have Republican senators and the Republicans have only a narrow majority in the Senate.[204]\nIn 2010, while running for governor, Kasich expressed support for amending the U.S. Constitution to abolish the Fourteenth Amendment's guarantee of jus soli (birthright) citizenship for people born in the United States.[205][206] Kasich also told the Columbus Dispatch at the time that \"One thing that I don't want to reward is illegal immigration.\"[205]\nIn 2014, Kasich acknowledged that his stance on immigration has \"evolved\" because \"maybe [I'm] a little smarter now,\" stating: \"I don't want to see anybody in pain. So I guess when I look at this now, I look at it differently than I did in '10. ... When I look at a group of people who might be hiding, who may be afraid, who may be scared, who have children, I don't want to be in a position of where I make it worse for them.\"[205] That year, Kasich expressed openness to a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, saying at a Republican Governors Association (RGA) meeting in Florida, \"I don't like the idea of citizenship when people jump the line, [but] we may have to do it.\"[206] Kasich was the only governor at the RGA conference \"to express openly a willingness to create a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants.\"[205]\nIn August 2015, while running for president, Kasich called for a path to legal status (but not necessarily citizenship) for undocumented immigrants and for a guest worker program.[206][207] Kasich also appeared to disavow his earlier stance against birthright citizenship, stating \"I don't think we need to go there\"; called for completion of a fence along the U.S.-Mexico border; and noted that undocumented immigrants who were brought to the U.S. as young children may obtain driver's licenses in Ohio.[206][207]\nIn October 2015, Kasich criticized Donald Trump's \"plan to build a wall along the Mexican border and remove immigrants who entered the United States illegally,\" calling these notions \"just crazy.\"[208]\nIn September 2015, Kasich said that the U.S. had a moral responsibility to accept refugees fleeing war and violence in Syria. Subsequently, however, Kasich moved to the right, and in November 2015 wrote a letter to President Obama asking that no additional Syrian refugees be resettled in Ohio.[209] Kasich opposed Trump's executive order on travel and immigration, which Trump signed one week after taking office in January 2017. Kasich said that the order was \"ham-handed\" because it \"sowed so much confusion\" and \"sent a message that somehow the United States was looking sideways at Muslims.\"[210]\nKasich has a \"long-standing political partnership\" with his lieutenant governor, Mary Taylor.[211] In 2014, Kasich defended Taylor after her chief of staff, and that chief of staff's administrative assistant, resigned following a timesheet probe.[212][213] Kasich said of Taylor's handling of the matter: \"Mary did the right thing and I support her.\"[213]\nIn 2017, the Kasich-Taylor relationship frayed after Taylor abandoned Kasich ally Matt Borges in his bid for chairman of the Ohio Republican Party, and instead chose to support Jane Timken, who was actively supported by Donald Trump,[211][214] who sought revenge against Kasich for his choice not to endorse Trump.[215] Nevertheless, Kasich indicated that Taylor had \"been a good partner\" over his term and indicated that he would support her if she chose to run for governor in 2018.[216]\nUpon taking office in 2011, Kasich received criticism for appointing an initial all-white cabinet of 22 members.[217] Responding to criticism for not appointing any black, Hispanic, or Asian Cabinet members, Kasich said: \"I don't look at things from the standpoint of any of these sort of metrics that people tend to focus on, race or age, or any of those things. It's not the way I look at things... I want the best possible team I can get.\"[217] Shortly afterward, on February 2, 2011, Kasich made his first minority appointment to the Cabinet, naming Michael Colbert, a black man, to lead the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services.[218]\nAs of 2018[update], four members of Kasich's Cabinet were members of racial minorities.[219]\nThroughout his first gubernatorial campaign, Kasich opposed the Ohio Hub higher-speed passenger rail project (a proposed 258-mile Cleveland-to-Cincinnati train) and promised to cancel it, claiming that it would average speeds of merely 36 mph.[220] In his first press conference following his election victory, Kasich declared \"That train is dead...I said it during the campaign: It is dead.\"[221]\nAs governor-elect, Kasich lobbied the federal government to use $400 million in federal dollars allocated for high-speed rail for freight rail projects instead.[220][222] In a November 2010 letter to Kasich, Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood wrote that the federal funding was specifically allocated by the 2009 economic stimulus act for high-speed rail, and could not be used for other purposes.[222] In a December 2010 meeting with President Barack Obama, Kasich again unsuccessfully lobbied to use the grant money for freight rail rather than high-speed rail.[223]\nIn December 2010, the U.S. Department of Transportation announced that Ohio would lose the $385 million in grant funds allocated for high-speed passenger rail, since Kasich had informed them that he had no intention of ever building high-speed rail projects.[224] (Almost $15 million had already been spent for preliminary engineering.[220]) The $385 million was instead diverted to other states, such as California, New York, and Florida, which planned high-speed rail using the grant money for its congressionally intended purpose.[220][224] Outgoing governor Ted Strickland, who championed the project, expressed disappointment, saying that the loss of funding for the project was \"one of the saddest days during my four years as governor\" and that \"I can't understand the logic of giving up these vital, job-creating resources to California and Florida at a time when so many Ohioans need jobs.\"[220][224]\nKasich is an opponent of the Cincinnati Streetcar project.[225][226]\nIn April 2015, Kasich signed a two-year transportation budget bill which allocated $7.06 billion for highway construction and maintenance, $600 million to local governments for road and bridge projects, and an additional million over the last budget for public transportation.[227]\nIn February 2014, Kasich signed into law a bill which cut six days from Ohio's early voting period, including the \"golden week\" (a period at the beginning of early voting when voters could both register to vote and cast an in-person absentee ballot).[228][229] The measures were hotly contested in the state legislature,[228] passing on a party-line vote, with Republicans in favor and Democrats opposed.[230] This measure prompted two federal lawsuits.[231] The first lawsuit, brought by the American Civil Liberties Union of Ohio on behalf of the NAACP and League of Women Voters of Ohio, resulted in a settlement in April 2015, in which the state agreed to provide evening and Sunday hours for early voting in elections in Ohio through 2018.[232] The second lawsuit, Ohio Democratic Party v. Husted, was brought in May 2015 by Democratic election lawyer Marc Elias; plaintiffs argued that the Ohio bill eliminating \"golden week\" violated the Constitution and the Voting Rights Act because it disproportionately burdened black, Latino and young voters. The federal district court agreed and struck down the legislation, but the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit reversed that decision in a 2–1 vote, and the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear an appeal.[233] In July 2015, Kasich said that it was \"pure demagoguery\" for Hillary Clinton to \"say that there are Republicans who are deliberately trying to keep people from voting.\"[234]\nIn April 2015, Kasich used his line-item veto power to veto a provision added to a highway-budget bill by Republicans in the state legislature that would have required college students who register to vote in Ohio to obtain a state driver's license and vehicle registration, imposing an estimated $75 in motor vehicle costs on out-of-state college students who wanted to vote in the state.[235][236][237] The veto was celebrated by voting rights advocates, Ohio Democrats, and the Cleveland Plain Dealer editorial board, which viewed the proposal as effectively a \"poll tax\" motivated by a partisan desire to limit college-town voting.[235][236][237]\nIn Ohio, justices of the Ohio Supreme Court are elected, but the governor can fill unexpired terms. In May 2012, Ohio Supreme Court Associate Justice Evelyn Lundberg Stratton announced she would retire at the end of 2012.[238]  In December 2012, Kasich appointed Judge Judith L. French to Stratton's unexpired term, which ran from January 1, 2013, through January 1, 2015.[239]\nOn October 18, 2019, Kasich publicly stated that Donald Trump should be impeached. He had previously said there was not enough evidence to impeach the President.[240][241]\nIn April 2015, Kasich announced the formation of his \"New Day For America\" group. Formerly a 527 group, it filed as a super PAC in July 2015.[242] Between April 20 and June 30, 2015, the super PAC raised over $11.1 million from 165 \"reportable contributions,\" including 34 contributions of $100,000 or more.[242] Major contributors to the PAC include Floyd Kvamme, who donated $100,000, and Jim Dicke, chairman emeritus of Crown Equipment Corporation, who donated $250,000.[242] According to FEC filings, Kasich's campaign had $2.5 million on hand at the beginning of 2016.[243]\nIn May 2015, sources close to him had said he was \"virtually certain\" to run for the Republican nomination for president.[244] On July 21, 2015, Kasich announced his candidacy for the Republican presidential nomination during a speech at the Ohio Union, the student union of his alma mater, the Ohio State University.[245][246][247]\nOn January 30, 2016, the New York Times endorsed Kasich for the Republican nomination. The Times editorial board strongly rebuked leading candidates Donald Trump and Senator Ted Cruz and wrote that Kasich, \"though a distinct underdog, is the only plausible choice for Republicans tired of the extremism and inexperience on display in this race.\"[248]\nOn the campaign trail, Kasich sought to project a sunny, optimistic message, describing himself as \"the prince of light and hope.\"[249][250] This marked a change in tone for Kasich, who had developed a reputation as an abrasive governor.[251] Viewed as a long-shot contender, Kasich took an \"above-the-fray approach to his rivals\" and \"ran unapologetically as a candidate with experience\" even as others ran as \"outsider\" contenders.[252]\nKasich came in second place in the New Hampshire primary on February 9, 2016, behind winner Trump. The Cincinnati Enquirer reported that this was \"the best possible result\" for Kasich and lent \"credence to the notion that he can emerge\" as a Republican alternative to Trump and Cruz.[253]\nUltimately, however, Kasich's message \"never caught on in a campaign that ... exposed the anger and frustration coursing through the electorate\" and he \"found himself stuck in fourth place in a three-man race, trailing Senator Marco Rubio of Florida in the delegate count\" although Rubio had dropped out of the race in March.[252]\nThe only state won by Kasich was his home state of Ohio,[252] which gave him 66 delegates in its March 2016 winner-take-all primary but still left him with \"a steep delegate deficit against his rivals.\"[254] Kasich's unsuccessful campaign strategy hinged on the possibility of a contested (or brokered) Republican National Convention, in which no single candidate has enough delegates to win the nomination on the first ballot, something that has not happened in either of the two major parties' presidential nominating conventions since 1952.[255] Kasich suspended his campaign for the Republican presidential nomination on May 4, 2016, one day after Trump won the Republican primary in Indiana. The third remaining contender, Cruz, quit the race shortly before Kasich did, leaving Trump as the only candidate remaining in the Republican field and hence the party's presumptive nominee.[252]\nA 2018 study on media coverage of the 2016 election noted \"the paradox of the Kasich campaign's longevity while it lacked public interest provides some evidence for the idea that Kasich's biggest supporters were the media\".[256]\nFollowing his withdrawal from the race, Kasich did not extend his support to Trump. In May and June 2016, Kasich said that Trump was a divisive figure rather than a \"unifier,\" said he had no plans to endorse Trump in the near future, and ruled out the possibility of seeking the Vice Presidency as Trump's running mate.[257][258]\nKasich said it was \"hard to say\" whether he would ever endorse Trump; he added, \"I can't go for dividing, name calling, or somebody that doesn't really represent conservative principles.\"[259] Kasich said he had ruled out voting for Clinton but lacked the enthusiasm to fully back Trump.[260]\nIn August 2016, Kasich repeated an earlier claim that the Trump campaign had offered him a powerful vice presidency, \"putting him in charge of all domestic and foreign policy\".[261] The Trump campaign denied that such an offer had been made.[261] Kasich also doubted whether Trump could win Ohio, a critical state in the election.[261] It was speculated that Kasich was looking towards a 2020 campaign.[262] This speculation was strengthened by a report that Kasich had planned to give a speech to the American Enterprise Institute less than 48 hours after the election but cancelled it the morning after the election when it was clear that Trump had won.[263]\nKasich received an electoral vote for the presidency from one faithless elector, Christopher Suprun of Texas, who had been pledged to vote for Trump. An elector in Colorado also attempted to vote for him, but that vote was discarded; the elector was replaced by an alternate elector who voted, as pledged, for Clinton.[264]\nIn February 2017, Kasich met with Trump at the White House[265] in a private meeting that followed a bitter feud.[266] Kasich indicated that he hoped for Trump's success, but would continue to be critical when he thought it was necessary.[266] The same month, Kasich's chief political advisors launched a political group, Two Paths America, in an effort to promote Kasich and his views and draw a contrast with Trump.[267] In April 2017, Kasich also released a book, Two Paths: America Divided or United, written with Daniel Paisner.[268][269] The creation of the group prompted speculation he could possibly run for president again,[267] but Kasich said that he had no plans to seek elected office in the future.[270]\nIn April 2017, during a CNN town hall, Kasich, while stating that he was \"very unlikely\" to do so, reopened the possibility that he might run for president in 2020.[271][272] On August 20, however, he reiterated his previous statement that he had no plans to run; rather, he stated that he was \"rooting for [Trump] to get it together.\"[273]\nIn October 2017, during an interview with CNN's Jake Tapper, Kasich said he had not \"given up\" on the Republican Party, but added that \"if the party can't be fixed ... I'm not going to be able to support the party. Period. That's the end of it.\"[274][275] In March 2018, he told The Weekly Standard that he was \"increasingly open\" to running for president in the 2020 presidential election;[276] however, in May 2019, he again declared that he would not seek the presidency in 2020.[277]\nIn October 2019, Kasich expressed support for the impeachment inquiry against Trump, saying that the \"final straw\" for him was when Trump's acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney admitted that Trump had withheld U.S. aid from Ukraine in part to pressure the country to investigate Trump's domestic political rivals, a statement that Mulvaney later said were misconstrued.[278][279]\nKasich confirmed on August 10, 2020, that he would be speaking at the 2020 Democratic National Convention in support of presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden.[11][280] Kasich said that his conscience compelled him to speak out against Trump and in support of Biden, even if it resulted in blowback against him, adding, \"I've been a reformer almost all of my life. I've been very independent and I'm a Republican but the Republican Party has always been my vehicle but never my master. You have to do what you think is right in your heart and I'm comfortable here.\"[11]\nKasich has been married twice. His first marriage was to Mary Lee Griffith from 1975 to 1980, and they had no children. Griffith has campaigned for Kasich since their divorce. Kasich and his current wife, Karen Waldbillig, a former public relations executive, were married in March 1997 and have twin daughters, Emma and Reese.[281]\nKasich was raised a Catholic, but considers denominations irrelevant, while stating that \"there's always going to be a part of me that considers myself a Catholic.\" He drifted away from his religion as an adult, but came to embrace an Anglican faith after his parents were killed in a car crash by a drunk driver on August 20, 1987.[282][283][284][285] He joined the Episcopal Church (United States) as an adult.[286][287] Kasich has said he \"doesn't find God in church\" but does belong to St. Augustine's in Westerville, Ohio, which is part of the Anglican Church in North America, a conservative church with which he remained when it broke off from the Episcopal Church (United States).[285][286][287]\nKasich has authored five books:",

            "report_content": "Ralph Shearer Northam (born September 13, 1959) is an American physician and politician serving as the 73rd governor of Virginia since January 13, 2018.[1] A pediatric neurologist by occupation, he was an officer in the U.S. Army Medical Corps from 1984 to 1992. Northam, a member of the Democratic Party, served as the 40th lieutenant governor of Virginia from 2014 to 2018 prior to winning the governorship against Republican nominee Ed Gillespie in the 2017 election.[2] Northam is both the second Lieutenant Governor of Virginia and the first Governor of Virginia to have graduated from the Virginia Military Institute.\nNortham was born in the town of Nassawadox on Virginia's Eastern Shore on September 13, 1959.[3][4] He and his older brother of two years, Thomas, were raised on a water-side farm, just outside Onancock, Virginia.[5] The family grew a variety of crops and tended livestock on their seventy-five-acre (30 ha) property.[6] As a teenager, Northam worked on a ferry to Tangier Island and as a deckhand on fishing charters; he also worked on a neighbor's farm and as a \"stock boy\" at Meatland grocery store.[5][7][8] He and Thomas attended desegregated public schools.[5][9] Northam graduated from Onancock High School, where his class was predominately African American.[10]\nNortham's mother, Nancy B. Shearer, was originally from Washington, D.C. She was a part-time nurse at Northampton-Accomack Memorial Hospital, and her father was a surgeon.[7][11][12] Nancy Shearer died in 2009.[7] Northam's father, Wescott B. Northam, served as a lawyer and is a veteran of World War II; he entered politics in the 1960s, serving three terms as Commonwealth's Attorney for Accomack County, Virginia. After losing election to a fourth term, Wescott Northam was appointed as a Circuit Court judge for Accomack and Northampton counties.[5][7][11][12] Wescott Northam's own father, Thomas Long Northam, had served as a judge in the same court.[7]\nThomas Long Northam died when Wescott Northam was only fourteen, and a few years later, the family farm in Modest Town, Virginia, where Wescott had been born, was sold.[5][9] The farm had first come into the family through Ralph Northam's great-great-grandfather, James, who along with his son, Levi Jacob, had owned slaves – one of whom, Raymond Northam, was freed to enlist in the 9th Regiment of Colored Troops (Union Army, Civil War). Ralph Northam was unaware of his family's slave-owning history until his father conducted research into their ancestry during the time of Northam's gubernatorial campaign. Upon learning about this part of his family's history, Northam said, \"The news that my ancestors owned slaves disturbs and saddens me, but the topic of slavery has always bothered me. My family's complicated story is similar to Virginia's complex history. We're a progressive state, but we once had the largest number of slaves in the union.\"[9]\nIn high school, Northam was voted \"Most Likely to Succeed\"[10] and graduated as salutatorian.[13] He was a member of his school's basketball and baseball teams.[7][10] Northam graduated from the Virginia Military Institute (VMI) in 1981, where he served as president of VMI's honor court and received a bachelor's degree in biology.[14][15][16] He went on to Eastern Virginia Medical School, earning his Doctor of Medicine in 1984.[14]\nFrom 1984 to 1992 he served as a United States Army medical officer. During his Army service, he completed a pediatric residency at Brooke Army Medical Center in San Antonio, Texas, followed by a child neurology fellowship at Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington, D.C. and Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, Maryland.[17] During Operation Desert Storm, he treated evacuated casualties at Landstuhl Regional Medical Center in Germany.\nNortham was discharged from the U.S. Army in 1992 at the rank of major, after having completed eight years of service.[10] Since 1992,[18] Northam has been a pediatric neurologist at Children's Hospital of the King's Daughters in Norfolk, Virginia.[19]\nPrior to entering politics, Northam voted for Republican George W. Bush in the 2000 and 2004 presidential elections, a fact that opponents raised in later Democratic primaries.[20][21] Northam says that he was apolitical at the time and regretted those votes,[21] saying: \"Politically, there was no question, I was underinformed.\"[13]\nNortham first ran for office in 2007 in the 6th Senate district, which includes the Eastern Shore of Virginia; Mathews County, on the Middle Peninsula; and parts of the cities of Norfolk and Virginia Beach.[8] He was unopposed for the Democratic nomination. On November 6, 2007, he defeated Nick Rerras, a two-term Republican incumbent, 17,307 votes to 14,499.[22]\nHe was re-elected in November 2011, defeating Ben Loyola Jr., a defense contractor, 16,606 votes to 12,622.[23]\nOne of Northam's first major activities as a state legislator was to lead an effort to pass a ban on smoking in restaurants in Virginia. The bill failed the first time, but it passed the next year and Governor Tim Kaine signed it into law.[24][25]\nIn 2009, Northam – a self-described \"conservative on fiscal issues and liberal on social issues\"[26] – was the subject of an attempt by state Senate Republicans to get him to switch parties.[27] This action would have given Republicans control of the State Senate, but after news of the imminent switch broke on Twitter, Democrats held a closed-door meeting, and Northam reiterated that he was not leaving the party.[28] He later said, \"I guess it's nice to be wanted, but I'm a Democrat, and that's where I'm staying.\"[29]\nNortham ran for Lieutenant Governor of Virginia in the 2013 election.[30] Northam competed against U.S. Chief Technology Officer Aneesh Chopra for the Democratic nomination.[31] On June 11, 2013, Northam won the Democratic primary over Chopra with 54% of the vote to Chopra's 46%.[32][33]\nOn November 5, 2013, Northam was elected as Virginia's 40th Lieutenant Governor over Republican E. W. Jackson, receiving 55% of the vote to Jackson's 45%.[34] Northam was the first Democrat since Tim Kaine in 2001 to be elected Lieutenant Governor of Virginia.\nIn February 2015, just over a year into his term as lieutenant governor, Northam confirmed his interest in running for Governor of Virginia in 2017.[35][36] He made these intentions official on November 17, 2015, via an email to supporters.[37]\nIn the Democratic primary, Northam faced Tom Perriello, who had previously served as a Congressman from Virginia and as a diplomat in the Obama administration.[38][39] The primary campaign was often described as a proxy battle between the Bernie Sanders/Elizabeth Warren wing of the Democratic Party, represented by Perriello, and the Hillary Clinton wing, represented by Northam,[38] although this take was dismissed as little more than a \"talking point\" by The Washington Post's editorial board, which praised both candidates and wrote, \"the policy differences between the two, though real, are not enormous\".[40] The Washington Post endorsed Northam primarily on the basis of his \"experience\" and \"temperament\".[40] In its endorsement, the publication explained that the next governor would likely have to work with a Republican-controlled legislature and wrote,\n\"If any Democratic governor can nudge GOP majorities in his direction, it's Mr. Northam. That matters in a state where governors, barred from running for consecutive terms, have one brief shot at getting things done.\"[40]\nOn June 13, 2017, Northam won the Democratic nomination with 56% of the vote to Perriello's 44%.[41] In the general election, Northam faced Ed Gillespie, who had previously served as Counselor to the President under George W. Bush, chair of the Republican National Committee, and chair of the Republican Party of Virginia.[42][43] Northam's campaign funds were heavily depleted by the end of the primary race. He was left with around $1.75 million, which amounted to roughly half of Gillespie's remaining funds.[44] Northam quickly gained the advantage however – by the end of the summer, his available funds had grown twice as large as Gillespie's, with two months left in the campaign. Northam led Gillespie among small donors, as well: \"5,900 donations under $100 to Gillespie's 2,100.\"[45]\nIn October 2017, the Northam campaign released a small number of flyers omitting Northam's running-mate for lieutenant governor, Justin Fairfax. These were released at the request of Laborers' International Union of North America, which had endorsed only part of that year's Democratic ticket. Northam and that year's Democratic nominee for Attorney General, Mark Herring, were both endorsed by LIUNA and were both included on the flyer. LIUNA withheld its endorsement from Fairfax and explained that Fairfax opposes the construction of natural gas pipelines that are favored by the organization. As Fairfax is black, while Northam and Herring are both white, some activists criticized the decision to accommodate LIUNA's request. All houses that received the LIUNA flyers also received standard campaign flyers including Fairfax.[46][47]\nDuring the campaign, Gillespie and President Donald Trump accused Northam of being responsible for the increased activities of the MS-13 gangs and of being \"in favor of sanctuary cities that let dangerous illegal immigrants back on the streets.\"[48][49] Gillespie and Trump said that Northam had been the deciding vote to stop a Republican bill in the state Senate which would have banned sanctuary cities and that this contributed to the surge in MS-13 violence; a notion that FactCheck.org found to be \"misleading\".[48] The Washington Post and CNN noted that there are no actual sanctuary cities in Virginia.[49][50] Gillespie himself acknowledged that Virginia did not have sanctuary cities.[49] The Washington Post furthermore noted that there is no evidence that sanctuary cities increase crime or gang activity,[51] and that Virginia communities with higher immigrant populations have lower crime rates.[52]\nLater that month, the Latino Victory Fund, which was supporting Northam's campaign, released an ad in which a pickup truck, adorned with a Gillespie bumper sticker, a \"Don't tread on me\" license plate, and a Confederate flag, chases down minority children and corners them in an alley – one of the children in the ad then wakes up, revealing the scene to have been a nightmare.[53][54] Although Northam and his campaign were not involved with the ad, Northam initially defended it, saying Gillespie's own ads \"have promoted fearmongering, hatred, bigotry, racial divisiveness,\" and adding, \"I mean, it's upset a lot of communities, and they have the right to express their views as well.\"[55] The ad was pulled the following day in the hours after the terrorist attack in New York City, in which a man killed several people by running them over with a truck.[55][56] Northam then distanced himself from the ad, re-emphasizing that it was not released by his campaign and saying that it is not one that he would have chosen to run.[57] A spokesman for the campaign said that the Latino Victory Fund's decision to pull the ad was \"appropriate and the right thing to do.\"[55] FOX 5 DC reported that the Northam campaign had accepted $62,000 as an in-kind media contribution from the Latino Victory Fund.[58]\nDuring the final week of the campaign, Northam stated that he would continue opposing a preemptive ban on sanctuary cities in Virginia, as he had done while serving in the lieutenant governor position, although he also stated that if any sanctuary cities emerged in Virginia, he would support banning them.[59] In response, the progressive group Democracy for America stated that it stopped direct aid of Northam's campaign.[60] Howard Dean, who founded Democracy for America, but left the organization in 2016, wrote on Twitter that the organization had discredited itself and called its decision to stop aiding Northam's campaign \"incredibly stupid\".[61] Democracy for America had already stopped collecting data for Northam and had ceased mentioning him in get-out-the-vote calls, due to the Northam campaign's decision to release LiUNA's flyers omitting Justin Fairfax.[62][63]\nNortham held campaign rallies with former President Barack Obama[64] and former Vice President Joe Biden during the general election campaign.[65]\nAccording to The Washington Post, while campaigning for governor, Northam owned stock in several companies \"doing extensive work in Virginia\". Northam stated during the campaign that if elected governor, he would place his financial investments into a blind trust, so as to avoid any potential conflicts of interest.[66]\nAccording to a November 3, 2017 report by the Virginia Public Access Project, Northam raised $33.8 million to Gillespie's $24.5 million.[67]\nNortham was elected 73rd Governor of Virginia on November 7, 2017, defeating Ed Gillespie in the general election with a larger-than-expected nine-point margin of victory.[68]\nNortham was sworn in as Governor of Virginia at noon on January 13, 2018 at the State Capitol.[69] He became the second Eastern Shore native to serve as Governor of Virginia, after Henry A. Wise (who was elected in 1855)[7][69][70] and the second alumnus of Virginia Military Institute to serve as governor, after Westmoreland Davis (who was elected in 1917).[69] A majority of Northam's cabinet-level officials are female, a first in Virginia history.[71] Residents from every county in Virginia attended Northam's inauguration (which reportedly marked another first for the state)[72][73] and twenty-six groups participated in the inaugural parade, which has been called the largest and most diverse in state history.[73][74]\nLeading up to his inauguration, Northam announced that he would establish a new cabinet-level position, Chief Workforce Advisor, which would be responsible for coordinating the state's workforce development programs.[75] To fill the position, Northam appointed Megan Healy, who had previously served as assistant vice chancellor for academic services and employer partnerships at the Virginia Community College System and as the director of STEM-H during the McAuliffe administration.[75][76] Healy's husband served on Northam's transition team.[75]\nIn June 2018, six months into Northam's governorship, a class action lawsuit was publicly disclosed, which had been filed the previous October, claiming that Latino teenage detainees at the Shenandoah Valley Juvenile Center had been physically abused by staff members there. Most of the plaintiffs were being held at the facility on immigration charges. The abuse described in the lawsuit was alleged to have occurred from 2015 through 2018. The Shenandoah Valley Juvenile Center denied all claims in the lawsuit, while Northam called the allegations \"disturbing\" and directed state agencies to conduct an investigation.[77][78]\nAround two months later, the investigation concluded with no findings of ongoing abuse. Allegations of past abuse were not included within the scope of the investigation, and the lawsuit is still pending. The investigation resulted in the Virginia Department of Juvenile Justice presenting the Shenandoah Valley Juvenile Center with recommendations for new practices, such as improved training for facility staff members. Northam urged the juvenile center to adopt these recommendations, and the center responded with plans to do so.[79] As youth held in Virginia facilities on immigration charges are there through outside contracts with the federal government, the Virginia Department of Juvenile Justice lacked oversight of these youth when the investigation began. In September of that year, the department expanded its authority to include oversight of youth held through any outside contract in Virginia facilities.[80][81]\nOn February 1, 2019, images from Northam's medical school yearbook were published on the far-right website Big League Politics.[82][83][84] The photos showed an image of an unidentified person in blackface and an unidentified person in a Ku Klux Klan hood on Northam's page in the yearbook.[85][86][87] A spokesman for Eastern Virginia Medical School confirmed that the image appeared in its 1984 yearbook.[88] Shortly after the news broke, Northam apologized for appearing in the photo[88] and issued a statement saying:\nEarlier today, a website published a photograph of me from my 1984 medical school yearbook in a costume that is clearly racist and offensive. I am deeply sorry for the decision I made to appear as I did in this photo and for the hurt that decision caused then and now. This behavior is not in keeping with who I am today and the values I have fought for throughout my career in the military, in medicine, and in public service. But I want to be clear, I understand how this decision shakes Virginians’ faith in that commitment. I recognize that it will take time and serious effort to heal the damage this conduct has caused. I am ready to do that important work. The first step is to offer my sincerest apology and to state my absolute commitment to living up to the expectations Virginians set for me when they elected me to be their Governor.[85][89][90]\nPrior to issuing his apology, Northam had privately reacted in confusion to the photo and told several people that he did not believe that he was either of the men depicted in the photo.[91] Early that evening, he had also told Lieutenant Governor Justin Fairfax that although he had no recollection of the photo, he considered it a possibility that he was one of the two men depicted.[92][93] According to The Washington Post, \"two people familiar with the events of that evening\" said that Northam \"decided to take the blame\" for the photo due to the pressure on him to issue a statement, even though at the time, Northam was still confused about the photo's origins.[91]\nTwo days earlier on January 30, Northam had made controversial comments about abortion during a WTOP interview about the Repeal Act, where he stated that if a severely deformed or otherwise non-viable fetus was born after an unsuccessful abortion attempt, \"the infant would be resuscitated if that's what the mother and the family desired, and then a discussion would ensue between the physicians and the mother.\"[94] Conservative politicians and media figures characterized Northam's comments as promoting infanticide.[95] After the yearbook photo was publicized, many conservative media outlets compared the two controversies and described them as a \"bad week\" for the governor.[96][97] According to the Washington Post, the photo was sent as a tip to Big League Politics, the website that first published the photo on February 1, by one or more medical school classmates who were concerned about Northam's abortion comments.[83]\nThe Virginia Senate's Democratic leader, Dick Saslaw, was among the few politicians who initially defended Northam,[98] but later joined with the rest of his caucus in calling for Northam's resignation.[99] Most other prominent Virginia politicians, including former governor Terry McAuliffe, under whom Northam served as lieutenant governor,[100] the  Speaker of the House of Delegates,[101] the Virginia Legislative Black Caucus,[102] senators Tim Kaine and Mark Warner in a joint statement with Rep. Bobby Scott,[103] and both the Republican Party of Virginia and Democratic Party of Virginia, called on him to resign.[104][105][106] President Donald Trump decried the photo, as well as Northam's earlier comments on abortion, as \"unforgivable\".[107] Several prominent national Republicans, such as House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy and Republican National Committee chair Ronna Romney McDaniel joined in calling for Northam's resignation.[108][109][110] Major national Democratic officials also called for Northam to step down, including 2020 presidential candidates Tulsi Gabbard, Julian Castro, Cory Booker, Kirsten Gillibrand, Elizabeth Warren and Kamala Harris,[111][112] House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic Governors Association,[113][114] former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton,[115] Senator Bernie Sanders,[116] and former Vice President of the United States Joe Biden.[117] Faced with increasing calls for his resignation from fellow Democrats, Northam reportedly considered leaving the Democratic Party and trying to hold on to the governorship as an independent.[118][119]\nAfter issuing his apology and as pressure mounted for his resignation, Northam called friends and family to determine whether the photo actually depicts him.[120] The following morning, Northam told staffers that he was convinced he was not in the photo.[91] Sleep-deprived and ignoring the protests of some staffers, Northam held a press conference that afternoon,[91] in which he publicly denied that he was either of the men in the photo, but did admit to having \"darkened [his] face\" with shoe polish as part of a Michael Jackson costume around the same time.[121] Reaction to the press conference was intensely negative and calls for Northam's resignation continued.[91]\nCBS News also unearthed Northam's Virginia Military Institute yearbook, which listed \"Coonman\", a racial slur, as one of Northam's nicknames; Northam told reporters that two people referred to him by that name, and said that he regretted the presence of the nickname in his yearbook.[122] Northam says that he does not understand why that nickname was bestowed on him.[123][124]\nA months-long investigation into the photo that appeared in the 1984 Eastern Virginia Medical School yearbook could not “conclusively” determine who is in the photo or even how the image came to be there. A team hired by EVMS released a 55-page report May 22, 2019, saying: “We could not conclusively determine the identity of either individual depicted in the photograph.” McGuireWoods contacted over 80 people connected to the school, including five members of their yearbook staff at the time.[125]\nDespite the yearbook scandal, as well as those surrounding Virginia's other two elected statewide officials: Lieutenant Governor Justin Fairfax and state Attorney General Mark Herring, the Democratic Party of Virginia won control of both the Virginia Senate and the Virginia House of Representatives in the statewide elections that November, amid some predictions that the scandals could negatively impact Democratic success in the coming elections.[126]\nFacing widespread calls for his resignation, Northam chose to remain in office but made a public commitment to focus the remainder of his gubernatorial term on addressing Virginia's racial inequities.[127][128][129] He and his cabinet then joined with the Virginia Legislative Black Caucus to develop strategies for closing the racial disparity in Virginia's maternal mortality rate, increasing affordable housing and funding for public transportation, supporting minority-owned businesses, removing Confederate monuments from public spaces, removing racist remnants of the Jim Crow era from state lawbooks, rethinking the state's approach to how African American history is taught in public schools, and establishing sensitivity training for state agencies.[127][130]\nOn March 22, 2019, Northam signed a bill, introduced by the chairman of Virginia's Legislative Black Caucus, Lamont Bagby, establishing the Virginia African American Advisory Board; this board is designed to consist of twenty-one non-legislative citizens appointed by the governor, at least fifteen of whom must be black; additionally, the board includes five members of the governor's cabinet.[a] The board's purpose is to advise the governor on how to best serve African Americans living in the state. Comparable boards for the state's Latino and Asian communities had already existed, and Bagby called the African American Advisory Board \"far overdue\". Upon establishing the board, Northam said that it would \"ensure the voices of all Virginians are heard, particularly those from underrepresented and historically disenfranchised communities.\"[132][133]\nIn May of that year, Northam announced his intent to establish a new cabinet-level position, Chief Diversity Officer. This position would be responsible for advancing equity and inclusion throughout the state government's operations.[134][135][136] Virginia is considered to be the first state in the country to establish such a position at the cabinet-level.[135][136] On September 9, Northam named Janice Underwood as the inaugural Chief Diversity Officer. Underwood had previously led diversity initiatives at Old Dominion University.[135][137] Among the issues that Underwood has focused on as Chief Diversity Officer are supporting small businesses owned by women, minorities, and disabled veterans, reducing inequities in health care, and diversifying employment in the state's public and private sectors.[138]\nOn March 12, 2020, Northam declared a state of emergency in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. At the time, there were seventeen known cases of the virus in Virginia. On March 13, Northam closed all Virginia schools, and on March 15, he imposed statewide restrictions to allow no more than 100 people at public gatherings. On the seventeenth, he set even stricter limits on public gatherings, allowing no more than ten people together in most areas; grocery and retail stores, pharmacies, medical facilities, manufacturing plants and distribution centers, and transportation hubs were all exempted from the gathering limit.[139]\nAlthough schools were originally scheduled to reopen in Virginia after two weeks, on March 23, Northam extended their closure for the remainder of the school year. At this time, there were over 250 known cases of COVID-19 in the state. On April 6, Northam began encouraging the use of face masks by those occupying public spaces. On May 26, he announced a statewide policy requiring the use of facemasks in public indoor spaces. By the end of 2020, over 4,800 Virginians were confirmed dead due to the virus.[139]\nThe pandemic prompted Northam in March 2020 to request that the Supreme Court of Virginia issue a moratorium against evictions. One was subsequently issued but expired in June. Northam then requested that the moratorium be extended and the court agreed to do so in August. In July, after the initial moratorium had lapsed, eviction cases were opened throughout the state, and those cases continued to proceed even after the moratorium was extended in August.[140][141][142]\nThe extended moratorium expired September 7. The Supreme Court of Virginia denied Northam's request for a second extension of the moratorium but declared that a federal moratorium against evictions had to be recognized in Virginia. The federal moratorium – which was set to expire at the end of the year, but was later extended into 2021 – only applied to tenants earning less than a certain amount, who were struggling financially and at risk of exposure to COVID-19 if evicted.[142][143][144]\nAccording to The Washington Post, thousands of evictions continued to be filed in Virginia under the federal moratorium \"because of the state's loose interpretation of the order.\"[145] Its limitations led Northam to consider the federal moratorium to be insufficient protection for those facing the possibility of eviction.[142]\nHousing advocates pressed Northam throughout 2020 to issue an executive order banning evictions in Virginia for the duration of the pandemic. Northam demurred, suggesting that such an order would have been susceptible to legal challenges.[140][141][142] On November 18, he instead amended the state budget to implement a temporary statewide ban on evictions in most circumstances; under the ban, which lasted through the end of 2020, tenants could only be evicted for failure to pay rent if they refused to pursue rent relief programs; the ban also required that landlords provide written notice of state and local rent relief programs to any tenants who failed to pay rent. Once the ban expired at the end of 2020, Northam's amended state budget provided for several new tenant protections to take its place at the start of 2021; these protections allow landlords to evict tenants for failure to pay rent only after the landlords have applied for rental assistance on behalf of the tenants, require landlords who own more than four rental units to offer payment plans to tenants who have been impacted by COVID-19, and extend the amount of notice tenants must be given before eviction from five days to fourteen.[143][144][146][147][148]\nThe tenant protections enacted through the state budget did not prevent evictions from continuing in Virginia for reasons other than failure to pay rent, nor did they prevent landlords in the state from denying lease renewals to tenants eligible for rental assistance.[149][150] Although many of the protections from the state budget expired at the end of June 2021,[151][152] they were renewed in August through June 2022.[153][154]\nAbout one-fifth as many evictions were filed in Virginia throughout the first half of 2021 as had been normal for the state before the pandemic. At the start of Northam's term, Virginia had one of the nation's highest eviction rates, and efforts to reduce that rate had already begun under Northam prior to the pandemic.[155][156]\nThe rent relief program that Virginia established in response to the pandemic was among the first in the nation.[153][156] Initially funded by the state alone, the program received additional funding from the federal government in January 2021.[156] Since then, Virginia's rent relief program has distributed a higher percentage of its federal funding than has been distributed by any other state for this purpose and is second only to Texas in the total amount of federal funding that it has distributed.[155][156][157][158] The policy that Northam enacted through the state budget requiring that landlords apply for rent relief on behalf of their tenants before they can file evictions for nonpayment was credited by The Virginian-Pilot as a primary reason for Virginia's effective distribution of rent relief and was credited by The Washington Post as a primary reason for the state's achievement of a low eviction rate in 2021.[155][159] The Christian Science Monitor wrote that during Northam's tenure in office, Virginia became a \"national model\" for tenant protections.[156]\nIn September 2020, Northam asked the State Corporation Commission to extend its moratorium on utility cutoffs, which had first been implemented in March. The commission agreed to extend the moratorium until October 5.[160][161] Northam then asked for a further extension in October, which the commission denied.[162] On November 18, Northam reimplemented the moratorium through an amendment to the state budget. Although when implemented by the commission, the moratorium had applied only to private utility companies, the version implemented through the state budget applied to all utilities, including those operated by local and regional governments. The state government was able to grant exemptions from this moratorium to utilities that were at risk of insolvency. Under reforms introduced through the state budget, customers who are unable to pay their utility bills for more thirty days during the pandemic are ensured access to payment plans.[146][147]\nThe moratorium expired in August 2021. That same month, Northam and the Virginia legislature implemented a new moratorium protecting financially vulnerable residential customers of the state's largest utility provider, Dominion Energy. This moratorium will continue until March 2022. For residential customers of the state's other utility providers, funds from the American Rescue Plan Act have been made available to assist those who have been unable to pay their bills for over sixty days. [163][164][165] The requirement that utility customers be offered payment plans has also remained in effect.[164]\nIn May 2020, Northam instructed the Virginia Department of Labor and Industry to develop new workforce safety standards in response to the pandemic.[166] The department's Board of Safety and Health Codes voted on June 24 and July 15 to make those standards mandatory statewide. The federal government under President Trump had previously issued safety standards to guide employers during the pandemic but had not made those guidelines mandatory. Virginia was the first state in the nation to adopt mandatory workforce safety standards in response to the pandemic.[167][168][169][170] These standards were set to expire at the end of January 2021,[171] but were extended indefinitely that same month.[172][173]\nIn March 2020, Northam urged localities to reduce their jail populations, so as to lessen the spread of COVID-19 among inmates, and in April, he proposed an amendment to the state budget that would allow the Virginia Department of Corrections to release non-dangerous inmates with remaining sentences of one year or less. This amendment was passed by the Virginia legislature on April 22. It marks the first time that the Virginia Department of Corrections has ever held authority to release inmates early. The policy is set to remain in effect until July 2021. To qualify for the policy, inmates are required to have a place to stay upon release.[174][175][176][177] An algorithm-calculated recidivism rate is also used to determine whether an inmate qualifies for release under the policy.[178][179]\nSome political activists have called the policy overly narrow and have suggested that Northam should further reduce Virginia's prison population through issuing clemency to certain inmates.[177][180][181][182] Northam and the Department of Corrections have faced multiple lawsuits from inmates who claim to be at risk of contracting COVID-19.[177][183] In May, a settlement was reached in one of those lawsuits.[178][184][185][186] Subsequently, the ACLU argued that the Virginia Department of Corrections had proceeded to violate the terms of that settlement multiple times.[178][180][187][188] In July, the Marshall Project reported that Virginia's prison population had decreased by the smallest amount of any state in the nation during the pandemic.[178][180][189]\nIn July 2020, when an outbreak of COVID-19 occurred at the Farmville Detention Center, Northam's administration responded by twice offering to have the Virginia Department of Health help conduct testing at the facility. Those offers were then declined for undisclosed reasons. Because ICE facilities are not operated by the Virginia government, Northam reasoned that he was unable to unilaterally intervene in the situation – a conclusion that some immigration advocates have disputed. Before the outbreak, Northam had unsuccessfully urged the Trump administration to conduct point prevalence testing at ICE facilities, and soon after the outbreak, Northam joined with Virginia senators Mark Warner and Tim Kaine in calling on the Trump administration to intervene at the Farmville facility. In a letter to President Trump, Northam requested that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) dispatch a team to address the situation.[190]\nThat summer, it was reported that over 260 of the Farmville Detention Center's estimated 400 detainees had contracted COVID-19.[190][191][192] According to ICE, most of those infected at the facility were asymptomatic, although the detainees themselves and their lawyers claimed that many detainees at the facility developed symptoms.[190][193] In August, The Washington Post wrote that the Farmville facility had what was at the time \"the nation's largest coronavirus outbreak inside a detention center.\"[191] In September, the same publication reported that over 330 detainees at the facility had been infected during the outbreak.[194]\nShortly before the start of the outbreak, seventy-four undocumented immigrants had been transferred to the Farmville Detention Center from facilities in Arizona and Florida. These detainees were neither tested nor quarantined prior to arriving at the Farmville facility, even though they were transferred from facilities where COVID-19 had already occurred. A lawsuit filed in July on behalf of detainees at the Farmville facility argued that the Farmville Detention Center had violated its own policy when the transferred detainees were not quarantined.[b] The lawsuit further argued that crowded conditions, poor ventilation, infrequent testing, and insufficient medical treatment had contributed to the outbreak, while detailing the use of pepper spray and solitary confinement on detainees who protested these conditions.[190][191][195]\nPer Northam's request, a CDC team conducted a week-long evaluation of the Farmville Detention Center in August.[196][197] Although the team described failures to observe CDC guidelines at the facility as minimal, it faulted staff members for wearing masks inconsistently and for not always isolating after developing symptoms associated with COVID-19. It also expressed concern that the layout of the facility made physical distancing impractical in certain areas. Citing these findings, a federal judge ordered a new inspection of the facility later that same month.[197] This new inspection found that the facility had managed to adopt physical distancing procedures but faulted the facility for not always isolating symptomatic detainees. It also faulted some detainees for not wearing masks.[194] The Washington Post later reported on the conditions at the facility in greater detail, explaining that most infected detainees remained in their regular dorm rooms during the outbreak because there were only nine medical isolation rooms in the facility.[195] The publication further reported that staffers at the facility continued to work during the outbreak \"through nausea, diarrhea and breathlessness\" and were allegedly asked to work even after testing positive for COVID-19.[195] Several detainees at the facility abandoned their asylum cases and asked to be deported so as to escape the outbreak. At least one of them was killed soon after returning to his home country.[195]\nIn early August, a Canadian national detained at the Farmville Detention Center died of COVID-19 shortly before he was to be deported.[194][195][198] A few days later, a federal judge ordered the Farmville facility to stop admitting new detainees.[195][199] Later that month, the outbreak ended.[195]\nIn September, an official from the Department of Homeland Security stated that the detainees from Arizona and Florida had been transferred to the Farmville Detention Center as an excuse to transport Special Response Teams on charter flights to Washington D.C., where the teams were then used over the summer to suppress that city's George Floyd protests. A former ICE official has corroborated this claim. Although moving weapons and equipment is easier for ICE employees on charter flights than it is on commercial flights, ICE employees are only allowed to travel on charter flights when accompanied by detainees. The decision to transfer detainees to the Farmville Detention Center so that Special Response Teams could travel on charter flights has been described by multiple officials from the Department of Homeland Security as an abuse of the ICE charter flight policy. Although ICE claimed that the detainees had been transferred from facilities that were near capacity, official records reviewed by The Washington Post show that the Arizona and Florida facilities were not actually near capacity when the transfers occurred. The Farmville facility's own capacity before accepting the transferred detainees was already much higher than the capacities of many other detention centers around the country.[194]\nFrom September through December 2020, the only other immigration detention center in Virginia, the Caroline Detention Facility, experienced smaller outbreaks of COVID-19.[200][201][202][203] On October 21, in response to the outbreaks at both the Farmville and Caroline facilities, Northam signed a bill granting the Virginia state government permanent authority to conduct both health inspections and wrongful death investigations at detention facilities in the state.[202][203][204]\nOn October 8, 2020, a federal indictment against six men associated with the Wolverine Watchmen, a Michigan-based militia group, was unsealed. The indictment charges the men with plotting to kidnap Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer and violently overthrow Michigan's government.[205] During a court hearing on October 13, an FBI agent testified that the suspects had also discussed kidnapping Northam in response to his mitigation measures against COVID-19.[206][207]\nThe Washington Post described Northam as a moderate state senator who moved to the left on some issues during the 2017 gubernatorial Democratic primary, such as support for a $15 minimum wage and opposition to a state constitutional amendment enshrining right-to-work legislation.[208]\nNortham supports abortion rights.[209] As a Virginia state senator, he opposed a bill to mandate vaginal ultrasounds for women seeking abortions, and voted against the bill when it was revised to mandate only abdominal ultrasounds.[210] He was endorsed in the 2017 Democratic gubernatorial primary by the abortion rights group NARAL and its Virginia affiliate.[211] Northam has argued for reducing abortion rates through education and expanding access to contraceptives.[209] Planned Parenthood pledged to spend $3 million supporting Northam in his 2017 general election campaign for governor.[212] Northam opposes banning abortions after 20 weeks through a state version of the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act.[213]\nFor third-trimester abortions, Northam supports Virginia's current law requiring certification by multiple physicians.[214][215][c] During a January 2019 radio interview, Northam said that third-trimester abortions may be done in cases of a non-viable fetus or severe deformity. If a delivery occurred in such cases, Northam further stated that, \"The infant would be resuscitated if that's what the mother and the family desired, and then a discussion would ensue between the physicians and the mother.\"[214][217][218] This statement drew intense criticism from Republican politicians nationwide, many of whom accused Northam of supporting infanticide.[94][95][219][d] Northam's office refuted such criticism as a mischaracterization of his comments.[220][221]\nAs a state senator, Northam introduced a bill to ban the use of gas chambers on companion animals in Virginia, addressing a means of euthanasia that has been described by medical experts as less humane than lethal injection.[222][223] The ban was signed into law by Tim Kaine in 2008.[222][224] During Virginia's 2017 gubernatorial election, Northam was endorsed by both the Humane Society Legislative Fund[225] and Humane Dominion.[222] In its endorsement, the former organization stated, \"In addition to advancing statewide animal protection policy, Northam has demonstrated concern for animals in his personal life, growing up on a farm and understanding the importance of proper animal care.\"[225]\nIn 2018, Northam signed a law requiring that products developed in Virginia use non-animal based testing methods whenever possible; when such methods are not possible, the law requires that the number of animals used in testing be minimized and that the most humane testing method be used. The law exempts testing done for medical research. It also allows animal testing to be conducted whenever required by federal or state agencies. This law made Virginia the fourth state to restrict animal based product testing.[226][227][228][229]\nThat same year, Northam signed a law banning state-funded, medically unnecessary experiments in Virginia that induce unalleviated pain in cats or dogs; this law, which defines \"medically unnecessary\" experiments as those not done for the benefit of the animal test subjects, is the first of its kind in the United States and passed with unanimous support in the Virginia state legislature.[230][231][232][233][234][235][236][237]\nIn 2019, Northam signed a law classifying the physical abuse of cats and dogs as a felony in Virginia; previously, such abuse had been classified as a misdemeanor in Virginia, unless it resulted in an animal's death;[238][239][240] it was not until later that year that federal law made abuse against all kinds of mammals, birds, amphibians, and reptiles a federal felony.[241][242][243][244] That same year, Northam vetoed a bill that would have established a mandatory minimum sentence of six months for the killing or injuring of a police animal.[245][246][247] Noting that Virginia law already classified violence against police animals as a felony, Northam explained his veto by arguing against the value of mandatory minimum sentences and stating, \"While violence is unacceptable, these are crimes that can be addressed by a judge with full knowledge of the facts and circumstances of each particular case.\"[245][246]\nAdditional animal welfare bills signed by Northam in 2019 add requirements for the proper sheltering and tethering of animals and provide animal control officers the authority to confiscate tethered roosters that have been involved in cockfighting.[238][248] Prior to 2019, tethers used on pets[e] were required by Virginia law to be at least three times the animal's length; the law signed by Northam in 2019 changes this to at least ten feet or three times the animal's length, whichever is greater.[238][248][250] In 2020, Northam signed a law revising this to fifteen feet or four times the animal's length, whichever is greater. The 2020 law allows the 2019 standard to be enforced when an animal control officer determines that a shorter tether would be preferable.[249][251][252][253][254] The 2019 law also established that tethers must weigh no more than one-tenth the animal's body weight, cannot be weighed down, and cannot be painful.[238][248][250] The 2019 law regarding the proper sheltering of animals requires protection from hot and cold weather.[238][248][255] In 2020, Northam signed a law banning the tethering of animals in extreme weather or temperatures (except for when an animal control officer determines that a tethered animal can safely tolerate such conditions); this law also requires that tethered animals be safe from predators.[249][251][252][253][254]\nA bill signed by Northam in 2020 tasked the Virginia Board of Agriculture and Consumer Services with establishing new state regulations for pet stores. To enforce those regulations, the bill created the position of State Animal Welfare Inspector.[256][257][258] Northam proposed an unsuccessful amendment to this bill; his amendment would have expanded the state government's definition of a commercial dog breeder to include any person who breeds dogs for research purposes.[259][260][261] This amendment was proposed following revelations of poor conditions at a breeding facility in Cumberland, Virginia. Housing thousands of beagles bred for research purposes, the Cumberland facility is the largest of its kind in the state and would have faced increased regulation had Northam's amendment been enacted. Although widely supported among animal rights organizations, such as PETA and the Humane Society of the United States, Northam's amendment was opposed by the bill's sponsor, David W. Marsden, who claimed that the amendment could potentially cause the Cumberland facility to close.[259][260][262] Northam agreed to rescind his support for the amendment, while Marsden expressed a desire to implement a revised approach to the amendment's goals in 2021.[260]\nAdditional animal welfare bills signed by Northam in 2020 ban dealers and commercial breeders in Virginia from selling or importing any dog bred by any person who has committed certain violations of the Animal Welfare Act;[263][264][265] ban any sale or loan in which a default could result in the repossession of any cat or dog;[264][266] ban any hunt that guarantees the killing of a deer, bear, or wild turkey;[267][268][269][270] ban any contact between the public and certain types of dangerous animals in captivity;[271][272][273] limit the circumstances in which any cat or dog is allowed to be leased or rented;[264][266] and establish more detailed standards for animal shelters.[264][274] The law banning public contact with dangerous animals applies to any bear, cougar, jaguar, leopard,[f] lion, nonhuman primate, tiger, or hybrid of such animals; as first written, the bill would have applied to elephants as well, but before the bill passed, it was revised to exclude elephants.[271][273][275]\nOn March 8, 2019, Northam signed a bill repealing a minimum wage exemption that had applied to several jobs historically associated with black workers; a remnant of the Jim Crow era, the exemption had applied to shoe-shiners, ushers, doormen, concession attendants, and theater cashiers.[276][277][278] A month before signing this bill, Northam had faced scandals over racist content found in his college and medical school yearbooks and responded to calls for his resignation by pledging to prioritize racial justice issues throughout the remainder of his term in office.[127] On June 4 of that year, he announced plans to continue repealing all discriminatory state laws that had been passed during the Jim Crow era. To identify those laws, he established the Commission to Examine Racial Inequity in Virginia Law, which formed with nine members on September 3.[276][279][280] The commission was assisted by students from Virginia Commonwealth University, the University of Richmond School of Law, and the University of Virginia School of Law.[280] On December 5, the commission issued a report recommending the repeal of 98 laws, most of which had already become legally unenforceable.[280][281][282] The commission stated, \"Though most of these pieces of legislation are outdated and have no legal effect, they remain enshrined in law. The Commission believes that such vestiges of Virginia's segregationist past should no longer have official status.\"[280]\nAmong the laws identified in the 2019 report were a ban on interracial marriage, a requirement that spouses be identified by race on marriage licenses,[g] policies that had been enacted to prevent school integration, requirements that neighborhoods, trains, playgrounds, and steamboats be racially segregated, and a poll tax.[280][281][287] These laws were repealed in a bipartisan package of bills signed by Northam on April 11, 2020.[288][289]\nOn June 11 of that year, Northam authorized the commission to enter a new phase of research; this phase is focused on identifying modern laws and regulations that have contributed to social inequities in Virginia. The commission will also devise policies to remedy those inequities.[290] Chief Deputy Attorney General of Virginia Cynthia Hudson, who chairs the commission, said about this second phase of work, \"it's certainly not my expectation to find the expressly racist language and intent that we found in the Acts of Assembly from generations ago. So, the nature of the work will turn to trying to discern what the impact is from an equity perspective of current law that might not on its face appear discriminatory, but in its effect, disproportionately impacts people of color and other under-represented communities.\"[282] Northam also signed legislation in 2020 establishing a separate commission tasked with studying the impacts of slavery and discrimination in Virginia.[288][291]\nOn March 4, 2020, Northam signed a bill making Virginia the fourth US state and first southern state to ban racial hair discrimination.[292] The bill passed with unanimous support in the state senate. Upon signing the bill, Northam remarked, \"It's pretty simple - if we send children home from school because their hair looks a certain way, or otherwise ban certain hairstyles associated with a particular race - that is discrimination. This is not only unacceptable and wrong, it is not what we stand for in Virginia.\"[293][294][295]\nOn April 11 of the same year, Northam signed the bipartisan Virginia Values Act, which applies anti-discrimination protections to public accommodations. Prior to the bill, Virginia had been one of five US states that did not have any such protections.[296] The Virginia Values Act also updated Virginia's existing anti-discrimination laws to add protections on the bases of gender identity, sexual orientation, and veteran's status.[297][298]\nAn additional civil rights bill signed by Northam in 2020 established a process for the removal of racially exclusionary housing covenants from property deeds in Virginia; these covenants had been widely adopted throughout the United States in the early-twentieth century for the purpose of banning racial minorities from living in certain areas. Although all such covenants had become legally unenforceable in the 1960s, little had been done by 2020 to purge the covenants from official legal records. The bill signed by Northam in 2020 allows property owners to have the covenants removed without the need of an attorney.[299][300][301]\nLater in the year, during a special legislative session largely devoted to racial justice issues, Northam signed a bill making it a hate crime in Virginia for someone motivated by bias to make a false report to law enforcement.[302]\nOn the controversies over public monuments to the Confederacy, in June 2017 Northam stated that the statues in the state Capitol that the General Assembly has jurisdiction over \"should be taken down and moved into museums\", and that the decision on other statues \"belongs to local communities.\"[25] He has said that there should be more public memorials to historical Virginia civil rights leaders such as Barbara Rose Johns, Oliver Hill, and Samuel Wilbert Tucker.[25] In August 2017, Northam took a firmer stance, saying, \"I believe these statues should be taken down and moved into museums. As governor, I am going to be a vocal advocate for that approach and work with localities on this issue.\"[303] Northam later reverted to his original stance that decisions on the monuments should be made locally.[304][305]\nIn early June 2020, Northam announced the removal of Robert E. Lee Monument on Richmond's Monument Avenue in response to Black Lives Matter protests after the murder of George Floyd.[306]\nAfter Northam was elected governor, The Washington Post identified an opportunity for bipartisan legislation in raising Virginia's felony larceny threshold.[307] Set at $200, the threshold was then tied with New Jersey for lowest in the nation.[66][308] The threshold's value had not been raised since 1980, and had it kept pace with inflation, would have been equal to around $600 in 2017.[309] Outgoing governor Terry McAuliffe attempted during his final year in office to raise the threshold's value to $500 but was unable to advance such a proposal through the legislature.[310][311] During Virginia's 2017 gubernatorial campaign, Northam's opponent, Ed Gillespie, voiced support for the $500 threshold,[312] while both Northam and McAuliffe called for the threshold to be raised even further to $1,000,[308][309] a value more closely aligned with the thresholds used in a majority of other states.[309]\nIn February 2018, about a month after his inauguration as governor, Northam struck a deal with the Republican-controlled legislature to raise the felony threshold to $500; in exchange, Northam gave support to Republican-sponsored legislation that would require criminal defendants seeking parole to first pay full restitution to victims.[309][313] McAuliffe had vetoed a comparable restitution bill the previous year. The Washington Post's editorial board called Northam's compromise \"a small step toward fairer justice in Virginia\", but voiced concern that the restitution bill would place an onerous burden on poor defendants; the editorial board also noted that the $500 threshold would still be one of the country's lowest and, when adjusted for inflation, under the level that had been set in 1980.[313]\nOn March 4, 2020, after Democrats won control of the Virginia state legislature, Northam signed a bill raising the felony larceny threshold to $1000.[314][315][316] The Roanoke Times described this action as fulfilling one of Northam's \"criminal justice reform priorities\".[315] Upon signing the bill, Northam said, \"While we will continue to hold people accountable for their actions, it's important that the punishment fit the crime. This bill will bring Virginia in line with the majority of states in our country, modernizing our law to ensure that one mistake does not define a person's entire life.\"[316]\nDuring their respective gubernatorial campaigns, Northam and his opponent, Ed Gillespie, both criticized Virginia's practice of suspending driver's licenses for unpaid court-ordered fines and fees.[312][317][318] Northam campaigned on an official end to this practice, while Gillespie wanted to \"functionally end\" the practice through the use of payment plans.[312][h] In the year Northam was elected governor, the Legal Aid Justice Center estimated that Virginia's policy of suspending driver's licenses for unmade payments had impacted around one million people.[325][326] At that time, Virginia was facing a class action lawsuit over this issue.[327]\nWhile advocating for a repeal of the practice, Northam remarked, \"Often, people don't pay court costs because they can't afford it. Suspending their license for these unpaid fees makes it that much harder on them.\"[328] He argued that a repeal would make it easier for people to pay their debt, noting that people who are prevented from legally driving struggle to earn an income.[329] Although The Washington Post noted that similar policies were facing scrutiny at that time throughout much of the United States,[322][328] the publication also wrote that Virginia's policy was among the strictest in the nation, as Virginia was one of the few states where the debt-based suspension of driver's licenses was not limited to cases in which money was owed due to traffic violations.[330]\nIn January 2019, the Virginia state Senate passed a bill that would have repealed the penalty of suspending driver's licenses for unpaid debt, but that February, a Republican-controlled subcommittee in the House of Delegates defeated the bill.[331][332] In March of that year, a repeal of this penalty was included by Northam as an amendment to the state budget.[333] The penalty could not be fully repealed by the budget. Instead, the budget was able to pause the penalty for one year.[334][329] Virginia's legislature adopted Northam's proposed budget amendment, which also reinstated driver's licenses that had been suspended solely for unpaid debt.[335][336]\nThis occurred in the wake of a commitment from Northam to focus the remainder of his tenure on combating racial inequities in Virginia.[333] The Washington Post's editorial board found that Virginia's debt-based suspension of driver's licenses disproportionately impacted minorities and described the repeal of this policy as a priority for the state's Legislative Black Caucus.[337][338] While developing that year's state budget, Northam was embroiled in scandals concerning racist content found in his college and medical school yearbooks. Explaining how the criticism he had faced over these scandals was informing his approach to the state budget, Northam said, \"There's a level of awareness regarding race inequities in Virginia that we have never seen - that I have never seen in my lifetime. I am going to do everything...to really bring some good from the events that happened six weeks ago...Actions speak louder than words, and now is our opportunity over the next three years to really take action.\"[333]\nIn April 2020, after Virginia's General Assembly came under Democratic control and before the above-mentioned budget amendment was set to expire, Northam signed a bipartisan bill making the effects of the amendment permanent.[339][340][341] That same month, Northam signed separate legislation ending the suspension of driver's licenses in Virginia both for non-driving related drug offenses and for theft of motor fuel.[342][339][343] He also repealed a mandatory minimum sentence of ten days that Virginia had been imposing on third or subsequent convictions of driving with a suspended license.[344][345][346] Virginia was among the first US states to end the practice of suspending driver's licenses for outstanding debt[339][344] but was the 45th state to end the practice of suspending driver's licenses for non-driving related drug offenses.[343]\nDuring Virginia's 2020 legislative session, there was discussion among the General Assembly's newly Democratic majority about the possibility of fully reinstating parole, which had been abolished by the state in 1995 under then-governor George Allen.[347][348][349] Only prisoners sentenced before 1995 or under a youthful offender statute[i] remained eligible for parole after the enactment of the 1995 ban, unless they qualified for geriatric parole, which was not abolished.[350][351][352]\nNortham's administration argued that Virginia's parole ban had exacerbated the state's racial inequities, led to an increase in elderly inmates receiving costly medical care at the state's expense, and strained the state's prison capacities.[348] A full repeal of the ban was not approved in 2020, although legislation signed by Northam that year reinstated parole in limited circumstances.[353][354]\nOne of these circumstances addressed certain prisoners sentenced during the first five years of the parole ban.[348][355] Before the 2000 state Supreme Court case Fishback v. Commonwealth ruled that juries in Virginia must be informed of the state's parole ban, many juries in Virginia had been unaware of the ban.[j] Prisoners sentenced by these uninformed juries came to be known as the \"Fishback inmates\".[357][358][359] Virginia remained at the time one of the few states where juries could determine sentencing, and in some cases, an uncorrected misconception among juries that parole still existed in Virginia increased the length of sentences imposed on these inmates.[354][356][357] As the court's ruling in Fishback v. Commonwealth had no effect on already imposed sentences, it granted no relief to the Fishback inmates.[354][356][359] After Northam took office, it was estimated that around 300 of these inmates remained imprisoned, a small portion of them for non-violent felonies.[357][358][360]\nAn effort to extend parole eligibility to the Fishback inmates was undertaken by Northam's gubernatorial predecessor, Terry McAuliffe, but McAuliffe was unable to earn support for such a measure in the state's legislature.[356][357][361] Northam continued that effort unsuccessfully for the first two years of his own governorship[357] before achieving results in 2020.[354][359][362] Under reform signed by Northam that year, all Fishback inmates still incarcerated became eligible for parole, except for those who had been convicted of a Class 1 felony or the sexual abuse of a minor.[358][362][363] By the time Northam signed this bill, the cause of the Fishback inmates had largely won favor among prosecutors in Virginia, according to the Association of Commonwealth's Attorneys.[358] In April of that year, responding to the COVID-19 health pandemic, the Virginia General Assembly adopted an \"emergency clause\" amendment proposed by Northam to grant parole eligibility to Fishback inmates immediately; new bills are usually enacted on July 1 of each year.[364][365][366]\nAnother piece of parole reform enacted by Northam in 2020 concentrates on juvenile offenders.[348][359][367] At the start of Northam's governorship, Virginia law denied parole eligibility to nearly all juvenile offenders sentenced as adults after 1995.[350][367][368] Only those sentenced under a youthful offender statute still qualified.[350] This put Virginia in conflict with the 2012 U.S. Supreme Court decision in Miller v. Alabama, which ruled that mandatory life sentences without the possibility of parole are an unconstitutional penalty for juvenile offenders. By 2020, several other states had already adjusted their laws to be compliant with Miller.[350][367][368] Virginia's refusal to do so before 2020 led The Washington Post's editorial board to write that Virginia had failed during the preceding years to respect the decision.[367] On February 24, 2020, Northam signed bipartisan legislation making all Virginia inmates convicted as juveniles eligible for parole after serving twenty years of their sentences.[359][367] This made Virginia the 23rd state to prohibit life sentences without the possibility of parole for juvenile offenders.[367][368]\nA plan to expand geriatric release was also included in Northam's 2020 agenda for criminal justice reform.[352][369][370][371] Under Virginia law, only prisoners older than sixty who have served at least ten years of their sentences or those older than sixty-five who have served at least five years of their sentences qualify for geriatric release.[348][362][372] In 2020, Virginia's legislature considered, but did not pass, a bill backed by Northam that would have created two additional categories of inmates eligible for geriatric release: those older than fifty-five who have served at least fifteen years of their sentences and those older than fifty who have served at least twenty years of their sentences.[348][362][369][371]\nBefore 2020, the parole board of Virginia could not use terminal illness as a reason to release inmates, although it could advise the governor on offering Executive Medical Clemency to certain inmates estimated to have less than three months to live.[371][372][373] This compassionate release policy for terminally ill inmates was the second most restrictive in the country,[k] and Virginia remains the only state that does not tailor any form of early release to inmates with complex, nonterminal illnesses or permanent disabilities.[353][371][373] A bill to establish parole for inmates who are terminally ill or permanently incapacitated was supported by Northam during Virginia's regular legislative session for 2020[352][369][370] and passed in the state Senate[348] but was not passed in the House of Delegates.[353] Later in the year, Northam called a special legislative session partially devoted to criminal justice reform, and during this session, on October 28, he signed a bill allowing the parole board to grant conditional release to terminally ill inmates estimated to have less than twelve months to live; the bill largely excludes inmates convicted of violent crimes.[374][375][302][376]\nAlthough early in his governorship, Northam signed a bill imposing a new mandatory minimum sentence of life in prison for those convicted of murdering a police officer, in May 2019, he vowed not to sign any further legislation imposing mandatory minimum sentences. In an op-ed for The Washington Post, he argued that such legislation is racially discriminatory and leads to over-incarceration.[245][246][247]\nA year later, Northam signed a law exempting juveniles tried as adults in Virginia from mandatory minimum sentences.[377][378][379] That same year, he enacted further reform for juveniles in the Virginia justice system by signing a bill that requires judicial approval for anyone under the age of sixteen to be tried as an adult; Virginia law had previously given prosecutors the discretion to charge anyone fourteen years or older as an adult.[339][342][355][380]\nIn December 2019, Northam directed the Virginia Department of Corrections to suspend a policy that had allowed strip-searches to be performed on minors during prison visitations.[381][382] In April 2020, he signed legislation making the suspension of that policy permanent and barring prisons from threatening permanent bans on visitors who refuse to be strip searched.[383][384][385][386] Although it had already been against the policy of the Virginia Department of Corrections to permanently ban visitors who refuse to be strip searched, there had been several instances of prisons threatening such bans.[383][384]\nAnother reform signed into law by Northam in 2020 allows judges to dismiss misdemeanor or non-violent felony charges against defendants with autism or an intellectual disability when the court determines that the defendant's criminal conduct was linked to such a disorder or disability and after the defendant has completed a period of probation.[387][388][389][390] That same year, Northam signed a bill tasking the Virginia Department of Corrections with developing accommodations for people with developmental disabilities.[387][391]\nTwo bills expanding credit programs for Virginia inmates were signed by Northam in 2020. The first of these allows Virginia inmates to pay fines and court costs with community service credits earned during incarceration. Virginia law had previously allowed these credits to be earned only before or after incarceration.[355][392][393] Northam signed the bill in March, saying that it would further prisoner rehabilitation and reintegration into society.[394][395][396]\nThe second of these bills increases the amount of sentence credits that inmates can earn toward early release.[397][398][399][400] When Virginia abolished parole in 1995, it did so as part of a larger \"truth in sentencing\" initiative that also capped at fifteen percent the amount of time inmates could earn off their sentences through good behavior.[348][401][402] The bill signed by Northam raises that cap, although only for certain inmates.[398][400][402][403] Those who qualify can have their sentences reduced by up to a third.[302][403] Deferred during Virginia's regular legislative session for 2020, the bill was passed and signed later that year, when Northam called a special session partially devoted to revisiting criminal justice reform.[398][401][404]\nDuring that same special session, Northam signed a bill allowing defendants convicted by juries in Virginia of non-capital offenses to have their sentences determined by judges. Prior to this bill, juries in Virginia were responsible for determining the sentences of anyone they convicted, and judges rarely exercised their ability to revise jury sentences. The bill signed by Northam gives anyone convicted by a jury in Virginia of a non-capital offense the option to choose between having their sentence determined by a jury or by a judge.[400][405][406][407][408][409]\nAt the time of this reform, Virginia had been the only state in the country, aside from Kentucky, where juries were required[l] to sentence anyone they convicted.[406][408] This requirement had been part of Virginia law for over two hundred years.[406][407][409] Most Virginia prosecutors opposed lifting the \nrequirement,[400][406] and the effort to do so failed during Virginia's regular legislative session for 2020,[405] before nearly failing again during the special session. Lifting this requirement was one of the highest priorities during Northam's tenure in office for Virginia's criminal justice reform advocates, who noted that jury sentences are usually much longer than sentences determined by judges and that consequently, before  jury sentencing was made optional in Virginia, defendants in the state often took plea deals to avoid jury sentences.[400][405][406][407][408][409]\nAnother bill signed by Northam during the 2020 special legislative session clarifies that prosecutors in Virginia are allowed to dismiss charges against defendants. This had previously been ambiguous under state law.[302][m]\nRalph Northam opposes the death penalty.[411] On 24 March 2021, he signed a law abolishing the death penalty in Virginia.[412]\nAnother reform enacted by Northam in 2020 eases the petition process for writs of actual innocence.[355][413][414] Through this process, which Virginia established in 2004, newly available evidence is examined, and if found exonerating by a court, the petitioner's criminal record is expunged. In its original form, this process was available almost exclusively to petitioners who had pleaded not guilty at trial; among those who had pleaded guilty, the process could be used only by a petitioner who had received a death sentence or whose conviction permitted a life sentence. Prior to the reform enacted under Northam, any failed petition that had been based on nonbiological evidence could not be followed by a new petition also based on nonbiological evidence, and any successful petition had to be found by a court to contain \"clear and convincing evidence\" that the petitioner had been wrongfully convicted.[415][416][417] Under legislation signed by Northam, anyone is allowed to petition for a writ of actual innocence, regardless of how the petitioner pleaded at trial, petitioners are allowed to pursue writs of actual innocence any number of times through the presentation of new evidence that is either biological or nonbiological, and for any petition to succeed, it need only to be supported by \"a preponderance of the evidence\".[415][416][417] By changing \"clear and convincing evidence\" to \"a preponderance of the evidence\", Virginia's standard for granting writs of actual innocence was lowered to conform with the standards employed by a majority of other states.[415][416] An additional bill reforming the writs of actual innocence unanimously passed the state legislature in 2020 and was signed by Northam: it allows private laboratories to test DNA evidence when the Virginia Department of Forensic Science is unable to do so.[418][419]\nIn 2020, Northam signed the Virginia Community Policing Act, which bans the practice of bias-based profiling by Virginia police officers and requires those officers to collect demographic information during all traffic stops or investigatory stops that occur in the state. This same law requires all law enforcement agencies in Virginia to collect the number of excessive force complaints that they receive and to report all of this information into a statewide database. Findings from the database are to be shared annually with the Governor, the Attorney General, and the General Assembly.[420][421][422][423][424][425]\nLater that year, Northam responded to the murder of George Floyd by convening a special legislative session largely devoted to criminal justice reform. During that session, Northam signed several bills enacting police reform in Virginia.[302] These bills banned the use of chokeholds by officers in all situations except for when it is \"immediately necessary to protect the law-enforcement officer or another person\",[374][302][426] introduced a requirement that officers must intervene when witnessing other officers engaged in excessive force,[374][302][426] made Virginia the third state - and the first since the killing of Breonna Taylor - to ban no-knock search warrants,[374][427][428][429] introduced requirements that officers be in uniform when serving search warrants and that most search warrants served at night receive authorization from a judge or magistrate,[430][431] banned officers from making traffic stops for various minor infractions or from conducting searches solely on the basis of smelling marijuana,[302][432] limited the forms of military equipment attainable by police departments, banned officers from having sexual relations with anyone in their custody,[302] established Virginia's first statewide code of conduct for officers and a statewide, standardized training curriculum for officers,[302] provided for the state-level decertification of officers who engage in misconduct,[302][433] granted the state Attorney General the power to conduct investigations of local police departments, granted localities the right to establish civilian review boards with subpoena and disciplinary powers, and created what is known as the MARCUS Alert system, which provides for mental health professionals to accompany police officers who are responding to mental health crises.[302]\nThe restrictions placed on warrants apply only to search warrants and not to arrest warrants.[431] The restrictions on traffic stops were enacted to reduce pretextual stops.[432] The state's standardized training curriculum includes a focus on racial bias, mental illness, de-escalation, and crisis intervention. The civilian review boards are optional for localities and have oversight of police departments but do not have oversight of sheriff's departments.[302][374]\nOn March 4, 2020, Northam signed legislation repealing three Virginia laws that courts had already ruled to be unconstitutional: a law prohibiting the possession, consumption, or purchase of alcohol by anyone that a court rules to be a \"habitual drunkard\";[434][435] a law prohibiting premarital sex;[434][436][437] and a law prohibiting the public use of profanity.[434][438][439] Although none of these laws were enforced with regularity by 2020, each of them continued to be enforced to some extent either until or nearly until they were repealed.[437][439][440][441] In the same year that Northam repealed these laws, he also repealed Virginia's unconstitutional Jim Crow laws, which by that time, had already been long unenforced.[280][288][442][443]\nVirginia's law regulating \"habitual drunkards\", first introduced in the 1870s, was enforced until 2019, when it was ruled unconstitutional by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.[435][440][444] Prior to that ruling, Virginia had been the only state aside from Utah suspending the drinking rights of people designated \"habitual drunkards\".[441][440][445] Virginia law still allows courts to suspend the drinking rights of individuals convicted of drunk driving.[446][447] The \"habitual drunkard\" designation had often been used to jail homeless people in Virginia.[440][444][445] Those who received this designation in Virginia and subsequently violated the associated restrictions placed upon them could face up to a year in jail and a maximum fine of $2,500.[440][444][446] These same penalties applied to anyone with the aforementioned designation who appeared publicly intoxicated.[434][435][445][n] In the final years before this law was overturned, it had been enforced primarily in Virginia Beach. The only other Virginia city that made significant use of the law in its final years had been Roanoke.[440][445][441]\nVirginia's law banning fornication was ruled unconstitutional by the Virginia Supreme Court in 2005.[436][450][451] At that time, CNN reported that the law \"had not been enforced criminally against a consenting adult since the middle of the 19th century\",[450] although in 2014, The Virginian-Pilot reported that small numbers of people continued to be convicted of fornication in Virginia even after the aforementioned 2005 ruling.[452] In 2020, Mark Levine, who introduced the bill to repeal the law, explained that 21st-century fornication charges generally resulted from plea deals or from instances in which the defendants were already charged with other crimes.[436][437][451]\nAccording to The Washington Post, Virginia's law banning public profanity dates back to at least 1860.[453] CNN dates the law even earlier, to the late eighteenth-century.[439] Although the U.S. Supreme Court ruled such laws unconstitutional in 1971,[439] Virginia's ban on public profanity continued to be enforced in rare instances up until the law was repealed in 2020.[438][439][453] Before this law was repealed, public profanity had been a misdemeanor in Virginia and carried a maximum fine of $250.[448][454][455][456] The same classification and penalty had applied to Virginia's ban on fornication.[434][436][457]\nNortham supports increasing Virginia's minimum wage, which at $7.25 an hour, has not surpassed the federally mandated level set in 2009.[458][459] While serving as lieutenant governor in 2014, Northam broke a tie in the Virginia state Senate, passing a bill that would have increased the state's minimum wage by increments.[458][460][461] Under the bill, the state's minimum wage would have settled at $9.25 an hour, after two years.[462] The measure was never enacted due to failing in the Virginia House of Delegates.[458][461][462] Three years later, as a gubernatorial candidate, Northam proposed that Virginia set its minimum wage at $15 an hour[o] and expressed plans to campaign as governor against Republican state legislators who continued to oppose a higher minimum wage.[458] Northam has pointed to the costliness of transportation in rural parts of the state to dispute the notion that a $15 minimum wage is too high for those areas.[463] During Northam's first year as governor, he vetoed a bill passed by the Republican-controlled legislature that would have banned localized minimum wages for government contractors.[464]\nDuring his 2017 campaign for governor, Northam was endorsed by the Laborers' International Union of North America; the union praised Northam for his opposition to a \"right-to-work\" amendment to the Virginia state constitution.[465] Northam criticized the repeal of the car tax under former Governor Jim Gilmore because of its impact on both K-12 and higher education, saying Virginia still has not recovered.[466]\nNortham \"has called for phasing out the grocery tax on low-income people and ending business taxes in struggling rural areas.\"[467] He has called for a bipartisan reform commission to make recommendations on state tax policy.[467][66]\nNortham supports funding public schools. Northam opposes publicly funding private schools.[66]\nIn August 2019, Northam established a commission to develop new guidelines for teaching African American History in Virginia. Explaining that his primary goal for the commission is to help Virginia students understand the ways that black oppression continued in America after slavery, Northam said, \"I think a lot of us need to understand that concept a lot better and this needs to start with the education of our children. Black oppression is alive and well today, it's just in a different form.\"[468]\nWhile campaigning for governor, Northam proposed a plan for Virginia to offer free community college and workforce training to students in high-demand fields who commit to a period of public service.[469][470][318] Northam has called this plan \"Get Skilled, Get a Job, Give Back\", or \"G3\" for short, and as governor, he has included G3 as part of his two-year budget proposal, which will be considered in the 2020 legislative session.[471]\nFor students participating in G3, the state of Virginia would cover educational expenses that remain after other forms of financial aid have been used; as such, G3 has been described as a \"last-dollar\" program.[469][471] It would only be available to students from low-income and middle-income households; the estimated cut-off would be about 400% of the federal poverty level, although this could vary depending upon a household's overall ability to afford costs. While participating in G3, students would have to maintain at least a 2.0 GPA and would be required to have a three-year graduation plan. Only students eligible for in-state tuition would qualify for the program.[471][472] According to Inside Higher Ed and The Free Lance-Star, G3 is one of the few free tuition programs in the United States available to students of all ages.[473][474] Returning students, part-time students, and dual enrollment students are all allowed to participate in the program.[473][474][475]\nUnder G3, the cost of tuition, fees, and books would all be covered, and students receiving Pell Grants would qualify for additional aid.[471][472][473] Community colleges would earn a $500 financial incentive for each of their G3-participating students receiving a full Pell Grant who completes 30 credits, and an additional $400 financial incentive would be earned by the community college once each of those same students completes an associate degree.[472][473]\nThere are no fixed fields of study that would be included within the G3 program; rather, different fields of study could be included on a changing basis, as determined by economic projections and employer needs.[473] Cybersecurity, coding, clean energy, early childhood education, health care, public safety, and skilled trades are some of the fields of study identified for inclusion.[6][469][472]\nStudents participating in G3 would be required to fulfill two hours[p] of public service, community service, or work experience for each of their academic credit hours.[471][472] This requirement could be fulfilled through taking a position with local or state government, joining a nonprofit organization, or working in one of Virginia's economically depressed regions.[469][471]\nNortham accepts the scientific consensus on climate change and as a candidate for governor vowed to lead efforts to fight climate change. He pledged, if elected, to bring Virginia into the United States Climate Alliance, a multi-state agreement to uphold greenhouse gas emissions standards.[477] Northam has emphasized the negative effects of climate-change-induced sea level rise on Virginia's Tidewater region.[25][477]\nDuring his 2017 campaign for governor, Northam pledged if elected to continue implementing the total maximum daily load limits for nitrogen and phosphorus discharges into Chesapeake Bay, a policy that had reduced harmful algal blooms. Northam said he would continue this policy even if the federal government under Donald Trump cut or eliminated funding for the program. During his campaign, Northam was endorsed by the Virginia League of Conservation Voters and the Virginia Sierra Club.[478]\nNortham has offered conditional support for the proposed Atlantic Coast Pipeline, provided that the pipeline's construction is deemed to be environmentally safe.[479][480] He has avoided taking a firm stance on other pipelines such as the Mountain Valley Pipeline.[481] He opposes both offshore drilling and fracking.[479]\nNortham has supported the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI). In 2019, he vetoed a bill that would have prohibited Virginia from entering into the initiative, but in May 2019, he chose not to veto language in the state budget that prohibits spending related to the initiative, because under Virginia law, governors are generally not allowed to issue line-item vetoes of the state budget. According to The Washington Post, had Northam issued the veto, it could have been challenged in court by the Republican-controlled legislature, and Northam wanted to avoid a long legal confrontation. Northam has said that he will seek to implement RGGI spending in future budgets.[482]\nIn September 2019, Northam signed an executive order establishing a goal for the commonwealth to produce at least 30 percent of its energy from renewable sources in 10 years, a 23 percent improvement on the amount produced at the time he signed the order.[483] In addition to this, Northam set the goal for the state of Virginia to produce 100 percent of its electricity from carbon-free sources by 2050.[484]\nWhen Northam was inaugurated as governor, the family leave policy for executive branch employees in the state of Virginia applied exclusively to employees who had given birth and offered only partial pay. In June 2018, Northam signed an executive order extending the policy to apply to both mothers and fathers, including not only biological parents but also adoptive and foster parents. Under the new policy, employees receive eight weeks off at full pay.[485] Earlier in the year, then-Speaker of the House of Delegates Republican Kirk Cox had established a similar policy offering legislative branch employees twelve weeks of paid leave.[485][486]\nWith regards to private sector employees, Northam has said that he wants to implement tax credits for small businesses that offer paid family leave.[66][487]\nIn 2018, Northam formed a commission to study the possibility of offering child care to state employees in Richmond. Northam's wife, Pam, serves on the panel.[485]\nWhile campaigning for governor, Northam called for new gun control measures in Virginia and often spoke about the issue within the context of his experience treating gunshot victims.[66][488] He then made gun control a priority during his administration. In the 2019 legislative session, Northam introduced gun control measures that failed in the Republican-controlled General Assembly.[489]  After a mass shooting in Virginia Beach that killed 12 people, Northam convened a special legislative session to reconsider gun control legislation, but the General Assembly adjourned after 90 minutes without considering any bills.[489][490][491]\nGun-control measures were then central to the Democratic platform during Virginia's 2019 legislative midterm elections.[492] Democrats won control of both chambers in the state legislature during those elections, and in April 2020, Northam signed a package of five gun control measures into law.[489] The package included universal background checks for gun sales in Virginia; a limit of one-per-month on the purchase of handguns; a requirement for the loss or theft of a firearm to be reported within 48 hours (with a civil penalty of up to $250 for failure to report); an increase in penalties for reckless storage of loaded and unsecured firearms in a way that endangers children under 14 years of age; and an extreme risk protection order (red flag) bill, which provides for a procedure for the temporary removal of guns from people at high risk of self-harm or harm to others.[489][492] Two additional gun-control bills signed that year include amendments proposed by Northam: one of those bills requires evidence that anyone subject to a protective order has surrendered their firearms within twenty-four hours and was amended so that those who fail to comply would be found in contempt of court;[489][493][494] the other bill, which allows for municipal regulations of firearms in public buildings, parks, recreation centers, and during public events, was amended to create an exemption for institutions of higher learning.[489][492][422]\nThe package of gun control legislation supported by Northam in 2020 included an eighth bill that did not pass: it would have banned assault weapons, high-capacity magazines, trigger activators,[q] and silencers.[489][496] The ban on assault weapons would not have applied to firearms already owned in Virginia.[129]\nThe bill limiting handgun purchases to one-a-month reinstates a law that had been repealed in 2012 under then-governor Bob McDonnell; it had originally been passed in 1993 under then-governor Douglas Wilder.[497][498] Virginia was the nineteenth state to pass a red flag law.[489][499]\nNortham supports the Affordable Care Act (\"Obamacare\"), although he has argued that it is in need of improvement.[479][500] After Republican attempts to repeal the law, Northam called for members of Congress to \"put a stop to the uncertainty and work on stabilizing and building on the Affordable Care Act's progress.\"[501]\nNortham opposes a single-payer healthcare system in Virginia, preferring that such a plan be run by the federal government, but supports the creation of a state-run public health insurance option.[66]\nOn February 21, 2019, Northam signed a bipartisan bill raising the smoking age in Virginia from eighteen to twenty-one.[502][r]\nAs governor, Northam has proposed a state budget that would direct $22 million towards closing the racial disparity in Virginia's maternal mortality rate.[130][504] The plan developed by Northam would aim to eliminate the disparity by 2025.[505] It would also aim to reduce infant mortality in Virginia. Northam's proposed funding would allow women who qualify for Medicaid solely because of pregnancy to remain covered for a full year after childbirth - Virginia's current policy allows such coverage to last for sixty days after childbirth - and would allow Medicaid to cover home visitation services for new mothers. Other initiatives that would be covered by the funding include expanding access to contraceptives for poor women in Virginia and expanding access to addiction treatment for mothers in the state.[130][504] Northam has also suggested allowing doulas to be covered by Medicaid in Virginia.[504]\nOn June 7, 2018, Northam signed a bipartisan bill expanding Medicaid in Virginia.[506] This fulfilled one of his central campaign promises.[507][508] Northam's predecessor, Terry McAuliffe, had tried to implement Medicaid expansion throughout his term, but was blocked by Republicans, who controlled the state legislature at the time and opposed the expansion.[509][510] Following the 2017 election, which brought significant gains for Democrats in the Virginia House of Delegates, Republicans still held a narrow legislative majority, but opposition to Medicaid expansion had diminished among Republicans, and several crossed over in support of the bill.[506] Once the bill was enacted on January 1, 2019,[511] Virginia became the 33rd state to expand Medicaid[508][511] and the first to do so since Louisiana in 2016.[512][513] Enrollment in the expanded program began on November 1, 2018.[514] By the beginning of 2019, more than 200,000 Virginians had enrolled in Medicaid as part of the expansion.[515]\nAs part of a compromise with Republican legislators, Northam agreed to a Medicaid expansion plan that would include a work requirement for most able-bodied, childless adults. The work requirement has not taken effect, as it cannot be implemented without a waiver from the federal government.[516][517] Northam's administration initially sought such a waiver, but following Virginia's 2019 midterm elections, in which Democrats took control of the state legislature, Northam paused Virginia's request for the waiver, which at the time was still pending.[517][518]\nIn his 2007 campaign for state Senate, Northam \"advocated for Virginia being 'even more stringent than we are now in fighting illegal immigration,' and said the state should act as 'strong partners' with federal law enforcement.\"[519] Northam's rhetoric shifted in his 2017 gubernatorial campaign.[519] In 2017 Northam pledged to \"stand up against ICE\" so that \"people, especially immigrants, in Virginia aren't living in fear,\" saying: \"Something that we are very proud of in Virginia is that we are inclusive.\" He continued by saying \"We will do everything we can to make sure immigrants are comfortable living here.\"[209] Northam opposed President Trump's decision to rescind Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), which offered temporary stay for unauthorized immigrants who came to the United States as minors.[520] Northam said Trump's \"decision lacks compassion, lacks moral sense, and lacks economic sense.\"[520] Northam supports granting state driver's licenses and in-state tuition to undocumented immigrants.[519]\nIn February 2017, while serving as lieutenant governor, Northam cast a tie-breaking vote in the state Senate against a bill to ban sanctuary cities in Virginia.[59] Northam said he was \"proud to break a tie when Republicans tried to scapegoat immigrants for political gain\" and that he was \"glad to put a stop to\" the bill.[463] In an October 2017 gubernatorial debate, Northam said he did not support sanctuary cities, stating that there currently were none in Virginia, but Northam declined to say whether he would sign a bill as governor that was similar to the one he voted against in the Senate.[521] In November 2017, Northam clarified that while he would veto any bill pre-emptively banning sanctuary cities in Virginia, he would support a ban, if sanctuary cities began appearing in the state.[59] In April 2018, as governor, Northam vetoed a law that would have pre-emptively banned sanctuary cities in Virginia.[522] He vetoed the same legislation again the following year.[523]\nIn November 2019, after President Donald Trump issued an executive order allowing states and localities to abstain from refugee resettlement programs, Northam affirmed Virginia's commitment to accepting refugees, writing to Trump's Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, \"Virginia's lights are on and our doors are open, and we welcome new Virginians to make their homes here...The United States has long presented itself as a haven, a place of stability and economic prosperity. We promote the ideals upon which this country was founded, of liberty and freedom. But to uphold those ideals abroad, we must allow access to them here at home. We must practice what we preach.\"[524]\nNortham has supported LGBT rights throughout his political career.[525][526] While running for lieutenant governor in 2013, he criticized his Republican opponent, E. W. Jackson, for making what were widely considered to be divisive statements about LGBT individuals. During a debate with Jackson, who is a minister, Northam said, \"What I do in church translates to what I do in everyday life. Whether it's said in my church or whether it's said in my medical clinic or whether it's said before the Senate, it's on me and it's what I believe in.\"[527][528] That summer, when the United States Defense Department began offering marriage benefits to military personnel in same-sex relationships, Northam and Jackson disagreed with each other on the issue. Jackson said that because gay marriage was illegal in Virginia at the time, the state should withhold benefits from gay couples serving in its National Guard, while Northam supported the federal policy. Northam said that equalizing benefits for gay couples in the United States military is about \"being fair with those who have served our country.\"[529]\nDuring the 2013 campaign, Northam said that opposition to LGBT rights would create an unwelcoming business environment in Virginia.[530] In 2015, he used his tie-breaking abilities as lieutenant governor to defeat a bill in the state Senate that would have forced Virginia Attorney General Mark Herring to defend the state's gay marriage ban; Herring had argued that the ban was unconstitutional.[531]\nIn 2017, while running for governor, Northam spoke against the Physical Privacy Act, a bill proposed that year in Virginia, which if passed, would have required people in government facilities to use restrooms corresponding to the gender specified on their original birth certificates. Northam called the Physical Privacy Act a \"job-killing, prejudicial bill\".[532] Later that same year, before Northam was elected governor, the Physical Privacy Act was defeated in the state legislature.[533]\nNortham condemned the decision by President Donald Trump to ban transgender service members from the United States military. Shortly after Trump announced this policy, Northam tweeted, \"Anyone who wants to serve our country in the military should be welcomed. They're patriots and should be treated as such.\"[534]\nNortham's first official action as governor was to sign an executive order banning the executive branch of the state government from discriminating against LGBTQ employees.[69][535][536] At the time of Northam's inauguration, the state of Virginia did not have any legislation protecting LGBTQ individuals from employment discrimination.[537][538] Protections on the bases of sexual orientation and gender identity that had been established through an executive order issued by Northam's gubernatorial predecessor, Terry McAuliffe,[s] were maintained by Northam's own executive order, which went further, introducing, for the first time in Virginia, protection on the basis of gender expression.[548][549][546][547][550]\nWhile serving as lieutenant governor, Northam broke a tie in the state Senate, supporting a bill that would have codified into state law the protections included in McAuliffe's aforementioned executive order.[551][539][552] This bill was defeated in the House of Delegates.[553][554] Legislation that would have codified Northam's own executive order into state law passed with bipartisan support in the state Senate during 2018 and 2019, but was denied a vote both years by Republican leadership in the House of Delegates.[555][556][538] If passed, these bills would have applied to all state and local government employees in Virginia, unlike the aforementioned executive orders, which applied only to employees under the governor's personal authority.[542][553]\nAn even more expansive anti-discrimination law, the Virginia Values Act, was passed in Virginia with bipartisan support, after the state's 2019 legislative elections flipped control of both the state Senate and the House of Delegates from Republicans to Democrats.[296][557][558] Northam signed the Virginia Values Act into law on April 11, 2020. The bill, which bans discrimination throughout Virginia on the bases of sexual orientation and gender identity in both public sector and private sector employment, housing, public accommodations, and credit transactions,[559][560][561] is the first legislation in any southern state to extend anti-discrimination protections to LGBTQ individuals.[296][558][562]\nIn 2020, Northam signed legislation expanding gender identity-related rights and protections in Virginia. Northam approved bills barring health insurance companies in the state from discriminating on the basis of gender identity;[563][564][565] establishing a statewide standard for the treatment of transgender students in Virginia schools;[566][t] introducing a non-binary gender option on Virginia driver's licenses and IDs;[296][567] and removing gender reassignment surgery as a prerequisite in Virginia for those seeking to change the sex listed on their birth certificates.[296][565][568]\nIn March 2020, Northam signed a bipartisan bill that made Virginia the twentieth state and first southern state to ban conversion therapy for minors. Upon signing the bill, Northam issued a statement saying, \"This issue is personal for me, as a pediatric neurologist who has cared for thousands of children. Conversion therapy is not only based in discriminatory junk-science, it is dangerous and causes lasting harm to our youth. No one should be made to feel wrong for who they are - especially not a child.\"[569] Days later, Northam signed a bill classifying crimes targeting a victim on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity as hate crimes.[570][571][572] That same year, Northam signed bills repealing the state legal code of Virginia's[u] unenforceable ban on same-sex marriage;[565][573][574] adopting gender-neutral language for spouses throughout state law;[296][564][576][577] and allowing municipalities in Virginia to pass their own laws banning discrimination on the bases of sexual orientation and gender identity.[564][570][571]\nIn May 2020, when Democrats has fresh control of Virginia's state legislature, Northam signed a law decriminalizing marijuana for adult use. Democrats had attempted to pass legislation legalizing it in years past, but had failed every time. It was decriminalized in July 2020, but by then, the state's Democratic party and Northam had explained that it was not enough -- that racial disparities would continue to deepen with just a $25 fine. Following this revelation, he voiced his intent to introduce a bill to legalize it fully. It initially passed with an effective date of July 2024, which Northam and the Virginia ACLU quickly said was not enough. He sent the bill back to the General Assemy, asking for amendments to move the date up to July 2021. The bill was amended and signed by Northam in April 2021, including a provision requested by him making underage possession a civil fine with a substance abuse class. Dispensaries will open on the original date in 2024, while up to four plants can be grown inside your home in 2021.[citation needed]\nIn a political ad run during the 2017 Virginia Democratic primary, Northam said, \"I've been listening carefully to Donald Trump, and I think he's a narcissistic maniac.\"[578] As the general election drew near Northam said, \"[I]f Donald Trump is helping Virginia, I'll work with him.\"[579] Northam explained the \"softer tone\": \"I think people already know [their opinions of Trump] and they are judging for themselves. What we are talking about as we move forward are the policies that are coming out of Washington that are so detrimental to Virginia\".[579]\nDuring his 2017 campaign for governor, Northam said that if elected, he would approve a map of new Virginia legislative and congressional boundaries in the post-2020 redistricting only if it is drawn by a nonpartisan commission.[580]\nIn January 2019, Northam introduced legislation including bills to end Virginia's photo ID law and a bill to allow absentee \"no-excuse\" voting to replace the current law which contains limits. He is also proposing new campaign finance limits that would block direct donations from corporations, cap donations at $10,000, and prohibit the personal use of campaign funds by lawmakers.[581]\nIn October 2019, Northam announced that he had restored the voting rights and other civil rights of more than 22,000 felons who had completed their sentences.[582]\nIn March 2021, he approved the Voting Rights Act of Virginia.[583]\nNortham lives in the Executive Mansion in Richmond. He and his wife Pam have two adult children, Wes and Aubrey.[584] Northam's brother, Thomas Northam, is a lawyer[5] and the law partner of Virginia State Senate member Lynwood Lewis, who was elected to the State Senate to replace Northam when he resigned his State Senate seat to assume the position of lieutenant governor. Their father, Wescott Northam, is a retired Accomack County judge, former Commonwealth's Attorney, and Navy veteran.[585]\nNortham belongs to a predominately black Baptist church in Capeville, Virginia[91][586][587] and serves as the vice chair of the Fort Monroe Authority, which oversees Fort Monroe, a Civil War historic site where Union General Benjamin Butler sheltered freed slaves.[588] In his free time, Northam enjoys working on classic cars.[589] He owns a 1953 Oldsmobile and a 1971 Chevrolet Corvette.[590]\nNortham is a recreational runner and a competitor in races including the Richmond Road Runners' First Day 5k and the Monument Avenue 10K race.[591]\nOn September 25, 2020, Northam and his wife tested positive for COVID-19 after one of their staff members became infected. The governor was asymptomatic; his wife suffered mild symptoms.[592]",

Thousands of them had assembled on the Mall, in Washington, D.C., on the morning of January 6th, to hear Trump address them from a stage outside the White House. From where I stood, at the foot of the Washington Monument, you had to strain to see his image on a jumbotron that had been set up on Constitution Avenue. His voice, however, projected clearly through powerful speakers as he rehashed the debunked allegations of massive fraud which he’d been propagating for months. Then he summarized the supposed crimes, simply, as “bullshit.”\n“Bullshit! Bullshit!” the crowd chanted. It was a peculiar mixture of emotion that had become familiar at pro-Trump rallies since he lost the election: half mutinous rage, half gleeful excitement at being licensed to act on it. The profanity signalled a final jettisoning of whatever residual deference to political norms had survived the past four years. In front of me, a middle-aged man wearing a Trump flag as a cape told a young man standing beside him, “There’s gonna be a war.” His tone was resigned, as if he were at last embracing a truth that he had long resisted. “I’m ready to fight,” he said. The young man nodded. He had a thin mustache and hugged a life-size mannequin with duct tape over its eyes, “traitor” scrawled on its chest, and a noose around its neck.\n“We want to be so nice,” Trump said. “We want to be so respectful of everybody, including bad people. We’re going to have to fight much harder. And Mike Pence is going to have to come through for us.”\nAbout a mile and a half away, at the east end of the Mall, Vice-President Pence and both houses of Congress had convened to certify the Electoral College votes that had made Joe Biden and Kamala Harris the next President and Vice-President of the United States. In December, a hundred and forty Republican representatives—two-thirds of the caucus—had said that they would formally object to the certification of several swing states. Fourteen Republican senators, led by Josh Hawley, of Missouri, and Ted Cruz, of Texas, had joined the effort. The lawmakers lacked the authority to overturn the election, but Trump and his allies had concocted a fantastical alternative: Pence, as the presiding officer of the Senate, could single-handedly nullify votes from states that Biden had won. Pence, though, had advised Congress that the Constitution constrained him from taking such action.\n“After this, we’re going to walk down, and I’ll be there with you,” Trump told the crowd. The people around me exchanged looks of astonishment and delight. “We’re going to walk down to the Capitol, and we’re going to cheer on our brave senators and congressmen and women. We’re probably not going to be cheering so much for some of them—because you’ll never take back our country with weakness. You have to show strength.”\n“No weakness!” a woman cried.\nBefore Trump had even finished his speech, approximately eight thousand people started moving up the Mall. “We’re storming the Capitol!” some yelled.\nThere was an eerie sense of inexorability, the throngs of Trump supporters advancing up the long lawn as if pulled by a current. Everyone seemed to understand what was about to happen. The past nine weeks had been steadily building toward this moment. On November 7th, mere hours after Biden’s win was projected, I attended a protest at the Pennsylvania state capitol, in Harrisburg. Hundreds of Trump supporters, including heavily armed militia members, vowed to revolt. When I asked a man with an assault rifle—a “combat-skills instructor” for a militia called the Pennsylvania Three Percent—how likely he considered the prospect of civil conflict, he told me, “It’s coming.” Since then, Trump and his allies had done everything they could to spread and intensify this bitter aggrievement. On December 5th, Trump acknowledged, “I’ve probably worked harder in the last three weeks than I ever have in my life.” (He was not talking about managing the pandemic, which since the election has claimed a hundred and fifty thousand American lives.) Militant pro-Trump outfits like the Proud Boys—a national organization dedicated to “reinstating a spirit of Western chauvinism” in America—had been openly gearing up for major violence. In early January, on Parler, an unfiltered social-media site favored by conservatives, Joe Biggs, a top Proud Boys leader, had written, “Every law makers who breaks their own stupid Fucking laws should be dragged out of office and hung.”\nOn the Mall, a makeshift wooden gallows, with stairs and a rope, had been constructed near a statue of Ulysses S. Grant. Some of the marchers nearby carried Confederate flags. Up ahead, the dull thud of stun grenades could be heard, accompanied by bright flashes. “They need help!” a man shouted. “It’s us versus the cops!” Someone let out a rebel yell. Scattered groups wavered, debating whether to join the confrontation. “We lost the Senate—we need to make a stand now,” a bookish-looking woman in a down coat and glasses appealed to the person next to her. The previous day, a runoff in Georgia had flipped two Republican Senate seats to the Democrats, giving them majority control.\nHundreds of Trump supporters had forced their way past barricades to the Capitol steps. In anticipation of Biden’s Inauguration, bleachers had been erected there, and the sides of the scaffolding were wrapped in ripstop tarpaulin. Officers in riot gear blocked an open flap in the fabric; the mob pressed against them, screaming insults.\n“You are traitors to the country!” a man barked at the police through a megaphone plastered with stickers from “InfoWars,” the incendiary Web program hosted by the right-wing conspiracist Alex Jones. Behind the man stood Biggs, the Proud Boys leader. He wore a radio clipped onto the breast pocket of his plaid flannel shirt. Not far away, I spotted a “straight pride” flag.\nThere wasn’t nearly enough law enforcement to fend off the mob, which pelted the officers with cans and bottles. One man angrily invoked the pandemic lockdown: “Why can’t I work? Where’s my ‘pursuit of happiness’?” Many people were equipped with flak jackets, helmets, gas masks, and tactical apparel. Guns were prohibited for the protest, but a man in a cowboy hat, posing for a photograph, lifted his jacket to reveal a revolver tucked into his waistband. Other Trump supporters had Tasers, baseball bats, and truncheons. I saw one man holding a coiled noose.\n“Hang Mike Pence!” people yelled.\nSoon the mob swarmed past the officers, into the understructure of the bleachers, and scrambled through its metal braces, up the building’s granite steps. Toward the top was a temporary security wall with three doors, one of which was instantly breached. Dozens of police stood behind the wall, using shields, nightsticks, and pepper spray to stop people from crossing the threshold. Other officers took up positions on planks above, firing a steady barrage of nonlethal munitions into the solid mass of bodies. As rounds tinked off metal, and caustic chemicals filled the space as if it were a fumigation tent, some of the insurrectionists panicked: “We need to retreat and assault another point!” But most remained resolute. “Hold the line!” they exhorted. “Storm!” Martial bagpipes blared through portable speakers.\n“Shoot the politicians!” somebody yelled.\n“Fight for Trump!”\nA jet of pepper spray incapacitated me for about twenty minutes. When I regained my vision, the mob was streaming freely through all three doors. I followed an overweight man in a Roman-era costume—sandals, cape, armguards, dagger—away from the bleachers and onto an open terrace on the Capitol’s main level. People clambered through a shattered window. Video later showed that a Proud Boy had smashed it with a riot shield. A dozen police stood in a hallway softly lit by ornate chandeliers, mutely watching the rioters—many of them wearing Trump gear or carrying Trump flags—flood into the building. Their cries resonated through colonnaded rooms: “Where’s the traitors?” “Bring them out!” “Get these fucking cocksucking Commies out!”\nThe attack on the Capitol was a predictable apotheosis of a months-long ferment. Throughout the pandemic, right-wing protesters had been gathering at statehouses, demanding entry. In April, an armed mob had filled the Michigan state capitol, chanting “Treason!” and “Let us in!” In December, conservatives had broken the glass doors of the Oregon state capitol, overrunning officers and spraying them with chemical agents. The occupation of restricted government sanctums was an affirmation of dominance so emotionally satisfying that it was an end in itself—proof to elected officials, to Biden voters, and also to the occupiers themselves that they were still in charge. After one of the Trump supporters breached the U.S. Capitol, he insisted through a megaphone, “We will not be denied.” There was an unmistakable subtext as the mob, almost entirely white, shouted, “Whose house? Our house!” One man carried a Confederate flag through the building. A Black member of the Capitol Police later told BuzzFeed News that, during the assault, he was called a racial slur fifteen times.\nI followed a group that broke off to advance on five policemen guarding a side corridor. “Stand down,” a man in a maga hat commanded. “You’re outnumbered. There’s a fucking million of us out there, and we are listening to Trump—your boss.”\n“We can take you out,” a man beside him warned.\nThe officers backpedalled the length of the corridor, until we arrived at a marble staircase. Then they moved aside. “We love you guys—take it easy!” a rioter yelled as he bounded up the steps, which led to the Capitol’s central rotunda.\nBeneath the soaring dome, surrounded by statues of former Presidents and by large oil paintings depicting such historical scenes as the embarkation of the Pilgrims and the presentation of the Declaration of Independence, a number of young men chanted, “America first!” The phrase was popularized in 1940 by Nazi sympathizers lobbying to keep the U.S. out of the Second World War; in 2016, Trump resurrected it to describe his isolationist foreign and immigration policies. Some of the chanters, however, waved or wore royal-blue flags inscribed with “AF,” in white letters. This is the logo for the program “America First,” which is hosted by Nicholas Fuentes, a twenty-two-year-old Holocaust denier, who promotes a brand of white Christian nationalism that views politics as a means of preserving demographic supremacy. Though America Firsters revile most mainstream Republicans for lacking sufficient commitment to this priority—especially neoconservatives, whom they accuse of being subservient to Satan and Jews—the group’s loyalty to Trump is, according to Fuentes, “unconditional.”\nThe America Firsters and other invaders fanned out in search of lawmakers, breaking into offices and revelling in their own astounding impunity. “Nancy, I’m ho-ome! ” a man taunted, mimicking Jack Nicholson’s character in “The Shining.” Someone else yelled, “1776—it’s now or never.” Around this time, Trump tweeted, “Mike Pence didn’t have the courage to do what should have been done to protect our Country. . . . USA demands the truth!” Twenty minutes later, Ashli Babbitt, a thirty-five-year-old woman from California, was fatally shot while climbing through a barricaded door that led to the Speaker’s lobby in the House chamber, where representatives were sheltering. The congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a Democrat from New York, later said that she’d had a “close encounter” with rioters during which she thought she “was going to die.” Earlier that morning, another representative, Lauren Boebert—a newly elected Republican, from Colorado, who has praised QAnon and promised to wear her Glock in the Capitol—had tweeted, “Today is 1776.”\nWhen Babbitt was shot, I was on the opposite side of the Capitol, where people were growing frustrated by the empty halls and offices.\n“Where the fuck are they?”\n“Where the fuck is Nancy?”\nNo one seemed quite sure how to proceed. “While we’re here, we might as well set up a government,” somebody suggested.\nThen a man with a large “AF ” flag—college-age, cheeks spotted with acne—pushed through a series of tall double doors, the last of which gave onto the Senate chamber.\n“Praise God!”\nThere were signs of a hasty evacuation: bags and purses on the plush blue-and-red carpet, personal belongings on some of the desks. From the gallery, a man in a flak jacket called down, “Take everything! Take all that shit!”\n“No!” an older man, who wore an ammo vest and held several plastic flex cuffs, shouted. “We do not take anything.” The man has since been identified as Larry Rendall Brock, Jr., a retired Air Force lieutenant colonel.\nThe young America Firster went directly to the dais and installed himself in the leather chair recently occupied by the Vice-President. Another America Firster filmed him extemporizing a speech: “Donald Trump is the emperor of the United States . . .”\n“Hey, get out of that chair,” a man about his age, with a thick Southern drawl, said. He wore cowhide work gloves and a camouflage hunting jacket that was several sizes too large for him. Gauze hung loosely around his neck, and blood, leaking from a nasty wound on his cheek, encrusted his beard. Later, when another rioter asked for his name, he responded, “Mr. Black.” The America Firster turned and looked at him uncertainly.\n“We’re a democracy,” Mr. Black said.\n“Bro, we just broke into the Capitol,” the America Firster scoffed. “What are you talking about?”\nBrock, the Air Force veteran, said, “We can’t be disrespectful.” Using the military acronym for “information operations,” he explained, “You have to understand—it’s an I.O. war.”\nThe America Firster grudgingly left the chair. More than a dozen Trump supporters filed into the chamber. A hundred antique mahogany desks with engraved nameplates were arranged in four tiered semicircles. Several people swung open the hinged desktops and began rifling through documents inside, taking pictures with their phones of private notes and letters, partly completed crossword puzzles, manuals on Senate procedure. A man in a construction hard hat held up a hand-signed document, on official stationery, addressed from “Mitt” to “Mike”—presumably, Romney and Pence. It was the speech that Romney had given, in February, 2020, when he voted to impeach Trump for pressuring the President of Ukraine to produce dirt on Biden. “Corrupting an election to keep oneself in office is perhaps the most abusive and disruptive violation of one’s oath of office that I can imagine,” Romney had written.\nSome senators had printed out their prepared remarks for the election certification that the insurrectionists had disrupted. The man in the hard hat found a piece of paper belonging to Ted Cruz and said, “He was gonna sell us out all along—look! ‘Objection to counting the electoral votes of the state of Arizona.’ ” He paused. “Oh, wait, that’s actually O.K.”\n“He’s with us,” an America Firster said.\nAnother young man, wearing sweatpants and a long-sleeved undershirt, seemed unconvinced. Frantically flipping through a three-ring binder on Cruz’s desk, he muttered, “There’s gotta be something in here we can fucking use against these scumbags.” Someone looking on commented, with serene confidence, “Cruz would want us to do this, so I think we’re good.”\nMr. Black wandered around in a state of childlike wonder. “This don’t look big enough,” he muttered. “This can’t be the right place.” On January 14th, Joshua Black was arrested, in Leeds, Alabama, after he posted a confession on YouTube in which he explained, “I just felt like the spirit of God wanted me to go in the Senate room.” On the day of the riot, as he took in the chamber, he ordered everyone, “Don’t trash the place. No disrespect.” After a while, rather than defy him, nearly everybody left the chamber. For a surreal interlude, only a few people remained. Black’s blood-smeared cheek was grotesquely swollen, and as I looked closer I glimpsed the smooth surface of a yellow plastic projectile embedded deeply within it.\n“I’m gonna call my dad,” he said, and sat down on the floor, leaning his back against the dais.\nA moment later, the door at the back of the chamber’s center aisle swung open, and a man strode through it wearing a fur headdress with horns, carrying a spear attached to an American flag. He was shirtless, his chest covered with Viking and pagan tattoos, his face painted red, white, and blue. It was Jacob Chansley, a vocal QAnon proponent from Arizona, popularly known by his pseudonym, the Q Shaman. Both on the Mall and inside the Capitol, I’d seen countless signs and banners promoting QAnon, whose acolytes believe that Trump is working to dismantle an occult society of cannibalistic pedophiles. At the base of the Washington Monument, I’d watched Chansley assure people, “We got ’em right where we want ’em! We got ’em by the balls, baby, and we’re not lettin’ go!”\n“Fuckin’ A, man,” he said now, looking around with an impish grin. A young policeman had followed closely behind him. Pudgy and bespectacled, with a medical mask over red facial hair, he approached Black, and asked, with concern, “You good, sir? You need medical attention?”\n“I’m good, thank you,” Black responded. Then, returning to his phone call, he said, “I got shot in the face with some kind of plastic bullet.”\n“Any chance I could get you guys to leave the Senate wing?” the officer inquired. It was the tone of someone trying to lure a suicidal person into climbing down from a ledge.\n“We will,” Black assured him. “I been making sure they ain’t disrespectin’ the place.”\n“O.K., I just want to let you guys know—this is, like, the sacredest place.”\nChansley had climbed onto the dais. “I’m gonna take a seat in this chair, because Mike Pence is a fucking traitor,” he announced. He handed his cell phone to another Trump supporter, telling him, “I’m not one to usually take pictures of myself, but in this case I think I’ll make an exception.” The policeman looked on with a pained expression as Chansley flexed his biceps.\nA skinny man in dark clothes told the officer, “This is so weird—like, you should be stopping us.”\nThe officer pointed at each person in the chamber: “One, two, three, four, five.” Then he pointed at himself: “One.” After Chansley had his photographs, the officer said, “Now that you’ve done that, can I get you guys to walk out of this room, please?”\n“Yes, sir,” Chansley said. He stood up and took a step, but then stopped. Leaning his spear against the Vice-President’s desk, he found a pen and wrote something on a sheet of paper.\n“I feel like you’re pushing the line,” the officer said.\nChansley ignored him. After he had set down the pen, I went behind the desk. Over a roll-call list of senators’ names, the Q Shaman had scrawled, “its only a matter of time / justice is coming!”\nThe Capitol siege was so violent and chaotic that it has been hard to discern the specific political agendas of its various participants. Many of them, however, went to D.C. for two previous events, which were more clarifying. On November 14th, tens of thousands of Republicans, convinced that the Democrats had subverted the will of the people in what amounted to a bloodless coup, marched to the Supreme Court, demanding that it overturn the election. For four years, Trump had batted away every inconvenient fact with the phrase “fake news,” and his base believed him when he attributed his decisive defeat in both the Electoral College and the popular vote to “rigged” machines and “massive voter fraud.” While the President’s lawyers inundated battleground states with spurious litigation, one of them, during an interview on Fox Business, acknowledged the basis of their strategy: “We’re waiting for the United States Supreme Court, of which the President has nominated three Justices, to step in and do something.” After nearly every suit had collapsed—with judges appointed by Republicans and Democrats alike harshly criticizing the accusations as “speculative,” “incorrect,” and “not credible,” and Trump’s own Justice Department vouching for the integrity of the election—the attorney general of Texas petitioned the Supreme Court to invalidate all the votes from Wisconsin, Georgia, Pennsylvania, and Michigan (swing states that went for Biden). On December 11th, the night before the second D.C. demonstration, the Justices declined to hear the case, dispelling once and for all the fantasy that Trump, despite losing the election, might legally remain in office.\nThe next afternoon, throngs of Trump supporters crowded into Freedom Plaza, an unadorned public square equidistant from the Justice Department and the White House. On one side, a large audience pressed around a group of preppy-looking young men wearing plaid shirts, windbreakers, khakis, and sunglasses. Some held rosaries and crosses, others royal-blue “AF ” flags. The organizers had not included Fuentes, the “America First” host, in their lineup, but when he arrived at Freedom Plaza the crowd parted for him, chanting, “Groyper!” The name, which America Firsters call one another, derives from a variation of the Pepe the Frog meme, which is fashionable among white supremacists.\nDiminutive and clean-shaven, with boyish features and a toothy smile, Fuentes resembled, in his suit and red tie, a recent graduate dressed for a job interview. (He dropped out of Boston University after his freshman year, when other students became hostile toward him for participating in the deadly neo-Nazi rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2017, and for writing on Facebook that “a tidal wave of white identity is coming.”) Fuentes climbed atop a granite retaining wall, and someone handed him a megaphone. As his speech approached a crescendo of indignation, more and more attendees gravitated to the groypers. “It is us and our ancestors that created everything good that you see in this country,” Fuentes said. “All these people that have taken over our country—we do not need them.”\nThe crowd roared, “Take it back!”—a phrase that would soon ring inside the Capitol.\n“It’s time for us to start saying another word again,” Fuentes shouted. “A very important word that describes the situation we’re in. That word is ‘parasite.’ What is happening in this country is parasitism.” Arguing that Trump alone represented “our interests”—an end to all legal and illegal immigration, gay rights, abortion, free trade, and secularism—Fuentes distilled America Firstism into concise terms: “It is the American people, and our leader, Donald Trump, against everybody else in this country and this world.” The Republican governors, judges, and legislators who had refused to leverage their authority to secure Trump four more years in the White House—“traitors within our own ranks”—were on “a list” of people to be taken down. Fuentes also opposed the Constitution’s checks and balances, which had enabled Biden to prevail. “Make no mistake about it,” he declared. “The system is our enemy.”\nDuring the nine weeks between November 3rd and January 6th, extremists like Fuentes did their utmost to take advantage of the opening that Trump created for them by refusing to concede. They were frank about their intentions: undoing not just the 2020 Presidential outcome but also any form of representative government that allows Democrats to obtain and exercise power. Correctly pointing out that a majority of Republicans believed that the election had been stolen, Fuentes argued, “This is the opportunity to galvanize the patriots of this country behind a real solution to these problems that we’re facing.” He also said, “If we can’t get a country that we deserve to live in through the legitimate process, then maybe we need to begin to explore some other options.” In case anybody was confused about what those options might be, Fuentes explained, “Our Founding Fathers would get in the streets, and they would take this country back by force if necessary. And that is what we must be prepared to do.”\nIn the days before January 6th, calls for a “real solution” became progressively louder. Trump, by both amplifying these voices and consolidating his control over the Republican Party, conferred extraordinary influence on the most deranged and hateful elements of the American right. On December 20th, he retweeted a QAnon supporter who used the handle @cjtruth: “It was a rigged election but they were busted. Sting of the Century! Justice is coming!” A few weeks later, a barbarian with a spear was sitting in the Vice-President’s chair.\nAs Fuentes wrapped up his diatribe, he noticed a drag queen standing on the periphery of the crowd. She wore a blond wig and an evening gown with a beauty-queen sash identifying her as Lady maga. At the November D.C. rally, I had been surprised to see Trump supporters lining up to have their pictures taken with her. Now Fuentes yelled, “That is disgusting! I don’t want to see that!,” and the groypers wheeled on her, bellowing in unison, “Shame!”\nNo one in the crowd objected.\nWhile Fuentes was proposing a movement to “take this country back by force,” a large contingent of Proud Boys marched by. Members from Illinois, Pennsylvania, Oregon, California, and elsewhere were easy to identify. Most were dressed in the organization’s black-and-yellow colors. Some had “rwds”—Right-Wing Death Squad—hats and patches; others wore balaclavas, kilts, hockey masks, or batting helmets. One man was wearing a T-shirt with an image of South American dissidents being thrown out of a helicopter and the words “pinochet did nothing wrong!” Another T-shirt featured a Nazi eagle perched on a fasces, below the acronym “6mwe”—Six Million Wasn’t Enough—a reference to the number of Jews slaughtered in the Holocaust.\nMany of the Proud Boys were drunk. At around nine-thirty that morning, I’d stopped by Harry’s Pub, a dive bar close to Freedom Plaza, and found the street outside filled with men drinking Budweiser and White Claw. “We are going to own this town!” one of them howled. At the November 14th rally, clashes between the Proud Boys and antifascists had left a number of people injured. Although most of the fights I witnessed then had been instigated by the Proud Boys, Trump had tweeted, “ANTIFA SCUM ran for the hills today when they tried attacking the people at the Trump Rally, because those people aggressively fought back.” It was clear that the men outside Harry’s on December 12th had travelled to D.C. to engage in violence, and that they believed the President endorsed their doing so. Trump had made an appearance at the previous rally, waving through the window of his limousine; now I overheard a Proud Boy tell his comrade, “I wanna see Trump drive by and give us one of these.” He flashed an “O.K.” hand sign, which has become a gesture of allegiance among white supremacists. There would be no motorcade this time, but while Fuentes addressed the groypers Trump circled Freedom Plaza in Marine One, the Presidential helicopter.\nThe Proud Boys who marched past Fuentes at the end of his December 12th speech were heading to the Washington Monument. When I got there, hundreds of them covered the grassy expanse near the obelisk. “Let’s take Black Lives Matter Plaza!” someone suggested. In June, the security fence around the White House had been expanded, subsuming green spaces previously open to the public, in response to protests over the killing of George Floyd, in Minneapolis. Muriel Bowser, the mayor of D.C., had renamed two blocks adjacent to the fence Black Lives Matter Plaza, and commissioned the city to paint “black lives matter” across the pavement in thirty-five-foot-high letters. Throughout the latter half of 2020, Trump had sought to dismiss the popular uprisings that Floyd’s death had precipitated by ascribing them to Antifa, which he vilified as a terrorist organization. The Proud Boys had seized on Trump’s conflation to recast their small-scale rivalry with antifascists in leftist strongholds like Berkeley and Portland as the front line of a national culture war. During the Presidential campaign, Trump’s histrionic exaggerations of the threat posed by Antifa fuelled conservative support for the Proud Boys, allowing them to vastly expand their operations and recruitment. The day after a Presidential debate in which Trump told the Proud Boys to “stand back and stand by,” Lauren Witzke, a Republican Senate candidate in Delaware, publicly thanked the group for having provided her with “free security.” (She lost the race.)\nAs Proud Boys from across the nation walked downhill from the Washington Monument toward Black Lives Matter Plaza on December 12th, they chanted, “Whose plaza? Our plaza!” Many of them carried staffs, canes, and holstered Maglites. There was a heavy police presence downtown, and it was still broad daylight. “We got numbers, let’s do this!” a Proud Boy with a newsboy cap and a gray goatee shouted. “Fuck these gender-confused terrorists! They’ll put the girls out first—they think that’s gonna stop us?” His name was Richard Schwetz, though he went by Dick Sweats. (He could not be reached for comment.) While some Proud Boys hesitated, others followed Schwetz, including a taciturn man with a high-and-tight military haircut and a large Confederate flag attached to a wooden dowel. I saw him again at the Capitol on January 6th.\nOn Constitution Avenue, the Proud Boys encountered an unsuspecting Black man coming up the sidewalk. They began shoving and jeering at him. As the man ran away, several of them chased him, swinging punches at his back.\nOfficers had cordoned off Black Lives Matter Plaza, but the group soon reached Farragut Square, where half a dozen counter-protesters—two men and four women—stood outside the Army and Navy Club, dressed in black clothes marked with medic crosses made from red tape. They were smaller and younger than most of the Proud Boys, and visibly unnerved. As Schwetz and others closed in on them, the medics retreated until they were pressed against a waist-high hedge. “Fucking pussies!” Schwetz barked, hitting two of the women. Other Proud Boys took his cue, assailing the activists, who disappeared into the hedge under a barrage of boots and fists. Policemen stopped the beating by deploying pepper spray, but they did not arrest any Proud Boys, who staggered off in search of a new target.\nThey promptly found one: another Black man, passing through on his bicycle. He wore Lycra exercise gear and looked perplexed by what was happening on the streets. He said nothing to anybody, but “Black Lives Matter” was written in small letters on his helmet. The Proud Boys surrounded him. Pointing at some officers watching from a few feet away, a man in a bulletproof vest, carrying a cane, said, “They’re here now, but eventually they won’t be. And we’re gonna take this country back—believe that shit. Fuck Black Lives Matter.” Before walking off, he added, “What y’all need to do is take your sorry asses to the ghetto.”\nThis was the tenor of the next eight hours, as hundreds of Proud Boys, groypers, militia members, and other Trump supporters openly marauded on the streets around the White House, becoming more inebriated and belligerent as the night wore on, hunting for people to harass and assault. “Fight for Trump!” they chanted. At one point, Proud Boys outside Harry’s Pub ganged up on another Black man, Philip Johnson, who took out a knife in self-defense, wounding four of them. Police intervened and rushed Johnson to the hospital, where he was arrested. The charges were later dropped. Outside Harry’s, I heard a Proud Boy joking about Johnson’s injuries: “He’s going to look different tomorrow.”\nShortly thereafter, I followed a number of groypers past a hair salon with a rainbow poster attached to its window. Tearing the poster to pieces, a young man screamed, “This is sodomy!”\n“Fuck the fags!” others cried.\nBy eleven, I was following another group, which happened upon the Metropolitan African Methodist Episcopal Church. Built in the late nineteenth century, the steepled red brick building had hosted the funerals of Frederick Douglass and Rosa Parks. President Barack Obama had attended a service there on the morning of his second Inauguration. Outside the entrance, a large Black Lives Matter sign, illuminated by floodlamps, hung below a crucifix. Climbing over a low fence, several Proud Boys and men in red maga hats ripped down the sign and pried off boards from its scaffolding to use as weapons, eliciting wild cheers.\n“Whose streets?”\n“Our streets!”\nDecember 12th, just after 11 P.M., outside the Metropolitan African Methodist Episcopal Church.\nMore people piled into the garden of the church, stomping on the sign and slashing it with knives. Amid the frenzy, one of the Trump supporters removed another placard from a different display. It had a verse from the Bible: “I shall not sacrifice to the Lord my God that which costs me nothing.”\n“Hey, that’s Christian,” someone admonished.\nThe man nodded and gingerly set the placard down.\nThe cascade of destruction and ugliness triggered by Trump’s lies about the election consummates a narrative that predates his tenure in the White House. In 2011, Trump became an evangelist for birtherism, the false assertion that Obama had been born in Kenya and was therefore an illegitimate President. Whether or not Trump believed the racist slander, he had been apprised of its political utility by his friend Roger Stone, who made his political reputation as a dirty trickster for President Richard Nixon. Five years later, in the months before the 2016 election, Stone created a Web site called Stop the Steal, which he used to undermine Hillary Clinton’s expected victory by insisting that the election had been rigged—a position that Trump maintained even after he won, to explain his deficit in the popular vote.\nThe day after the 2020 election, a new Facebook page appeared: Stop the Steal. Among its earliest posts was a video from the T.C.F. Center, in downtown Detroit, where Michigan ballots were counted. The video showed Republican protesters who were said to have been denied access to the room where absentee votes were being processed. Overnight, Stop the Steal gained more than three hundred and twenty thousand followers—making it among the fastest-growing groups in Facebook history. The company quickly deleted it.\nI spent much of Election Day at the T.C.F. Center. covid-19 had killed three thousand residents of Wayne County, which includes Detroit, causing an unprecedented number of people to vote by mail. Nearly two hundred thousand absentee ballots were being tallied in a huge exhibit hall. Roughly eight hundred election workers were opening envelopes, removing ballots from sealed secrecy sleeves, and logging names into an electronic poll book. (Before Election Day, the clerk’s office had compared and verified signatures.) The ballots were then brought to a row of high-speed tabulators, which could process some fifty sheets a minute.\nRepublican and Democratic challengers roamed the hall. The press was confined to a taped-off area, but, as far as I could see, the Republicans were given free rein of the space. They checked computer monitors that displayed a growing list of names. A man’s voice came over a loudspeaker to remind the election workers to “provide for transparency and openness.” Christopher Thomas, who served as Michigan’s election director for thirty-six years and advised the clerk’s office in 2020, told me that things had gone remarkably smoothly. The few challengers who’d raised objections had mostly misunderstood technical aspects of the process. “We work through it with them,” Thomas said. “We’re happy to have them here.”\nEarly returns showed Trump ahead in Michigan, but many absentee ballots had yet to be processed. Because Trump had relentlessly denigrated absentee voting throughout the campaign, in-person votes had been expected to skew his way. It was similarly unsurprising when his lead diminished after results arrived from Wayne County and other heavily Democratic jurisdictions. Nonetheless, shortly after midnight, Trump launched his post-election misinformation campaign: “We are up BIG, but they are trying to STEAL the Election.”\nThe next day, I found an angry mob outside the T.C.F. Center. Police officers guarded the doors. Most of the protesters had driven down from Macomb County, which is eighty per cent white and went for Trump in both 2016 and 2020. “We know what’s going on here,” one man told me. “They’re stuffing the ballot box.” He said that his local Republican Party had sent out an e-mail urging people to descend on the center. Politico later reported that Laura Cox, the chairwoman of the Michigan G.O.P., had personally implored conservative activists to go there. I had seen Cox introduce Trump at a rally in Grand Rapids the night before the election; she had promised the crowd “four more years—or twelve, we’ll talk about that later.”\nDozens of protesters had entered the T.C.F. Center before it was sealed. Downstairs, they pressed against a glass wall of the exhibit hall, chanting at the election workers on the other side. The most strident member of the group was Ken Licari, a Macomb County resident with a thin beard and a receding hairline. The two parties had been allocated one challenger for each table in the hall, but Republicans had already exceeded that limit, and Licari was irate about being shut out. When an elderly A.C.L.U. observer was ushered past him, Licari demanded to know where she was from. The woman ignored him, and he shouted, “You’re a coward, is where you’re from!”\n“Be civil,” a woman standing near him said. A forty-eight-year-old caretaker named Lisa, she had stopped by the convention center on a whim, “just to see.” Unlike almost everyone else there, Lisa was Black and from Detroit. She gently asked Licari, “If this place has cameras, and you’ve got media observing, you’ve got different people from both sides looking—why do you think someone would be intentionally trying to cheat with all those eyes?”\n“You would have to have a hundred thirty-four cameras to track every ballot,” Licari answered.\n“These ballots are from Detroit,” Lisa said. “Detroit is an eighty-per-cent African-American city. There’s a huge percentage of Democrats. That’s just a fact.” She gestured at the predominantly Black poll workers across the glass. “This is my whole thing—I have a basic level of respect for these people.”\nRather than respond to this tacit accusation of bias, Licari told Lisa that a batch of illegal ballots had been clandestinely delivered to the center at three in the morning. This was a reference to another cell-phone video, widely shared on social media, that showed a man removing a case from the back of a van, loading it in a wagon, and pulling the wagon into the building. I had watched the video and had recognized the man as a member of a local TV news crew I’d noticed the previous day. I distinctly recall admiring the wagon, which he had used to transport his camera gear.\n“There’s a lot of suspicious activity that goes on down here in Detroit,” another Republican from Macomb County told me. “There’s a million ways you can commit voter fraud, and we’re afraid it was committed on a massive scale.” I had seen the man on Election Day, working as a challenger inside the exhibit hall. Now, as then, he wore old Army dog tags and a hooded Michigan National Guard sweatshirt with the sleeves cut off. I asked him if he had observed any fraud with his own eyes. He had not. “It wasn’t committed by these people,” he said. “But the ballots that they were given and ran through the scanners—we don’t know where they came from.”\nLike many of the Republicans in the T.C.F. Center, the man had been involved in anti-lockdown demonstrations against Michigan’s governor, Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat. While reporting on those protests, I’d been struck by how the mostly white participants saw themselves as upholding the tradition of the civil-rights movement. Whitmer’s public-health measures were condemned as oppressive infringements on sacrosanct liberties, and those who defied them compared themselves to Rosa Parks. The equivalency became even more bizarre after George Floyd was killed and anti-lockdown activists in Michigan adopted Trump’s law-and-order rhetoric. Yet I never had the impression that those Republican activists were disingenuous. Similarly, the white people shouting at the Black election workers in Detroit seemed truly convinced of their own persecution.\nThat conviction had been instilled at least in part by politicians who benefitted from it. In April, in response to Whitmer’s aggressive public-health measures, Trump had tweeted, “Liberate Michigan!” Two weeks later, heavily armed militia members entered the state capitol, terrifying lawmakers. Mike Shirkey, the Republican majority leader in the Michigan Senate, denounced the organizers of the action—a group called the American Patriot Council—as “a bunch of jackasses” who had brandished “the threat of physical harm to stir up fear and rancor.” But, as Trump and other Republicans stoked anti-lockdown resentment across the U.S., Shirkey reversed himself. In May, he appeared at an American Patriot Council event in Grand Rapids, where he told the assembled militia members, “We need you now more than ever.” A few months later, two brothers in the audience that day, William and Michael Null, were arrested for providing material support to a network of right-wing terrorists.\nOutside the T.C.F. Center, I ran into Michelle Gregoire, a twenty-nine-year-old school-bus driver from Battle Creek. The sleeves of her sweatshirt were pushed up to reveal a “We the People” tattoo, and she wore a handgun on her belt. We had met at several anti-lockdown protests, including the one in Grand Rapids where Shirkey spoke. In April, Gregoire had entered the gallery overlooking the House chamber in the Michigan state capitol, in violation of COVID-19 protocols. She had to be dragged out by the chief sergeant at arms, and she is now charged with committing a felony assault against him. (She has pleaded not guilty.)\nGregoire is also an acquaintance of the Nulls. “They’re innocent,” she told me in Detroit. “There’s an attack on conservatives right now.” She echoed many Republicans I have met in the past nine months who have described to me the same animating emotion: fear. “A lot of conservatives are really scared,” she said. “Extreme government overreach” during the pandemic had proved that the Democrats aimed, above all, to subjugate citizens. In October, Facebook deleted Gregoire’s account, which contained posts about a militia that she belonged to at the time. She told me, “If the left gets their way, they will silence whoever they want.” She then expressed another prevalent apprehension on the right: that Democrats intend to disarm Americans, in order to render them defenseless against autocracy. “That terrifies me,” Gregoire said. “In other countries, they’ve said, ‘That will never happen here,’ and before you know it their guns are confiscated and they’re living under communism.”\nThe sense of embattlement that Trump and other Republican politicians encouraged throughout the pandemic primed many conservatives to assume Democratic foul play even before voting began. Last month, at a State Senate hearing on the count at the T.C.F. Center, a witness, offering no evidence of fraud, demanded to see evidence that none had occurred. “We believe,” he testified. “Prove us wrong.” The witness was Randy Bishop, a conservative Christian-radio host and a former county G.O.P. chairman, as well as a felon with multiple convictions for fraud. I’d watched Bishop deliver a rousing speech in June at an American Patriot Council rally, which Gregoire and the Null brothers had attended. “Carrying a gun with you at all times and being a member of a militia is also your civic duty,” Bishop had argued. According to the F.B.I., the would-be terrorists whom the Nulls abetted used the rally to meet and further their plans, which included televised executions of Democratic lawmakers. When I was under the bleachers at the U.S. Capitol, while the mob pushed up the steps, I noticed Jason Howland, a founder of the American Patriot Council, a few feet behind me in the scrum, leaning all his weight into the mass of bodies.\nEven if it were possible to prove that the election was not stolen, it seems doubtful whether conservatives who already feel under attack could be convinced. When Gregoire cited the man with the van smuggling a case of ballots into the T.C.F. Center, I told her that he was a journalist and that the case contained equipment. Gregoire shook her head. “No,” she said. “Those were ballots. It’s not a conspiracy when it’s documented and recorded.”\nConspiracy theories have always helped rationalize white grievance, and people who exploit white grievance for political or financial gain often purvey conspiracy theories. Roger Stone became Trump’s adviser for the 2016 Republican primaries, and frequently appeared on Alex Jones’s “InfoWars” show, which warned that the “deep state”—a nefarious shadow authority manipulating U.S. policy for the profit of élites—opposed Trump because he threatened its power. Jones has asserted that the Bush Administration was responsible for 9/11 and that the Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre never happened. During the 2016 campaign, Stone arranged for Trump to be a guest on “InfoWars.” “I will not let you down,” Trump promised Jones.\nThis compact with the conspiracist right strengthened over the next four years, as the President characterized his impeachment and the special counsel Robert Mueller’s report on Russian election meddling as “hoaxes” designed to “overthrow” him. (Stone was convicted of seven felonies related to the Mueller investigation, including making false statements and witness tampering. Trump pardoned him in December. Ten days later, Stone reactivated his Stop the Steal Web site, which began collecting donations for “security” in D.C. on January 6th.) This past year, the scale of the pandemic helped conspiracists broaden the scope of their theories. Many covid-19 skeptics believe that lockdowns, mask mandates, vaccines, and contact tracing are laying the groundwork for the New World Order—a genocidal communist dystopia that, Jones says, will look “just like ‘The Hunger Games.’ ” The architects of this apocalypse are such “globalists” as the Clintons, Bill Gates, and George Soros; their instruments are multinational institutions like the European Union, nato, and the U.N. Whereas Trump has enfeebled these organizations, Biden intends to reinvigorate them. The claim of a plot to steal the election makes sense to people who see Trump as a warrior against deep-state chicanery. Like all good conspiracy theories, it affirms and elaborates preëxisting ones. Rejecting it can require renouncing an entire world view.\nTrump’s allegations of vast election fraud have been a boon for professional conspiracists. Not long ago, Jones seemed to be at risk of sliding into obsolescence. Facebook, Twitter, Apple, Spotify, and YouTube had expelled him from their platforms in 2018, after he accused the bereaved parents of children murdered at Sandy Hook of being paid actors, prompting “InfoWars” fans to harass and threaten them. The bans curtailed Jones’s reach, but a deluge of covid-19 propaganda drew millions of people to his proprietary Web sites. To some Americans, Jones’s dire warnings about the deep state and the New World Order looked prophetic, an impression that Trump’s claim of a stolen election only bolstered.\nAfter Facebook removed the Stop the Steal group that had posted the video from the T.C.F. Center, its creator, Kylie Jane Kremer, a thirty-year-old activist, conceived the November 14th rally in Washington, D.C., which became known as the Million maga March. That day, Jones joined tens of thousands of Trump supporters gathered at Freedom Plaza. Kremer, stepping behind a lectern with a microphone, promised “an incredible lineup” of speakers, after which, she said, everyone would proceed up Pennsylvania Avenue, to the Supreme Court. But, before Kremer could introduce her first guest, Jones had shouted through a bullhorn, “If the globalists think they’re gonna keep America under martial law, and they’re gonna put that Communist Chinese agent Biden in, they got another thing coming!”\nHundreds of people cheered. Jones, who is all chest and no neck, pumped a fist in the air. “The march starts now!” he soon declared. His usual security detail was supplemented by about a dozen Proud Boys, who formed a protective ring around him. The national chairman of the Proud Boys, Henry (Enrique) Tarrio, walked at his side. Tarrio, the chief of staff of Latinos for Trump, is the son of Cuban immigrants who fled Fidel Castro’s revolution. Although he served time in federal prison for rebranding and relabelling stolen medical devices, he often cites his family history to portray himself and the Proud Boys in a noble light. At an event in Miami in 2019, he stood behind Trump, wearing a T-shirt that said “roger stone did nothing wrong!”\n“Down with the deep state!” Jones yelled through his bullhorn. “The answer to their ‘1984’ tyranny is 1776!” As he and Tarrio continued along Pennsylvania Avenue, more and more people abandoned Kremer’s event to follow them. As we climbed toward the U.S. Capitol, I turned and peered down at a procession of Trump supporters stretching back for more than a mile. Flags waved like the sails of a bottlenecked armada. From this vantage, the Million maga March appeared to have been led by the Proud Boys and Jones. On the steps of the Supreme Court, he cried, “This is the beginning of the end of their New World Order!”\nInvocations of the New World Order often raise the age-old spectre of Jewish cabals, and the Stop the Steal movement has been rife with anti-Semitism. At the protest that I attended on November 7th in Pennsylvania, a speaker elicited applause with the exhortation “Do not become a cog in the zog!” The acronym stands for “Zionist-occupied government.” Among the Trump supporters was an elderly woman who gripped a walker with her left hand and a homemade “Stop the Steal” sign with her right. The first letters of “Stop” and “Steal” were stylized to resemble Nazi S.S. bolts. In videos of the shooting inside the Capitol on January 6th, amid the mob attempting to reach members of Congress, a man—subsequently identified as Robert Keith Packer—can be seen in a sweatshirt emblazoned with the words “Camp Auschwitz.” (Packer has been arrested.)\nOn my way back down Pennsylvania Avenue on November 14th, after Jones’s speech, I fell in with a group of groypers chanting “Christian nation!” and “Emperor Trump!” I followed the young men to Freedom Plaza, where one of them read aloud an impassioned screed about “globalist scum” and the need to “strike down this foreign invasion.” When he finished, I noticed that two groypers standing near me were laughing. The response felt incongruous, until I recognized it as the juvenile thrill of transgression. One of them, his voice high with excitement, marvelled, “He just gave a fascist speech!”\nA few days later, Nicholas Fuentes appeared on an “InfoWars” panel with Alex Jones and other right-wing conspiracists. During the discussion, Fuentes warned of the “Great Replacement.” This is the contention that Europe and the United States are under siege from nonwhites and non-Christians, and that these groups are incompatible with Western culture, identity, and prosperity. Many white supremacists maintain that the ultimate outcome of the Great Replacement will be “white genocide.” (In Charlottesville, neo-Nazis chanted, “Jews will not replace us!”; the perpetrators of the New Zealand mosque massacre and the El Paso Walmart massacre both cited the Great Replacement in their manifestos.) “What people have to begin to realize is that if we lose this battle, and if this transition is allowed to take place, that’s it,” Fuentes said. “That’s the end.”\n“Submitting now will destroy you forever,” Jones agreed.\nBecause Fuentes and Jones characterize Democrats as an existential menace—Jones because they want to incrementally enslave humanity, Fuentes because they want to make whites a demographic minority—their fight transcends partisan politics. The same is true for the many evangelicals who have exalted Trump as a Messianic figure divinely empowered to deliver the country from satanic influences. Right-wing Catholics, for their part, have mobilized around the “church militant” movement—fostered by Stephen Bannon, Trump’s former chief strategist—which puts Trump at the forefront of a worldwide clash between Western civilization and Islamic “barbarity.” Crusader flags and patches were widespread at the Capitol insurrection.\nIn the Senate chamber on January 6th, Jacob Chansley took off his horns and led a group prayer through a megaphone, from behind the Vice-President’s desk. The insurrectionists bowed their heads while Chansley thanked the “heavenly Father” for allowing them to enter the Capitol and “send a message” to the “tyrants, the communists, and the globalists.” Joshua Black, the Alabaman who had been shot in the face with a rubber bullet, said in his YouTube confession, “I praised the name of Jesus on the Senate floor. That was my goal. I think that was God’s goal.”\nWhile the religiously charged demonization of globalists dovetails with QAnon, religious maximalism has also gone mainstream. Under Trump, Republicans throughout the country have consistently situated American politics in the context of an eternal, cosmic struggle between good and evil. In doing so, they have rendered constitutional principles of representation, pluralism, and the separation of powers less inviolable, given the magnitude of what is at stake.\nTrump played to this sensibility on June 1st, a week after George Floyd was killed. Police officers used rubber bullets, batons, tear gas, and pepper-ball grenades to violently disperse peaceful protesters in Lafayette Square so that he could walk unmolested from the White House to a church and pose for a photograph while holding a Bible. Liberals were appalled. For many of the President’s supporters, however, the image was symbolically resonant. Lafayette Square was subsequently enclosed behind a tall metal fence, which racial-justice protesters decorated with posters, converting it into a makeshift memorial to victims of police violence. On the morning of the November 14th rally, thousands of Trump supporters passed the fence on their way to Freedom Plaza. Some of them stopped to rip down posters, and by nine o’clock cardboard littered the sidewalk.\n“White folks feel real emboldened these days,” Toni Sanders, a local activist, told me. Sanders had been at the square on June 1st, with her wife and her nine-year-old stepson. “He was tear-gassed,” she said. “He’s traumatized.” She had returned there the day of the march to prevent people from defacing the fence, and had already been in several confrontations. While we spoke, people carrying religious signs approached. They were affiliates of Patriot Prayer, a conservative Christian movement, based in Vancouver, Washington, whose rallies have often attracted white supremacists. Kyle Chapman, a prominent Patriot Prayer figure from California (and a felon), once headed the Fraternal Order of Alt-Knights, a “tactical defense arm” of the Proud Boys. A few days before the march, Chapman had posted a statement on social media proposing that the Proud Boys change their name to the Proud Goys, purge all “undesirables,” and “boldly address the issues of White Genocide” and “the right for White men and women to have their own countries where White interests are written into law.”\nThe founder of Patriot Prayer, Joey Gibson, has praised Chapman as “a true patriot” and “an icon.” (He also publicly disavows racism and anti-Semitism.) In December, Gibson led the group that broke into the Oregon state capitol. “Look at them,” Sanders said as Gibson passed us, yelling about Biden being a communist. “Full of hate, and proud of it.” She shook her head. “If God were here, He would smite these motherfuckers.”\nSince January 6th, some Republican politicians have distanced themselves from Trump. A few, such as Romney, have denounced him. But the Republican Party’s cynical embrace of Trump’s attempted power grab all the way up to January 6th has strengthened its radical flank while sidelining moderates. Seventeen Republican-led states and a hundred and six Republican members of Congress—well over half—signed on to the Texas suit asking the Supreme Court to disenfranchise more than twenty million voters. Republican officials shared microphones with white nationalists and conspiracists at every Stop the Steal event I attended. At the Million maga March, Louie Gohmert, a congressman from Texas, spoke shortly after Alex Jones on the steps of the Supreme Court. “This is a multidimensional war that the U.S. intelligence people have used on other governments,” Gohmert said—words that might have come from Jones’s mouth. “You not only steal the vote but you use the media to convince people that they’re not really seeing what they’re seeing.”\n“We see!” a woman in the crowd cried.\nIn late December, Gohmert and other Republican legislators filed a lawsuit asking the courts to affirm Vice-President Pence’s right to unilaterally determine the results of the election. When federal judges dismissed the case, Gohmert declared on TV that the ruling had left patriots with only one form of recourse: “You gotta go to the streets and be as violent as Antifa and B.L.M.”\nGohmert is a mainstay of the Tea Party insurgency that facilitated Trump’s political rise. Both that movement and Trumpism are preoccupied as much with heretical conservatives as they are with liberals. At an October rally, Trump derided rinos—Republicans in name only—as “the lowest form of human life.” After the election, any Republican who accepted Biden’s victory was similarly maligned. When Chris Krebs, a Trump appointee in charge of national cybersecurity, deemed the election “the most secure in American history,” the President fired him. Joe diGenova, Trump’s attorney, then said that Krebs “should be drawn and quartered—taken out at dawn and shot.”\nAs Republican officials scrambled to prove their fealty to the President, some joined Gohmert in invoking the possibility of violent rebellion. In December, the Arizona Republican Party reposted a tweet from Ali Alexander, a chief organizer of the Stop the Steal movement, that stated, “I am willing to give my life for this fight.” The Twitter account of the Republican National Committee appended the following comment to the retweet: “He is. Are you?”\nAlexander is a convicted felon, having pleaded guilty to property theft in 2007 and credit-card abuse in 2008. In November, he appeared on the “InfoWars” panel with Jones and Fuentes, during which he alluded to the belief that the New World Order would forcibly implant people with digital-tracking microchips. “I’m just not going to go into that world,” Alexander said. He also expressed jubilant surprise at how successful he, Jones, and Fuentes had been in recruiting mainstream Republicans to their cause: “We are the crazy ones, rushing the gates. But we are winning!”\nJones, Fuentes, and Alexander were not seen rushing the gates when lives were lost at the Capitol on January 6th. Nor, for that matter, was Gohmert. Ashli Babbitt, the woman who was fatally shot, was an Air Force veteran who appears to have been indoctrinated in conspiracy theories about the election. She was killed by an officer protecting members of Congress—perhaps Gohmert among them. In her final tweet, on January 5th, Babbitt declared, “The storm is here”—a reference to a QAnon prophecy that Trump would expose and execute all his enemies. The same day that Babbitt wrote this, Alexander led crowds at Freedom Plaza in chants of “Victory or death!” During the sacking of the Capitol, he recorded a video from a rooftop, with the building in the distance behind him. “I do not denounce this,” he said.\nTrump was lying when, after dispatching his followers to the Capitol, he assured them, “I’ll be with you.” But, in a sense, he was there—as were Jones, Fuentes, and Alexander. Their messaging was ubiquitous: on signs, clothes, patches, and flags, and in the way that the insurrectionists articulated what they were doing. At one point, I watched a man with a long beard and a Pittsburgh Pirates hat facing off against several policemen on the main floor of the Capitol. “I will not let this country be taken over by globalist communist scum!” he yelled, hoarse and shaking. “They want us all to be slaves! Everybody’s seen the documentation—it’s out in the open!” He could not comprehend why the officers would want to interfere in such a virtuous uprising. “You know what’s right,” he told them. Then he gestured vaguely at the rest of the rampaging mob. “Just like these people know what’s right.”\nAfter Chansley, the Q Shaman, left his note on the dais, a new group entered the Senate chamber. Milling around was a man in a black-and-yellow plaid shirt, with a bandanna over his face. Ahead of January 6th, Tarrio, the Proud Boys chairman, had released a statement announcing that his men would “turn out in record numbers” for the event—but would be “incognito.” The man in the plaid shirt was the first Proud Boy I had seen openly wearing the organization’s signature colors. At several points, however, I heard grunts of “Uhuru!,” a Proud Boys battle cry, and a group attacking a police line outside the Capitol had sung “Proud of Your Boy”—from the Broadway version of “Aladdin”—for which the organization is sardonically named. One member of the group had flashed the “O.K.” sign and shouted, “Fuck George Floyd! Fuck Breonna Taylor! Fuck them all!” He seemed overcome with emotion, as if at last giving expression to a sentiment that he had long suppressed.\nOn January 4th, Tarrio had been arrested soon after his arrival at Dulles International Airport, for a destruction-of-property charge related to the December 12th event, where he’d set fire to a Black Lives Matter banner stolen from a historic Black church. (In an intersection outside Harry’s Pub, he had stood over the flames while Proud Boys chanted, “Fuck you, faggots!”) He was released shortly after his arrest but was barred from remaining in D.C. On the eve of the siege, followers of the official Proud Boys account on Parler were incensed. “Every cop involved should be executed immediately,” one user commented. “Time to resist and revolt!” another added. A third wrote, “Fuck these DC Police. Fuck those cock suckers up. Beat them down. You dont get to return to your families.”\nSince George Floyd’s death, demands from leftists to curb police violence have inspired a Back the Blue movement among Republicans, and most right-wing outfits present themselves as ardently pro-law enforcement. This alliance is conditional, however, and tends to collapse whenever laws intrude on conservative values and priorities. In Michigan, I saw anti-lockdown protesters ridicule officers enforcing covid-19 restrictions as “Gestapo” and “filthy rats.” When police cordoned off Black Lives Matter Plaza, Proud Boys called them “communists,” “cunts,” and “pieces of shit.” At the Capitol on January 6th, the interactions between Trump supporters and law enforcement vacillated from homicidal belligerence to borderline camaraderie—a schizophrenic dynamic that compounded the dark unreality of the situation. When a phalanx of officers at last marched into the Senate chamber, no arrests were made, and everyone was permitted to leave without questioning. As we passed through the central doors, a sergeant with a shaved head said, “Appreciate you being peaceful.” His uniform was half untucked and missing buttons, and his necktie was ripped and crooked. Beside him, another officer, who had been sprayed with a fire extinguisher, looked as if a sack of flour had been emptied on him.\nA policeman loitering in the lobby escorted us down a nearby set of stairs, where we overtook an elderly woman carrying a “trump” tote bag. “We scared them off—that’s what we did, we scared the bastards,” she said, to no one in particular.\nThe man in front of me had a salt-and-pepper beard and a baseball cap with a “We the People” patch on the back. I had watched him collect papers from various desks in the Senate chamber and put them in a glossy blue folder. As police directed us to an exit, he walked out with the folder in his hand.\nThe afternoon was cold and blustery. Thousands of people still surrounded the building. On the north end of the Capitol, a renewed offensive was being mounted, on another entrance guarded by police. The rioters here were far more bitter and combative, for a simple reason: they were outside, and they wanted inside. They repeatedly charged the police and were repulsed with opaque clouds of tear gas and pepper spray.\n“Fuck the blue!” people chanted.\n“We have guns, too, motherfuckers!” one man yelled. “With a lot bigger rounds!” Another man, wearing a do-rag that said “fuck your feelings,” told his friend, “If we have to tool up, it’s gonna be over. It’s gonna come to that. Next week, Trump’s gonna say, ‘Come to D.C.’ And we’re coming heavy.”\nLater, I listened to a woman talking on her cell phone. “We need to come back with guns,” she said. “One time with guns, and then we’ll never have to do this again.”\nAlthough the only shot fired on January 6th was the one that killed Ashli Babbitt, two suspected explosive devices were found near the Capitol, and a seventy-year-old Alabama man was arrested for possessing multiple loaded weapons, ammunition, and eleven Molotov cocktails. As the sun fell, clashes with law enforcement at times descended into vicious hand-to-hand brawling. During the day, more than fifty officers were injured and fifteen hospitalized. I saw several Trump supporters beat policemen with blunt instruments. Videos show an officer being dragged down stairs by his helmet and clobbered with a pole attached to an American flag. In another, a mob crushes a young policeman in a door as he screams in agony. One officer, Brian Sicknick, a forty-two-year-old, died after being struck in the head with a fire extinguisher. Several days after the siege, Howard Liebengood, a fifty-one-year-old officer assigned to protect the Senate, committed suicide.\nRight-wing extremists justify such inconsistency by assigning the epithet “oath-breaker” to anyone in uniform who executes his duties in a manner they dislike. It is not difficult to imagine how, once Trump is no longer President, his most fanatical supporters could apply this caveat to all levels of government, including local law enforcement. At the rally on December 12th, Nicholas Fuentes underscored the irreconcilability of a radical-right ethos and pro-police, pro-military patriotism: “When they go door to door mandating vaccines, when they go door to door taking your firearms, when they go door to door taking your children, who do you think it will be that’s going to do that? It’s going to be the police and the military.”\nDuring Trump’s speech on January 6th, he said, “The media is the biggest problem we have.” He went on, “It’s become the enemy of the people. . . . We gotta get them straightened out.” Several journalists were attacked during the siege. Men assaulted a Times photographer inside the Capitol, near the rotunda, as she screamed for help. After National Guard soldiers and federal agents finally arrived and expelled the Trump supporters, some members of the mob shifted their attention to television crews in a park on the east side of the building. Earlier, a man had accosted an Israeli journalist in the middle of a live broadcast, calling him a “lying Israeli” and telling him, “You are cattle today.” Now the Trump supporters surrounded teams from the Associated Press and other outlets, chasing off the reporters and smashing their equipment with bats and sticks.\nThere was a ritualistic atmosphere as the crowd stood in a circle around the piled-up cameras, lights, and tripods. “This is the old media,” a man said, through a megaphone. “This is what it looks like. Turn off Fox, turn off CNN.”\nAnother man, in a black leather jacket and wraparound sunglasses, suggested that journalists should be killed: “Start makin’ a list! Put all those names down, and we start huntin’ them down, one by one!”\n“Traitors to the guillotine!”\n“They won’t be able to walk down the streets!”\nThe radicalization of the Republican Party has altered the world of conservative media, which is, in turn, accelerating that radicalization. On November 7th, Fox News, which has often seemed to function as a civilian branch of the Trump Administration, called the race for Biden, along with every other major network. Furious, Trump encouraged his supporters to instead watch Newsmax, whose ratings skyrocketed as a result. Newsmax hosts have dismissed covid-19 as a “scamdemic” and have speculated that Republican politicians were being infected with the virus as a form of “sabotage.” The Newsmax headliner Michelle Malkin has praised Fuentes as one of the “New Right leaders” and the groypers as “patriotic.”\nAt the December 12th rally, I ran into the Pennsylvania Three Percent member whom I’d met in Harrisburg on November 7th. Then he had been a Fox News devotee, but since Election Day he’d discovered Newsmax. “I’d had no idea what it even was,” he told me. “Now the only thing that anyone I know watches anymore is Newsmax. They ask the hard questions.”\nIt seems unlikely that what happened on January 6th will turn anyone who inhabits such an ecosystem against Trump. On the contrary, there are already indications that the mayhem at the Capitol will further isolate and galvanize many right-wingers. The morning after the siege, an alternative narrative, pushed by Jones and other conspiracists, went viral on Parler: the assault on the Capitol had actually been instigated by Antifa agitators impersonating Trump supporters. Mo Brooks, an Alabama congressman who led the House effort to contest the certification of the Electoral College votes, tweeted, “Evidence growing that fascist ANTIFA orchestrated Capitol attack with clever mob control tactics.” (Brooks had warmed up the crowd for Trump on January 6th, with a speech whose bellicosity far surpassed the President’s. “Today is the day American patriots start takin’ down names and kickin’ ass!” he’d hollered.) Most of the “evidence” of Antifa involvement seems to be photographs of rioters clad in black. Never mind that, in early January, Tarrio, the Proud Boys chairman, wrote on Parler, “We might dress in all BLACK for the occasion.” Or that his colleague Joe Biggs, addressing antifascist activists, added, “We are going to smell like you, move like you, and look like you.”\nNot long after the Brooks tweet, I got a call from a woman I’d met at previous Stop the Steal rallies. She had been unable to come to D.C., owing to a recent surgery. She asked if I could tell her what I’d seen, and if the stories about Antifa were accurate. She was upset—she did not believe that “Trump people” could have done what the media were alleging. Before I responded, she put me on speakerphone. I could hear other people in the room. We spoke for a while, and it was plain that they desperately wanted to know the truth. I did my best to convey it to them as I understood it.\nLess than an hour after we got off the phone, the woman texted me a screenshot of a CNN broadcast with a news bulletin that read, “antifa has taken responsiblitly for storming capital hill.” The image, which had been circulating on social media, was crudely Photoshopped (and poorly spelled). “Thought you might want to see this,” she wrote.\nIn the year 2088, a five-hundred-pound time capsule is scheduled to be exhumed from beneath the stone slabs of Freedom Plaza. Inside an aluminum cylinder, historians will find relics honoring the legacy of Martin Luther King, Jr.: a Bible, clerical robes, a cassette tape with King’s “I Have a Dream” speech, part of which he wrote in a nearby hotel. What will those historians know about the lasting consequences of the 2020 Presidential election, which culminated with the incumbent candidate inciting his supporters to storm the Capitol and threaten to lynch his adversaries? Will this year’s campaign against the democratic process have evolved into a durable insurgency? Something worse?\nOn January 8th, Trump was permanently banned from Twitter. Five days later, he became the only U.S. President in history to be impeached twice. (During the Capitol siege, the man in the hard hat withdrew from one of the Senate desks a manual, from a year ago, titled “PROCEEDINGS OF THE UNITED STATES SENATE IN THE IMPEACHMENT TRIAL OF PRESIDENT DONALD JOHN TRUMP.”) Although the President has finally agreed to submit to a peaceful transition of power, he has admitted no responsibility for the deadly riot. “People thought that what I said was totally appropriate,” he told reporters on January 12th.\nHe will not disappear. Neither will the baleful forces that he has conjured and awakened. This is why iconoclasts like Fuentes and Jones have often seemed more exultant than angry since Election Day. For them, the disappointment of Trump’s defeat has been eclipsed by the prospect of upheaval that it has brought about. As Fuentes said on the “InfoWars” panel, “This is the best thing that can happen, because it’s destroying the legitimacy of the system.” Fuentes was at the Capitol riot, though he denies going inside. On his show the next day, he called the siege “the most awe-inspiring and inspirational and incredible thing I have seen in my entire life.”\nAt the heap of wrecked camera gear outside the Capitol, the man in the leather jacket and sunglasses declared to the crowd, “We are at war. . . . Mobilize in your own cities, your own counties. Storm your own capitol buildings. And take down every one of these corrupt motherfuckers.” Behind him, lights glowed in the rotunda. The sky darkened. At 8 p.m., Congress reconvened and resumed certifying the election. For six hours, Americans had held democracy hostage in the name of patriotism.\nThe storm might be here. ♦\nBy signing up, you agree to our User Agreement and Privacy Policy & Cookie Statement.\nSections\nMore\n© 2021 Condé Nast.
