Shallowford Rd, Suite B, Dunwoody, GA 30338, USA\nThe number of undocumented immigrants (UIs) varies worldwide, and most reside in the United States. With more than 12 million UIs in the United States, addressing the health care needs of this population presents unique challenges and opportunities. Most UIs are uninsured and rely on the safety-net health system for their care. Because of young age, this population is often considered to be healthier than the overall US population, but they have specific health conditions and risks. Adequate coverage is lacking; however, there are examples of how to better address the health care needs of UIs.\nBoth nationally and internationally, medical care of undocumented immigrants (UIs) is a growing issue. Although definitions of who is undocumented vary internationally, in the United States UIs include individuals born outside the United States who are not legal residents. This definition includes those who have entered the country without documents or authorization, those who were legally authorized to enter but remain after their visa has expired, and those whose application for immigrant status has not been resolved.1\nAlthough it is challenging to determine exact figures, recent estimates show that UIs make up roughly 4% of the US population, amounting to approximately 12 million individuals. Most of this group is of Hispanic origin (64%) (See Figure 4 at Henry Kaiser Family Foundation, Health Coverage of Immirgants: https://www.kff.org/disparities-policy/fact-sheet/health-coverage-of-immigrants/) and 90% are adults between the ages of 18 and 40 years. More than 4 million people in the United States are the US-born children of UIs. About half of UIs are of Mexican origin; however, these numbers have declined over the last 5 years, from more than 6 million to 5.6 million as of 2014. California, Texas, and Florida have the largest numbers of UIs, and Nevada has the largest share, making up 8% of the state’s population.2, 3, 4, 5\nThe issue of UIs is not unique to the United States. Internationally, the United Nations Population Division estimates that there are 30 million to 40 million unauthorized immigrants worldwide, and although most are in the United States, proportionally continental Europe has a larger share.6 Although UIs have a variety of reasons to migrate, from safety concerns to economic incentives, addressing the health needs of these populations come with unique challenges and solutions. This article provides an overview of challenges in addressing their health needs, existing methods for accessing care, health conditions specific to this population, and potential solutions to consider in both the national and international contexts, specifically in Europe.\nDespite the better health status of the younger UI population, this advantage deteriorates over increasing time spent in the United States.7 Various factors from socioeconomic status to fear of deportation affect the UI population’s health both domestically and internationally and deter UIs from seeking care. The UI population is often of lower socioeconomic status, which adds to the difficulties accessing health care. Given that most of the federal insurance plans are unavailable to the UI population, UIs are susceptible to higher out-of-pocket costs for care. In addition, because of undocumented status, they may not have sick leave days and may have difficulty negotiating time off from work to seek care.8\nDecreased proficiency in the language of the host country and fear of deportation may also present barriers to health care for UIs. Studies have shown that patients with limited English language proficiency (LEP) are at higher risk of poor health and have decreased access to health care. Patients who have LEP had increased difficulty in understanding their health status as well as accessing preventive services.9 Fear of deportation may lead to the avoidance of seeking care and risk of severe health complications,8 and this also affects health care for US-born children of UIs. In addition, shame and discrimination are common feelings experienced by the UI population and contribute to poor access to health care globally.8\nMany of these issues in health care are not unique to the United States. In a study by Chauvin and colleagues,10 22% of the UI population in Europe had access to health coverage, and, of those, only about 36% had true access because of barriers such as administrative difficulties, limited language proficiency, and lack of awareness of available services. Of the main reasons for lack of access, administrative difficulties in obtaining health care and finances were cited as the most common. France and Belgium were found to have the most complicated systems for obtaining health care and, for those who had access, the fear of deportation or imprisonment was prevalent.\nThe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA), passed in 2010, required most US citizens and legal residents to have health insurance, and resulted in the expansion of Medicaid in 32 states. UIs are not eligible for Medicaid or state-based exchanges under this law.11 Thus, although the number of overall uninsured in the United States has decreased, it is mostly US citizens and legal residents who have gained access to health insurance.12\nIn 1986, Congress approved the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA), requiring hospitals to provide services for active labor and emergency care regardless of insurance and immigration status. In addition to EMTALA, there is emergency care under Medicaid, which is currently the only federal insurance that is available to UIs. Emergency Medicaid covers patients in active labor and those with acute medical emergencies.13 It may only be used to stabilize patients and may not cover patients for services after the patient has been stabilized.\nFederal provisions available to UIs include prenatal care and care for children funded by Maternal and Child Health Block grants and the Supplemental Food Program for Women, Infants and Children. In 2009, the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) was expanded under the CHIP Reauthorization Act (CHIPRA). In 2015, federal funding for CHIP was expanded to states, which included the standard Medicaid benefit package such as the Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnostic, and Treatment services for medically necessary mental health and dental services, vaccinations and prescription drugs, and access to medical specialists and hospital care and services. Although these resources are available for a vulnerable subset of UIs, there are few resources that exist for sick, nonpregnant adults.12\nFederally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) are community health centers that receive federal grant funding to support care to the uninsured without regard for immigration status. There are approximately 1200 health centers operating around the country, providing primary health care, dental, mental health, and pharmacy services on a sliding-scale basis. In addition, there are many low-cost and free community clinics that rely on private donations and volunteers to provide services to those who cannot afford to pay.14\nEurope faces similar challenges regarding access to health care for its UI population. The Platform for International Cooperation on Undocumented Migrants (PICUM) reported that Italy and Spain provided the widest coverage for UI with universal access to health care.10 Germany, Greece, Sweden, and Switzerland only cover emergency care for UIs.10\nTable 1\nprovides an overview of access to care for UIs in Europe.15\nHealth care access to undocumented migrants in 7 European countries\nAbbreviations: AME, State Medical Assistance; NHS, UK National Health Service.\nThere is ongoing political debate in the United States regarding health care services for UIs. Those in opposition maintain that using taxpayer-funded services to support individuals who enter and remain in the United States illegally undermines the legal system. However, some scholars and legislators have argued that it is both unethical and impractical to deny access to health care services for illegal immigrants living in the United States.16 They view health care as a basic human right and an obligation of a just society to provide health care for everyone. Leading medical professional societies such as the American Medical Association (AMA), American College of Physicians (ACP), the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP), and the American Nurses Association (ANA) reaffirm the position that all individuals living in the United States, regardless of their immigration status, should have access to quality health care, including the opportunity to purchase insurance. These leaders maintain that providing this population with access to health insurance is an evidence-based way to reduce health care costs.17, 18, 19\nAnother argument, from a cost perspective, is that many UIs will benefit from preventive care and early treatment of chronic diseases before they advance to life-threatening and costly complications.20, 21 Proponents of this strategy advocate for improving health literacy and vaccination rates, and offering health screenings to the UI population to try to prevent long-term adverse health outcomes and control cost. Moreover, UIs may harbor infections such as tuberculosis (TB), which, when undetected, can easily be transmitted to the general public, thus posing a public health risk.22\nIn contrast, some have argued that treating UIs creates more expenditures for the United States while saving their countries of origin the costs of providing health care.23 Furthermore, they argue that sharing inadequate health care resources with UIs will reduce the availability of those scarce resources for US citizens. In the last 2 decades, several states have attempted to advance legislation designed to deny UIs access to publicly funded health services. One such initiative was California’s Proposition 187. This law, later deemed unconstitutional, required health care professionals to verify immigration status and report UIs to authorities.24\nIn addition, some believe that continued unabated treatment of UIs is an incentive for persistent violation of the immigration laws and threatens national security in the post-9/11 era.25 Proponents of this argument suggest that denying health care to UIs will discourage others from attempting to immigrate without proper documentation.24\nThere are significant gaps in the literature on the health status of the UI population. Immigrants in general, and the undocumented in particular, report lower levels of cancer, heart disease, arthritis, depression, hypertension, and asthma than do the native born.26 Factors thought to contribute to lower rates of reported chronic diseases include the young immigrant population and the process of migration, which, especially in cases of undocumented individuals, positively selects for those healthy enough to make the often arduous journey (ie, the so-called healthy immigrant effect).7, 26 In addition, little is known about the long-term health of the children of UIs, particularly related to the adverse effects of inadequate prenatal care and the stressors related to undocumented status, which has been shown to negatively affect children regardless of their own legal status.12\nMost of the emergency health care services used by UIs are for childbirth. A study of emergency Medicaid expenditures for undocumented and recent immigrants in North Carolina between 2001 and 2004 found that more than 82% of health care spending was related to childbirth and complications of pregnancy. Of the remaining health care expenditures, one-third was spent on the treatment of acute injuries and poisoning, possibly related to exposure to pesticides or other toxins in the workplace.27 These uses of health care services reflect not only the young age of most UIs but also the type of work that they perform.28 Beyond pregnancy and acute injury, chronic renal failure, cerebrovascular disease, and heart disease were major contributors to emergency Medicaid use.27\nVarious factors associated with undocumented status are thought to erode the health advantage of the undocumented at a faster rate than their documented counterparts. Specifically, limited access to quality health care; increased vulnerability caused by low income and occupational status; and the stressors associated with undocumented status, such as fear of deportation, have been implicated.29 In addition, UIs with chronic and infectious medical conditions are negatively affected because of poor access to care.30, 31, 32\nPerinatal health of undocumented women and their US-born children is a specific area of concern. Consistent with much of the health literature, several studies have found that undocumented women engage in few health risk behaviors while pregnant and seem to have low rates of low-birth-weight or preterm babies.33, 34, 35, 36 However, the beneficial effects of better health behaviors during pregnancy are counteracted by the effects of lower rates of prenatal care among UIs. Poor (and late) prenatal care has been associated with higher risk for adverse perinatal outcomes.36, 37\nIn addition, stressors related to undocumented status, such as fear of deportation or experiences of discrimination and stigma, may adversely affect the physical and emotional health of UIs, with potential consequences for their US-born children.38, 39 Findings from a qualitative study of 85 immigrant families experiencing the arrest of at least 1 parent by immigration authorities, showed an increase in the children’s behavioral problems, speech and developmental concerns, and declines in school performance.40\nThere is a public health concern over UIs bringing infectious diseases into the United States. Legal immigrants and refugees are required to have a medical examination for migration to the United States, while they are still overseas. This examination is the responsibility of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which provide instructions to the panel physicians who conduct the medical examinations. The procedure consists of a physical examination, an evaluation (skin test/chest radiograph examination) for TB, and a serologic evaluation for syphilis. Requirements for vaccination are based on recommendations from the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices.41\nIndividuals who fail the examination because of certain health-related conditions are not admitted to the United States. Such conditions include drug addiction or communicable diseases of public health significance, such as TB, syphilis, gonorrhea, leprosy, and a changing list of current threats such as polio, cholera, diphtheria, smallpox, or severe acute respiratory syndromes.42 There is a growing concern that UIs crossing into the United States illegally could bring any of these threats. The most prevalent infectious diseases are hepatitis B, latent and active TB, filariasis, intestinal helminth infections, malaria, intestinal protozoa infections, hepatitis C, other nonparasitic infections, sexually transmitted diseases, and human immunodeficiency virus.43\nLittle is known about the mental health issues of UIs. However, the literature suggests that UIs have a unique risk profile that may contribute to different mental health outcomes compared with their documented counterparts. Themes specific to UIs include failure in the country of origin, dangerous border crossings, limited resources, restricted mobility, marginalization/isolation, stigma/blame and guilt/shame, vulnerability/exploitability, fear and fear-based behaviors, and stress and depression.44\nOne study compared the diagnoses and mental health care use of undocumented Latin American immigrants (15%) with those of documented (73%) and US-born Latin Americans (12%) treated in this clinical setting. The undocumented Latin Americans were more likely to have a diagnosis of anxiety, adjustment, and alcohol abuse disorders. The UIs also had a significantly greater mean number of concurrent psychosocial stressors compared with documented immigrants and US-born groups, and they were more likely to have psychosocial problems related to occupation, access to health care, and the legal system.45 Other studies have shown increasing rates of substance abuse, binge-eating, and conduct disorders among UIs residing longer in the United States.7\nThe European immigrant population comes from many different countries, with a heavy concentration from countries in Africa, the Middle East, and the former Soviet Union. The most commonly reported health care problems in this undocumented migrant population include mental health, infectious and sexually transmitted diseases, and reproductive health. Concerns about human trafficking, particularly of women and children, for commercial sexual exploitation or forced labor or slavery are more prominent in Europe.15\nDespite the contentious debate over the ACA, a consensus has emerged that strengthening primary care will improve health outcomes and restrain the growth of health care spending. Supporting evidence comes from studies of primary care as an orientation of health systems and as a set of functions delivered by a usual source of care.46 Although methodological concerns exist, many observational studies in the United States have found that regions with higher primary care physician-to-specialist ratios have better health outcomes, including lower mortality; fewer emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and procedures per capita; and lower costs.46\nInternational comparisons between industrialized countries also suggest that countries with higher ratings of primary care orientation experience better health care outcomes and incur lower health care costs than countries with lower degrees of primary care orientation.46 These finding suggest that reducing barriers to primary care for UIs may ultimately improve the quality and cost of delivering health care for all countries struggling to manage their growing immigrant populations.\nSeveral US cities and states with large immigrant populations have attempted to address their health care needs by providing access to primary care. New York City has the nation’s largest public health system, composed of the Health and Hospitals Corporation (HHC) and Community Health Care Association of New York State, whose members include FQHCs and migrant health programs. These organizations provide much of the health care for uninsured and undocumented patients. Both systems rely on Medicaid (and, to a lesser extent, Medicare) reimbursements. They also depend on federal Disproportionate Share Hospital funding and other sources of state Indigent Care Pool funding. In addition to primary and preventive health care, HHC ambulatory centers offer uninsured patients access to on-site pharmacies and referrals to medical specialists and diagnostic and other services located in HHC medical centers.47\nCalifornia offers a Medi-Cal health insurance plan that provides a full range of low-cost health care options for uninsured Californians, with some benefits provided regardless of immigration status. In addition, Kaiser Permanente offers a Child Health Program for uninsured California children younger than 19 years who do not have access to Medi-Cal or other coverage, regardless of immigration status. My Health LA (MHLA) is a no-cost health care program that offers comprehensive health care for low-income, uninsured Los Angeles county residents, regardless of immigration status or medical condition. It offers care through 164 community clinic medical home sites, where patients receive primary and preventive health care services and some diagnostic services. Los Angeles County Department of Health Services facilities also provide county clinic medical home sites, plus emergency, diagnostic, specialty, inpatient services, and pharmacy services. Healthy San Francisco (HSF) is a low-income program for San Francisco County residents regardless of employment status, immigration status, or medical condition. Unlike MHLA, HSF charges a participation fee and point-of-service fee to all patients except for those at less than 100% of the federal poverty level and those who are homeless.47\nThe Harris County Health System, which includes the city of Houston, Texas, offers Access Care, a financial assistance program open to uninsured and undocumented Harris County residents, and provides access to discounted health care at more than 20 community clinics, a dental clinic, and surgical and other subspecialty clinics. The Harris Health System has a dialysis clinic as well as a long-term care facility.47\nIn Massachusetts, all immigrants are eligible for some form of health coverage. There is 1 application for all available programs, including the insurance marketplace. Mass Health Limited is the state version of emergency Medicaid. It is available to UIs and some immigrants who are PRUCOL (Permanent Residence Under Color of Law), defined as aliens who are living in the United States with the knowledge and permission of the federal government, and whose departure the agency does not contemplate enforcing.47\nIn Nevada, the nonprofit Access to Healthcare Network (AHN) offers medical discount programs, specialty care coordination, a health insurance program, nonemergency medical transportation services, a pediatric hematology/oncology practice, and a toll-free statewide call center. AHN has 35,000 members, more than half of whom are presumed to be undocumented.47\nA study by Hacker and colleagues8 identified 5 areas to address barriers to care for UIs: advocacy for policy, insurance options, expansion of the safety net, training of providers, and education of UIs on navigating the system (Table 2\n).\nRecommendations for improving barriers\nNearly all industrialized countries provide some form of government-supported health care to all of its residents, including those who are undocumented (see Table 1). Although countries in the European Union have significantly fewer UIs, their models may offer insights on the options and challenges of addressing this health care dilemma facing the United States.\nMedical care for UIs is a complex area involving challenges for accessing care, barriers in financing care, and unique medical conditions. Fear, stigma, cost, and cultural barriers often prevent UIs from seeking medical care. UIs make up a small but substantial portion of the population in the United States and internationally, and there is an emerging interest in finding solutions to address their health care needs. In the United States, cities with large numbers of immigrants have models that provide health care to their uninsured regardless of immigration status, and could potentially be expanded to other areas of the country experiencing increasing growth of their immigrant populations. International approaches may also inform on policies to address the health care needs of UIs.\nThis article originally appeared in Primary Care: Clinics in Office Practice, Volume 44, Issue 1, March 2017.Disclosure: The authors have no financial disclosures.\nThis article originally appeared in Primary Care: Clinics in Office Practice, Volume 44, Issue 1, March 2017.\nDisclosure: The authors have no financial disclosures.",

            "report_content": "Immigration & emigration statistics\nMigrants – particularly in lower paid jobs and in irregular situations – may be both more affected by and vulnerable to the spread of COVID-19, but migrants also play an important role in the response to COVID-19 by working in critical sectors. As of 10 October 2021, emigrants from the 20 countries with the highest number of COVID-19 cases accounted for 33 per cent of the total international migrant stock and they had sent an estimated 41 per cent of all remittances globally to their countries of origin in 2020 (GMDAC analysis based on UN DESA, 2020; World Bank 2021a; WHO, 2021)1. Immigrants accounted for at least 3.7 per cent of the population in 13 of the 20 countries with the highest number of COVID-19 cases, and this share is more than 8 per cent in 9 of these countries (GMDAC analysis based on UN DESA, 2020; WHO, 2021). Compared to the global share of international migrants making up 3.6 per cent of the total population, international migrants are overrepresented in these countries.\nThis page discusses data on migrants that can inform how they are potentially both affected by the impact of COVID-19 and are part of the response to the pandemic. As information related to the COVID-19 pandemic is constantly evolving, figures and other data will be updated on a regular basis. For information by country, please see here and below the map for key indicators on migration and demography. For key trends by region on the impact of COVID-19, please see our regional data overviews.\nCOVID-related restrictions have an impact on the mobility of migrants and the role of humanitarian organizations. Between 10 March 2020, a day before the WHO declared COVID-19 a pandemic, and 4 October 2021, 109,591  movement restrictions were implemented around the world (IOM, 2021a). At the same time, 201 countries, territories or areas have issued 998 exceptions to these restrictions, thus enabling mobility (ibid.).  Assuming zero-growth in the number of migrants between 1 March and 1 July 2020, estimates suggest a decrease of nearly 2 million international migrants compared to the initially expected increase between mid-2019 and mid-2020 (UN DESA, 2020).\nIn 2020, permanent migration inflows to OECD countries are estimated to have fallen by more than 30  per cent and 2020 was a historical low for migration to OECD countries since 2003 (OECD, 2021). Among all categories of permanent migration to OECD countries, partially available data show that family migration experienced the largest decline in 2020 by more than 35 per cent (ibid.).\nSuch a drop in migration inflows due to COVID-related restrictions can also have demographic effects on countries dependent on migration for population growth. For example, national data for 2020 suggest that the population of Germany did not grow for the first time in the last decade due to a decline in immigration (German Federal Statistics Office, 2021a). As of the end of 2020, the total number of foreign nationals in Germany had risen by 1.8 per cent, the lowest rate in the last decade (German Federal Statistics Office, 2021b). In Australia, higher migration outflows than inflows in 2020/2021 is projected to lead to the lowest population growth in a century (Australian Centre for Population, 2020).\nInternational students have also been affected by mobility restrictions in both origin and destination countries. The number of first permits issued by OECD countries to international students dropped significantly in 2020 as a result of COVID-19. For example, the United States of America and the United Kingdom -- the most popular destination countries for international students -- issued 69 per cent and 40 per cent fewer first permits to students in 2020 respectively compared to 2019 (OECD, 2021).\nLow-skilled labour migrants in crowded dormitories have been disproportionately affected by the pandemic. Examples from Saudi Arabia and Singapore, where the Ministries of Health have provided official data on the migration status of individuals who tested positive, show the differential exposure to the virus of the migrant population. According to the Saudi Ministry of Health, 75 per cent of all newly confirmed cases as of 7 May 2020 were among migrants. In Singapore, over 95 per cent of the confirmed cases by 19 June 2020 were among migrants, with over 93 per cent of the total cases being related to migrants’ dormitories (Singapore Ministry of Health, 2021). Despite a downward trend in the number of new cases, as of 5 July 2021, cases among residents of dormitories continued to account for more than 87 per cent of the cumulative number of cases in Singapore (ibid.). However, due to the exponential rise in COVID cases among those not resident in dormitories in the third quarter of 2021, the share of cases in dormitories dropped to 54 per cent relative to the overall number of cases in Singapore (ibid.).\nAs international migrants are a highly heterogenous group, the effects on their health are also varied. A rapid systematic review of publications found that the incidence rates among migrants and forcibly displaced persons appear to be consistently higher than among non-migrant groups (Hintermeier et. al., 2020). However, all studies included in this review focused on migrant and forcibly displaced persons who were at a higher risk of becoming infected due to their living and working conditions (ibid.). Another review of peer-reviewed literature, national datasets and grey literature by Hayward et. al. (2020) also shows that migrants in high-income countries are at increased risk of infection and death due to COVID-19. In addition to migrants’ living and working conditions, the study also attributes this disproportionate representation of migrants to limited access to healthcare (ibid.) (see section on migration governance). Even though the incidence rates of COVID-19 are higher among migrants in several countries, comparing the data is also challenging due to national differences in demographics and data collection (Laczko, 2021).\n169 million people were estimated to be migrant workers in 2019 (ILO, 2021). 24.2 per cent of all migrant workers globally were hosted in Northern, Southern and Western Europe, and another 22.1 per cent were hosted in Northern America. More than two in five migrant workers were hosted in these regions and were among the first to be affected by lay-offs and movement restrictions and lockdowns impacting livelihoods such as losing their businesses. As evidenced in the previous section, living conditions in crowded housing pose a particular risk to the spread of COVID-19 among migrant workers.\nThe unemployment rates of migrants increased significantly in more than 75 per cent of all OECD countries in 2020 (OECD, 2021). An analysis of monthly data from the US Census Bureau shows that, from May to July 2021, the drop in the number of employed immigrants was steeper than the number of employed US-born adults compared to the same period in 2019 (Capps et al., 2021). Although data on unemployment rates disaggregated by migratory status is not available at a nationally representative level, analysis of data collected by IOM’s Displacement Tracking Matrix (DTM) shows that the unemployment rates of Venezuelans in Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador and Peru were higher than the unemployment rates among the populations of the destination countries (Chaves-González et al., 2021).\nBeyond unemployment, the share of immigrant workers living in poverty in OECD countries – despite being employed – was highest in Southern European countries and the United States in 2017/18. The in-work poverty rates in Spain and the United States in 2018 were 32.1 and 24.8 per cent respectively and it was 29.1 per cent in Italy in 2017 (OECD, 2019b). Such migrants were disproportionately affected during the peak of the COVID-19 crisis when unemployment rates of citizens increased but measures to mitigate the effects did not include migrants.\nMigrants, regardless of where they work, make important contributions to address the pandemic but are also exposed to higher risks of contracting the virus. As an illustration, among the 20 countries with the highest number of COVID-19 cases as of 10 October 2021, available international data for 2015/16 show that at least 6 countries – the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Spain, Italy and Germany– depended on foreign-born workers in the critical sector of healthcare services (OECD, 2019). On the higher end, 33 per cent of doctors and 22 per cent of nurses in the United Kingdom in 2015/6 were foreign-born (ibid.).\nMigrants constitute a significant share among sectors that are critical as well as sectors that are most affected by the crisis: For example, in 6 of the 20 countries with the highest number of COVID-19 cases as of 10 October 2021, more than 10 per cent of all services and sales workers were foreign-born. Additionally, available data show that more than 9 per cent of all skilled agricultural, forestry and fishery workers in 5 of these countries were foreign-born (GMDAC analysis based on OECD DIOC, 2015/16). On average, 13 per cent of all key workers in the European Union (EU) are immigrants (Fasani and Mazza, 2020). In 2017, the United States had recruited 161,583 foreign workers on seasonal work permits (OECD, 2019) and seasonal workers in countries in the EU are often undercounted. An estimated 69 per cent of all migrants in the United States work in critical infrastructure sectors (Center for Migration Studies, 2020 based on 2018 US Census Bureau data).  In most of the OECD countries highly affected by the crisis, women make up between three and five out of seven of the foreign-born workers in the services and sales sectors (GMDAC analysis based on OECD DIOC, 2015/16). The lockdowns in many countries can have disproportionate implications on the socioeconomic status of migrant women, who are overrepresented in these sectors among all migrant workers.\nCountry\n% foreign-born workers among all services and sales workers, 2015/16\n% women among foreign-born services and sales workers, 2015/16\n% foreign-born workers among skilled agricultural, forestry and fishery workers, 2015/16\n% women among foreign-born skilled agricultural, forestry and fishery workers, 2015/16\nUnited States of Americaa\n23.3\n78.8\n46.3\n27.2\nSpain\n19.5\n58.9\n11.3\n5.3\nItaly\n19.0\n72.3\n11.0\n16.8\nGermany\n18.4\n58.8\n9.6\n11.7\nFrance\n13.8\n59.5\n6.7\n26.1\nUnited Kingdomb\n13.8\n11.0\n16.8\n78.5\nPolandb\n0.9\n42.2\n0.4\n52.3\nMexicob\n0.6\n41.5\n0.3\n11.3\nSource: GMDAC analysis based on OECD DIOC, 2015/16\na Occupational data for the US are coded with US SOC codes and therefore are not directly comparable with data for the other countries in the above table which are coded with ISCO-08 codes.\nb Since data are disaggregated by foreign-born, native-born and unknown, the percentages reflected here might be underestimates.\nThere were an estimated 11.5 million migrant domestic workers (MDWs) around the world in 2013, approximately 8.5 million of whom were female (ILO, 2015). In times of COVID 19, their employers may be infected and pass the disease on, perish with the worker losing their income since work permits are often tied to the employer. With border closures and economic constraints, returning to countries of origin is often not possible, trapping migrant domestic workers in destination countries without housing and income (see section on data disaggregated by sex below).\nAn estimated 41 per cent of total remittance inflows globally in 2019 as well as in 2020 were received in the 20 countries with the highest number of confirmed COVID-19 cases as of 10 October 2021 (GMDAC analysis based on World Bank, 2021).  Globally, 9 of the 20 countries with the highest number of COVID-19 cases – the United States of America, India, the United Kingdom, the Russian Federation, France, Italy, Germany, Poland and Malaysia – were among the 20 countries from which the highest amounts of remittances were sent in 2020. Remittances sent from these nine countries alone made up more than 23 per cent of all global remittances received in 2020 (ibid.).\nBefore the COVID-19 crisis started, the World Bank (2019) had projected that 574 billion USD will be sent to low- and middle-income countries by the end of 2020, but job losses and difficulty to send remittances during shutdowns will significantly affect recipients dependent on these remittances for their financial stability. In April 2020, Ratha et al. (2020a) estimated that remittances to low- and middle- income countries (LMICs) will fall to 445 billion USD in 2020, a decline of 20 per cent compared to 2019. In October 2020, Ratha et al. (2020b) adjusted their forecasted decline to LMICs to 508 billion USD in 2020 and a further decline to 470 billion USD in 2021. However, the latest data show that remittance flows to LMICs fell by only 1.7 per cent to USD 549 billion, defying projected declines that would have been the sharpest in recent history (Ratha et. al, 2021). Annual projections for 2021 expect remittance flows to LMICs to recover and increase by 7.3 per cent to USD 589 billion (ibid.).\nOil-producing countries in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) are an important destination for migrants from South Asia and East Africa. As many international migrant workers in the GCC states returned to their origin countries (see section on return migration below), sending remittances to their families is no longer possible. Since one in nine people around the world depend on remittances sent by migrant workers, COVID-19 impacts migrant families and communities in terms of remittance-supported nutrition, health, education and income, which in turn may lead to potential setbacks on progress made on several of the UN SDGs. It should however be noted that remittances are private funds and cannot replace Official Development Assistance and other public spending.\nData from countries that are major recipients of remittances highlight the nuanced trend behind these variations. After an initial dip in the first half of 2020 (mostly in March and April), remittances appear to have rebounded to pre-COVID-19 rates and historical highs in several countries. For example, Pakistan – where remittance inflows accounted for nearly 8 per cent of the GDP in 2019 – saw the highest amount of monthly remittances historically in July 2020 (State Bank of Pakistan, 2020). In countries such as Mexico and Nepal, monthly remittances in the second, third and fourth quarters of 2020 increased to amounts higher than the previous year for the same period.\nSeveral factors could be behind this trend: currency fluctuations paired with the effect of countries coming out of strict lockdowns – during which time usual household spending was limited and savings were higher – may have played an important role in the dip and rebound. Emerging economies faced sharp currency depreciation in February-March 2020 whereas the currencies of advanced economies were generally strong during the same period. This may have led to the usual amount of remittances sent getting converted to higher amounts in the receiving countries. The financial behaviour of migrants in times of crises could also be a factor, with migrants sending lockdown savings to support their families in countries heavily affected by the COVID-19 outbreak, but also vice versa, with families supporting migrants in countries affected. Additionally, migrants who returned to their countries of origin may also have transferred their savings through official channels before returning.\nDue to the travel restrictions and border closures imposed by governments globally, several migrants – including seasonal workers and international students – were stranded and unable to return to their countries of origin. As of 13 July 2020, IOM’s Return Task Force had identified at least 3 million stranded migrants (IOM, 2020). Of these, more than 1.2 million migrants were stranded in the IOM region of Middle East and North Africa (ibid.).\nWith migrants losing jobs and facing higher risks of being infected due to their often overcrowded living conditions, many workers are returning to their countries of origin, often with the help of bilateral negotiations that allow borders to be temporarily opened to return stranded migrants. Globally, India is the country of origin with the largest number of emigrants (UN DESA, 2020) and as of 12 October 2021, India’s official repatriation operation had facilitated the return of nearly 2.7 million stranded Indians from around the world (Indian Ministry of Civil Aviation, 2021). More than 1.6 million undocumented Afghans returned from Iran and Pakistan between 1 March 2020 and 2 September 2021. Of these, 117,145 Afghans had returned in the first two weeks of March 2020 alone (IOM, 2021d). As of 30 October 2020, more than 136,000 Venezuelan migrants and refugees had returned to Venezuela from other countries in the region (IOM and UN OCHA, 2020). At its peak, 600 Venezuelans returned from Colombia daily and an average of 88 Venezuelans returned from Brazil daily via the border at Pacaraima (Coordination Platform for Refugees and Migrants from Venezuela, 2020). Between 1 April 2020 and 26 March 2021, IOM had assisted more than 62,000 migrants who were in quarantine facilities after returning to Ethiopia from neighbouring African countries and Saudi Arabia (IOM, 2021e). Additionally, through the COVID-19 Return Task Force, IOM had assisted 1,100 migrants to return to their countries of origin in 2020 (IOM, 2021f).\nData collected by IOM’s DTM between 13 March 2020 and 18 August 2021 show that internal mobility restrictions in countries around the world had an impact on regular travellers and nationals in 60 per cent and 61 per cent respectively of the internal transit points assessed (2021g). Among 33,393 respondents of a study by the Mixed Migration Centre (2021), nearly 28 per cent reported that the pandemic had made it difficult to cross borders and another 25 per cent reported that it had affected internal mobility. With lockdowns leaving internal migrants unemployed and homeless, thousands of workers in the informal sector returned from cities such as New Delhi, India, to their hometowns (UN, 2020).\nSuch exoduses of migrant workers – both international and internal migrants – have two main effects on the countries and places of origin: increased health vulnerabilities (Zenner and Wickramage, 2020) and socioeconomic pressure. In addition to the direct economic effects of lost remittances (see section above), studies show that international remittances from migrants to their families reduce child labour and keep children at school (ILO-UNICEF, 2020). With the projected loss of USD 109 billion in remittances due to COVID-19, more children are at risk of being forced into child labour.\nConversely, return migration also affects the former countries of destination that are dependent on migrant workers in essential sectors (see section on labour migration). Migrants made up an estimated 19 per cent of the population in Germany, 15 per cent in the United States of America and Spain, 14 per cent in the United Kingdom and 13 per cent in France at mid-year 2020 (all among the top 20 countries with the highest number of COVID-19 cumulative cases, as of 10 October 2021) (UN DESA, 2020), where they are also overrepresented in essential sectors such as healthcare and services.\nApproximately one in five international migrants were estimated to live in just 20 cities - Beijing, Berlin, Brussels, Buenos Aires, Chicago, Hong Kong SAR, China, London, Los Angeles, Madrid, Moscow, New York, Paris, Seoul, Shanghai, Singapore, Sydney, Tokyo, Toronto, Vienna and Washington DC (IOM, 2015). For 18 of these cities, international migrants represented around 20 per cent of the total population (ibid.). The share of foreign-born persons in the total population in some cities exceeds the global average (around 3.4% in 2015) by a large margin (IOM, 2015). Dubai had a foreign born population of close to 83 per cent, while in Brussels it is 62 per cent, in Toronto 46 per cent and Melbourne 35 per cent, to name a few examples (ibid.).\nIncome inequality and marginalization affect local patterns of COVID-19 prevalence. For instance, while positive cases have been recorded throughout New York, most confirmed cases were in areas with the lowest median incomes, despite the limited local availability of testing. This is likely due to structural factors linked to living and working conditions preventing people from applying basic prevention and mitigation measures. More than 35 per cent of the population in New York in 2018 were foreign-born and publicly available data from the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene show that migrants were overrepresented in all but 1 of the 10 areas most affected by COVID-19 in the city (in terms of positive cases per 1000 residents).\nCOVID-19 and related global movement restrictions have also affected displaced persons. UNHCR’s estimation model compared to their forecasts shows that approximately 1.5 million fewer refugees and asylum-seekers arrived in 2020 than would have been expected without COVID-19 (2021). Globally, the number of new asylum applications lodged in the first half of 2020 was 32 per cent less than the number during the same period in 2019 (OECD et. al., 2020). In OECD countries, the drop in number of new asylum applications was 31 per cent in 2020 compared to 2019 (OECD, 2021). The European Union saw a nearly 34 per cent decrease in first-time asylum applications in 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 (Eurostat, 2021a) However, the number of first-time asylum applications had increased by 9 per cent and 115 per cent in the first and second quarters of 2021 respectively compared to the same time period in 2020 (Eurostat, 2021b).\nThe 20 countries with the highest number of confirmed COVID-19 cases as of 10 October 2021 hosted about 7.4 million refugees, or more than 35 per cent of refugees worldwide by the end of 2020 (GMDAC analysis based on WHO, 2021 and UNHCR, 2021). Of these 20 countries, Turkey, Germany, the Islamic Republic of Iran, France, and the US were among the top 20 refugee-hosting countries according to data by UNHCR for the end of 2020 (ibid.). Additionally, the United States of America, Turkey, Germany, Brazil, South Africa, France and Spain were among the 10 countries with the highest number of pending asylum applications as of the end of 2020 (ibid.). Despite the 1 million drop in asylum claims globally, nearly 21,000 unaccompanied or separated children had applied for asylum in 2020 (UNHCR, 2021). As of 31 December 2020, more than 270,000 Venezuelans had pending asylum claims in the US, Brazil, Colombia, Spain, Mexico and Argentina (ibid.).\nDespite the mobility constraints posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, migrants continue to embark on clandestine journeys, fleeing violence and poverty and seeking to improve their lives. COVID-19 responses have increased the risks and uncertainty of these journeys, pushing people into more perilous situations where humanitarian support and rescue may not be available. Some 7,130 people lost their lives during migration between 1 March 2020 and 5 October 2021, according to data from IOM’s Missing Migrants Project (MMP). Not included in this total are the thousands of deaths linked to COVID-19 cases among migrant workers and deaths related to mobility restrictions and lockdowns.\nAmidst the pandemic, at least 4,320 people lost their lives attempting to reach Europe on maritime routes between 1 March 2020 and 5 October 2021. The Central Mediterranean has remained the most dangerous irregular migration corridor worldwide – more than 2,050 people are known to have died on this route between 1 March 2020 and 5 October 2021.\nIn the first nine months of 2021, there has been a substantial increase in the number of people who died on maritime routes to Europe compared with 2020. From January to September 2021, at least 2,425 people lost their lives, which is a substantial increase compared to the fatalities recorded in the same period in 2020 (1,290) and 2019 (1,310). COVID-19 related measures continue to impact search and rescue efforts, with new imposed restrictions on the operations of civilian (NGO-run) vessels and denying or delaying disembarkation at safe ports in multiple instances.\nMeanwhile, conflict and poverty exacerbated by measures to counter the COVID-19 pandemic, have compelled increasing numbers of people to embark on the extremely perilous journeys on the Western African Atlantic route from the coast of Senegal, Mauritania and Morocco to Spain’s Canary Islands. Since September 2020, there has been an increase in crossings of the this route. At least 21,167 people arrived in the Canary Islands between September 2020 and January 2021 alone, compared with 2,456 in the previous five months of 2020 and 4,929 in the five-month period from February to June 2021. These numbers are still far below a peak in 2006, when 32,000 people arrived to the islands by boat from the coast of Africa. However, the trauma and risk of death that this dangerous crossing presents are concerning. Between March 2020 and 5 October 2021, MMP recorded the deaths or disappearances of at least 1,670 people on the migration route to the Canary Islands, 250 of which occurred in 2021. This figure is considered a severe undercount of the real number of lives lost on this route; NGOs have reported that the real number of migrant deaths on the route to the Canary Islands in the first six months of 2021 could be as high as 2,000.\nThe crisis of “invisible shipwrecks” on maritime routes to Europe, cases where a boat is reported missing, often by family members of those on board, but no survivors are found, has been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. This is due to persistent search and rescue gaps as well as increased barriers for data sharing, which has made cases even more difficult to verify. In 2020, MMP collected evidence on 13 invisible shipwrecks involving hundreds of people, and there are strong indications that migrants continue to go missing without a trace in 2021. Some of the most significant evidence of this has been the human remains recovered on the Algerian coast (mostly near Aïn Témouchent, Oran, Mostaganem) signalling possible invisible shipwrecks on the Western Mediterranean route.\nCOVID-19 restrictions in South-Eastern Asia have meant hundreds of Rohingya migrants attempting to leave Myanmar have become stranded at sea as States refuse to allow them to disembark due to fears of infection. While it is difficult to know the true death toll on these stranded boats, one of them left an estimated 70 dead in April 2020 after the boat was refused entry to any country for more than two months. Another similar situation in February 2021 left at least 8 Rohingya migrants dead and 1 missing. During the 2015 Bay of Bengal crisis, which saw Rohingya boats similarly stranded, IOM documented more than 500 deaths at sea.\nThe UN Sustainable Development Goals call for ensuring that no one is left behind, including migrants. Different age groups face varying vulnerabilities as both migrants and as part of a certain period in life. Globally, about 12 per cent of all international migrants are 65 years and older. However, in 11 of the 20 countries with the highest number of confirmed cases, persons aged 65 years and older represent a lower share in the international migrant stock compared to their share in the general population. India, Brazil, the Russian Federation, France, Argentina, Poland, South Africa, the Philippines and Ukraine are the countries where this is an exception. In 15 of the 20 countries with the highest number of confirmed cases, between 60 per cent and 84 per cent of migrants are estimated to be of working age (between 20 and 64 years old) (GMDAC analysis based on WHO, 2021 and UN DESA, 2020). Migrants are thus more likely to be either young or of working age and are part of the response by working in critical sectors. They are also at risk of being exposed to COVID-19 by working in sectors where home-based work is not possible (see section on labour migration for detailed analysis).\nMigrants in countries with the highest number of cumulative COVID-19 cases, as of 10 October 2021\nCountry\nShare of migrants in total population (%), mid-2020\nShare of working age migrants (20-64 years) in migrant stock (%), mid-2020\nShare of persons 65 years and older in migrant stock (%), mid-2020\nShare of persons 65 years and older in population (%), mid-2020\nUnited States of America\n15.3\n77.2\n14.5\n16.6\nIndia\n0.4\n70.7\n21.6\n6.6\nBrazil\n0.5\n59.3\n15.7\n9.6\nUnited Kingdom\n13.8\n77.4\n11.0\n18.7\nRussian Federation\n8.0\n76.7\n16.9\n15.5\nTurkey\n7.2\n70.9\n5.9\n9.0\nFrance\n13.1\n67.6\n22.6\n20.8\nIran (Islamic Republic of)\n3.3\n51.4\n2.5\n6.6\nArgentina\n5.0\n68.4\n14.2\n11.4\nSpain\n14.6\n80.7\n9.0\n20.0\nColombia\n3.7\n57.6\n2.6\n9.1\nItaly\n10.6\n84.4\n7.1\n23.3\nGermany\n18.8\n70.2\n21.4\n21.7\nIndonesia\n0.1\n78.5\n5.0\n6.3\nMexico\n0.9\n34.8\n4.5\n7.6\nPoland\n2.2\n36.9\n40.8\n18.7\nSouth Africa\n4.8\n81.8\n7.1\n5.5\nPhilippines\n0.2\n60.1\n10.7\n5.5\nUkraine\n11.4\n72.9\n20.3\n16.9\nMalaysia\n10.7\n82.9\n1.5\n7.2\nGlobal average\n3.6\n73.2\n12.2\n10.0\nSource: WHO, 2021 (accessed on 16 October 2021); GMDAC analysis based on UN DESA, 2020\nWomen comprised less than half, 135 million or 48.1 per cent, of the global international migrant stock at mid-year 2020 (UN DESA, 2020). However, more female migrants are migrating independently for work, education and as heads of households. Despite these advances, female migrants may still face stronger discrimination, and are more vulnerable to mistreatment compared to male migrants. In general, the pandemic has led to an increase in gender-based violence (CARE and IRC, 2020).\nNonetheless, men are also exposed to vulnerabilities in the migration processes. Therefore, gender-responsive data on migration have potential to promote greater equality and are key to avoid exacerbated repercussions for disadvantaged groups. Care work also disproportionally rests on women, including caring for those affected by COVID-19 and children in light of day-care and school closures (ibid.). As healthcare workers, female migrants may face an additional burden to their job by having to care for family members at home and at the same time potentially facing stigmatization if in contact with patients infected with COVID-19.\nThe larger presence of men in the international migrant stock is also reflected in the proportion of male migrant workers. In 2019, migrant workers were estimated to be 58.5 per cent male and 41.5 per cent female (ILO, 2021). At 59.8 per cent and 46.7 per cent respectively, the labour force participation rate of migrant women was higher than that of non-migrant women in 2019 (ibid.). In the current global health crisis, female migrant workers may thus be more affected by unemployment than female nationals, and can therefore experience double discrimination as both migrants and as women in their host country.\nAn analysis of Migration Governance Indicators (MGI) assessments conducted between 2018 and 2020 in 84 countries, pre-COVID-19 pandemic, found these countries provide migrants with varying degrees of access to government-funded health services depending on their migratory status. The analysis, which covered 51 countries, showed that a third of these countries provide the same access to health care to both citizens and migrants, regardless of their migratory status. In half of the countries surveyed, equal access to health care is contingent on migratory status. Moreover, 12 per cent of the countries provide migrants with access to some health services only, including emergency health care (IOM, 2019; and Milan and Cunnoosamy, 2020). In most cases, there are no limitations to access to private health care or insurance.\nAnalysis of migration-related data from the United Nations Twelfth Inquiry among Governments on Population and Development - another effort to collect data on SDG target 10.7.2 - also shows that migrants' access to health services can depend on migratory status. The Inquiry, which collected data on 111 countries between late 2018 and early 2019, found that more than three quarters (86 per cent) of governments provide essential and emergency health care to all non-nationals, regardless of their migratory status, while 8 per cent indicate that they provide such services only to those whose status is regular.\nCOVID-19 affects all regardless of nationality, but migrants  are often left out in national pandemic plans due to a lack of data disaggregation by migratory status. A review of pandemic influenza preparedness plans in 21 countries of the Asia Pacific region in 2016 only found 3 countries (Thailand, Papua New Guinea and the Maldives) adequately included non-citizens beyond health control measures at borders (18 out of 21 countries, Wickramage et al., 2018). Excluding migrants’ access to entitlements or access to health care in domestic legal and policy frameworks may increase transmission risks, adverse outcomes and inhibit access to early detection, treatment and negatively affect public health management (Zenner and Wickramage, 2020).\nMost MGI countries do not have a strategy with specific measures to assist migrants before, during, and post-crisis phases. MGI assessment data from 84 countries indicates that there are no such strategies in 65 per cent (55 Countries) of the MGI countries assessed. These measures mainly pertain to internal displacement, refugee movements and humanitarian assistance on an equal footing to nationals and migrants. Measures on maintaining or upscaling health systems during a public health crisis are not specifically mentioned. Nineteen per cent of the countries partially include these types of measures in the sense that their strategies are inclusive of all vulnerable communities (thus informally encompassing migrants). Some countries temporarily relax immigration requirements, allowing migrants whose country of origin has been affected by a crisis to remain in the destination country beyond the usual time limit. In other cases, assistance is provided de facto to all migrants irrespective of their migration status. Only 15 per cent of the countries assessed have specific measures to assist migrants, but several mention that assistance is given on an ad hoc basis.\nConversely, 60 per cent of the countries offer assistance to their nationals abroad in times of crisis. Most of these countries provide emergency travel documents and repatriation possibilities, but only for broadly defined “humanitarian crises”. 38 per cent of the countries that participated in the MGI assessment offer assistance on a case-by-case basis and only where a migrant’s country of origin is represented through consular bodies. In most cases, assistance from the country of origin is limited or even not possible when there are no consulates in the receiving country.\nIn 2% of the assessed MGI countries, there are no specific measures to assist nationals living abroad in times of crisis. Similar to the MGI assessments, the UN Inquiry found that 68 per cent of governments have specific measures to provide assistance to citizens residing abroad in countries in crisis or post-crisis situations.\nIreland carried out a rapid policy survey based on the MGI COVID-19 module in May 2020 to assess the extent to which COVID-19 response policies - whether it be migration, crisis response, health, socioeconomic recovery or other policies - recognize and address the special needs and vulnerabilities of migrants in the country as well as nationals abroad and promote their contributions to the COVID-19 response and the country’s economy. The report highlights access to COVID-19 public medical testing and treatment for all people residing in Ireland, irrespective of their migratory status, among other key findings.\nThough some countries report including migrants in their official National Deployment and Vaccination Plans (NDVPs), IOM has observed that these plans are not always enacted in practice. As of 17 May 2021, 33 per cent of 152 countries reported including irregular migrants in their NDVPs whereas only 28 per cent of the observed 168 countries actually included them in practice. Similarly, 56 per cent of 152 countries reported including refugees and asylum seekers in their NDVPs whereas only 45 per cent of the observed 168 countries actually included them in the roll-out of those campaigns on the ground (IOM, 2021b). Despite a continued lack of clarity on NDVPs regarding migrants’ access to vaccines, more recent data from 10 September 2021 show that 46 per cent of 153 countries included irregular migrants in their NDVPs whereas 38 per cent of the observed 177 countries actually included them in practice. In the case of refugees and asylum seekers, 71 per cent of 153 countries officially included them in their NDVPs, and nearly 69 per cent of the observed 177 countries included them in practice (IOM, 2021c).\nFor detailed analyses of the strengths and limitations of the highlighted data sources, please visit the thematic pages on:\nFor the detailed methodology on IOM’s mobility restrictions tracking, please visit https://migration.iom.int/\n1 The figures on new cases face inconsistencies across countries and may underreport the real extent of case data as official figures are based on tested cases only and as such capacities to test and testing itself varies by country.

            "report_content": "By The Visual Journalism Team  BBC News\nThousands of people are scrambling to flee Afghanistan after the Taliban seized back control of the country, almost two decades after they were ousted by a US-led coalition.\nThe United Nations has warned that up to half a million Afghans could flee the country by the end of the year and has called on neighbouring countries to keep their borders open.\nThe current crisis comes on top of the 2.2 million Afghan refugees already in neighbouring countries and 3.5 million people forced to flee their homes within Afghanistan's borders.\nThe US-led operation to evacuate people by air has now ended, with the last flight taking off from Kabul airport just after midnight on Tuesday - a deadline agreed with the Taliban for foreign forces to withdraw.\nMore than 123,000 civilians were evacuated by US forces and its coalition partners after the Taliban took control of the capital on 14 August - but it's unclear exactly how many of those were Afghan nationals.\nThe US has said that it flew nearly 80,000 civilians out of Kabul and of those, about 5,500 were Americans and more than 73,500 were either Afghans or other foreign nationals.\nWhile the UK Ministry of Defence, which ended its evacuations on Saturday, said it had flown out more than 15,000 people and some 8,000 of them were Afghans.\nAt the height of the operation, the US said its military planes were departing the airport every 39 minutes - although the evacuations did slow down after the suicide bomb attack on the 26 August outside the airport, which killed about 170 people, including 13 American troops.\nMany of those flown out of the country were taken to emergency processing centres set up in several countries, including Spain, Germany, Qatar and Uzbekistan.\nAs many as 300,000 Afghans have been affiliated with US operations in the country since 2001, according to the International Rescue Committee, and tens of thousands of them are eligible to obtain a US visa - but many will now have to find a different way out of the country.\nAt the weekend, the US said it had received assurances from the Taliban that Afghan nationals who are issued with valid travel documents by another country will be allowed to leave Afghanistan.\nThe Taliban control all the main land crossing points with Afghanistan's neighbours (shown on the map below) and reports suggest they are only allowing traders or those with valid travel documents to leave the country.\nHowever, many of those trying to flee because they fear for their safety under Taliban rule will not have any paperwork.\nThe UN has urged Afghanistan's neighbours to keep their borders open to refugees and called on the international community to support those countries.\nBut Uzbekistan, which borders the north of Afghanistan, has said its main crossing point is closed to \"ensure security\" and there are no plans to open it.\nPakistan, which has the longest border with Afghanistan, has also said it will not accept refugees - with its US ambassador telling the BBC: \"We are already overburdened by the refugees, and it is beyond our capacity to host any more refugees.\"\nLast week, satellite imagery of the Spin Boldak crossing point between Afghanistan and Pakistan showed a large crowd of people gathered on the Afghan side.\nThe BBC's Shumaila Jaffery, who was at the crossing point, said it was a chaotic scene with many Afghans not being allowed to enter Pakistan.\nLast Friday, two Afghans were reportedly killed by Pakistani security forces at the Torkham border crossing after trying to enter Pakistan illegally.\nThere have also been reports of thousands of Afghans trying to cross the western border with Iran, but it's unclear how many have been successful.\nThe latest movement of Afghans is part of a historical exodus from a country that has suffered instability and conflict over many years.\nEven before the Taliban retook control, more than 550,000 people had been forced to flee their homes this year due to fighting, according to the UNHCR.\nThat means an estimated 3.5 million Afghans are currently internally displaced within the country.\nIn addition to those within Afghanistan's borders, about 2.2 million refugees and asylum seekers were also seeking sanctuary in neighbouring nations as of the end of last year.\nThis year, Afghans have also had to deal with a severe drought and food shortages across most of the country. A report by the UN World Food Programme (WFP) in June said that 14 million people - more than a third of the population - were suffering from hunger.\nMary-Ellen McGroarty, WFP country director for Afghanistan, said last week that unless emergency food and medical supplies arrived soon, the \"already horrendous situation\" would become \"an absolute catastrophe, a complete humanitarian disaster\".\nNeighbouring countries Pakistan and Iran saw the highest numbers of Afghanistan's refugees and asylum seekers last year.\nAlmost 1.5 million fled to Pakistan in 2020, while Iran hosted 780,000, according to UNHCR figures.\nGermany was third, with more than 180,000, while Turkey took nearly 130,000.\nWhen looking at asylum seeker numbers only - those who have applied for sanctuary in another country but whose claims have not yet been granted - Turkey, Germany and Greece top the list, with about 125,000, 33,000 and 20,000 respectively.\nAlthough there are no Afghan asylum seekers in Iran, those with refugee cards - an official document recognising their status - are able to access the country's health and education systems.\nThe UN has called on its member states to help Afghan people in \"their darkest hour of need\" - but while some countries have offered refugees a safe haven, others have indicated they will not be giving sanctuary to those fleeing the crisis.\nBoth Pakistan and Iran have said that they cannot cope with a further influx of Afghan refugees. Officials in both countries have said that any refugees that do arrive will have to stay in camps near the border until they can return to Afghanistan.\nUzbekistan has said it will help transfer Afghans to third countries but will only host refugees temporarily. The Tajikistan government previously offered to accept up to 100,000 refugees but it's unclear if any have been allowed in yet. Turkmenistan has said its airspace can be used for evacuation flights but it hasn't made any commitment to take in refugees itself.\nIn Turkey, the government has urged European countries to take responsibility for any new migrant crisis, saying Turkey would not be \"Europe's migrant storage unit\". The country has stepped up construction of a border wall with Iran to thwart those entering illegally.\nOfficials in several European Union countries say they are keen to avoid a repeat of the 2015 migrant crisis, when there was a populist backlash against large numbers of Syrian refugees being allowed to enter EU territory.\nFrance, which evacuated more than 2,800 people from Kabul airport, mostly Afghans, has indicated it will accept some refugees but has not specified a number. Germany has also not specified a number but Chancellor Angela Merkel has said as many as 40,000 people still in the country may have a right to be evacuated to Germany if they feel they are endangered.\nOther EU countries, like Austria, Poland and Switzerland have said they will not accept any new Afghan arrivals and are upping their border security to guard against illegal arrivals.\nThe UK has said it will take in 5,000 Afghans in 2021 as part of a scheme to resettle 20,000 over the next few years, focusing on those at greatest risk from the Taliban.\nThe US has not said how many refugees it will accept yet, but it has authorised $500m (Â£367m) for \"unexpected urgent refugee and migration needs of refugees\". Canada has said that it will resettle 20,000 Afghans while Australia has said it will take in 3,000.\nSeveral countries, including Kosovo and Uganda, have also accepted US requests to temporarily accept Afghan refugees before they are resettled elsewhere.\nAfghanistan: Danger lies on Kabul road to freedom\nGay and in Afghanistan: 'I could be killed on the spot'\nUncertain times ahead for Afghan women\nAfghanistan: What is Sharia law?\nWho are the Taliban?\nOmicron spreading at unprecedented rate - WHO\nMore than 100 trapped after fire in HK building\nBullied for being 'effeminate' in China\nA $10bn machine in search of the end of darkness\nA miraculous escape after a factory's collapse\nBullied for being 'effeminate' in China\nDavid Fuller: How police caught a killer.
