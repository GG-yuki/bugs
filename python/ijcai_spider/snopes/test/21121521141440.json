            "report_content": "Two Massachusetts bills that would restrict or limit vaccine exemptions amid an ever-growing population of unvaccinated children in the Bay State drew a sometimes raucous outcry at a public hearing at the State House on Tuesday.\n“We’ve reached an all-time high for religious exemptions across the Commonwealth. They’re up at 500% since the 1980s despite no increase in religious affiliation,” said state Rep. Andy Vargas (D-Haverhill) who filed House bill 3999 titled, “An Act Relative to Vaccinations and Public Health.”\nThe number of religious exemptions for kindergartners in the state has risen from 147 in the 1987-1988 school year to 749 in the 2018-19 school year, according to the Department of Public Health.\nThe bill would completely remove religious vaccine exemptions from state law, requiring all Massachusetts children to be vaccinated unless they have a medical exemption.\nHundreds of people including doctors, public health experts and concerned parents flooded the Gardner Auditorium to offer testimony both for and against the bills, many bringing their young children along.\nThe crowd grew raucous at times, with loud snickering, clapping, booing and cheering, which prompted chastisement from Committee Chairwoman Sen. Joanne Comerford.\nCharlene Mailloux, who cried through her testimony, opposed the bills, saying her son “never returned to quite exactly the boy he was” after he was given five vaccinations as a toddler in 2011.\n“Within hours he was screaming, arching his back, high fever, overnight was inconsolable, within days he stopped talking,” said Mailloux.\nDr. Andrew Zimmerman, a pediatrics professor at UMass Medical School, also opposed the bills, saying, “I’ve met a number of parents who recorded vaccine reactions and in several cases, I witnessed those reactions as they were taking place. Some of the children lost previously acquired speech and social skills.”\nBut Dr. Richard Moriarty, a pediatric infectious disease specialist at UMass Medical School, said, “We need to maintain our immunity at a high level. Right now, there are hot spots in the state where the immunization level for measles vaccine is too low to prevent outbreaks.”\nRabbi Keith Stern of Congregation Beth Avodah in Newton, who spoke in favor of the bill, said, “It is utterly inconceivable to me that any religious community would knowingly profess a series of actions that could cause real harm.”\nThe Community Immunity Act, Senate bill 2359 and House bill 4096 sponsored by Sen. Becca Rausch (D-Needham) and Second Assistant Majority Leader Paul Donato (D-Medford), promotes statewide “herd immunity” by standardizing vaccination requirements for all schools and centralizing a process for getting exemptions through the Department of Public Health.\nSign up for email newsletters",

            "report_content": "Living with Wildlife\nHome → Fish & Wildlife → Wildlife → Living with Wildlife → How to Avoid or Resolve a Wildlife Conflict → Bats\nOn this page:\nFigure 1: Photo Credit - Ty Smedes\nBats are highly beneficial to people, and the advantages of having them around far outweigh any problems you might have with them. As predators of night-flying insects (including mosquitoes!), bats play a role in preserving the natural balance of your property and neighborhood.\nAlthough swallows and other bird species consume large numbers of flying insects, they generally feed only in daylight. When night falls, bats take over. A nursing female little brown bat, for example, may consume her body weight in insects each night during the summer.\nContrary to some widely held views, bats are not blind and do not become entangled in peoples' hair. If a bat comes close to your head, it's probably because it is hunting insects that have been attracted by your body heat. Less than one bat in twenty thousand has rabies, and no bats in Maine feed on blood.\nFigure 2: Drawing Credit - ODFW\nMore than eight species of bats live in Maine, from the common big brown bat (Eptesicus fuscus) to the less common silver-haired bat (Lasionycteris noctivagans) and red bat (Laiurus borealis).\nBats range in length from the two-and-a-half-inch long Eastern pipistrelle (Pipistrellus subflavus), to the six-inch long hoary bat (Lasiurus cinereus).  The hoary bat has a body approximately the size of a house sparrow and a wingspan of 17 inches.\nThe species most often seen flying around human habitation include the little brown bat (Myotis lucifugus) and big brown bat (Eptesicus fuscus, Fig. 1).\nBats are the only true flying mammals. They belong to the mammalian order Chiroptera, which means \"hand-wing.\" The bones in a bat's wing work like those of the human arm and hand (Fig. 2), but bat finger bones are greatly elongated and connected by a double membrane of skin to form the wing.\nFigure 3: Drawing Credit - ODIFW\nBats often capture insects when flying by scooping them into their tail or wing membranes, and then putting the insects into their mouth.\nBack to top\nIn February 2006, some 40 miles west of Albany, N.Y., a caver photographed hibernating bats with an unusual white substance on their muzzles. He also noticed several dead bats.\nThe following winter, biologists at the New York Department of Environmental Conservation received reports of several hundred dead bats in several caves, bats that showed erratic behavior, and bats with white noses. The biologists documented white-nose syndrome in January 2007.\nBiologists have since found sick, dying, and dead bats in unprecedented numbers in and around caves and mines from Virginia to New Hampshire. In some hibernaculum, 90 to 100 percent of the bats have died. By 2010, the disease had spread as far west as Oklahoma and killed more than a million bats.\nWhile they are in the hibernaculum, affected bats often have a white fungus on their muzzles and other parts of their bodies. In 2009, scientists identified the fungus Geomyces destructans as the causative agent of the disease. White-nose syndrome causes hibernating bats to awaken more often during hibernation and prematurely use up fat reserves needed to survive the winter.\nSurveys for White-nose Syndrome conducted at hibernacula in Maine in 2009 and 2010 found no evidence of the fungus.  Unfortunately during 2011 surveys, MDIFW biologists found bats at two sites in Oxford County with visible signs of White-nose syndrome fungus on their wings and muzzles.\nBack to top\nThe safest way to view and enjoy bats is to watch them in action. Bats are fascinating flyers, zigging and zagging about as they chase and eat insects. Little brown bats and Eastern Pipistrelle hunt over water. Big brown bats are often seen hunting along the margins of wooded areas, or silhouetted against the lighter sky as they twist and turn high above the tree canopy.\nIt's also fun to watch bats drink, which they usually do first thing after leaving their day roost. They scoop up mouthfuls of water with their lower jaws as they fly over lakes, streams, ponds, or water troughs. Most bats do not come out to eat or drink in heavy rain or when the air temperature remains below 50 degrees F.\nBack to top\nWith few to no flying insects available to them during winter in Maine, bats survive by hibernating, migrating to regions where insects are available, or a combination of these strategies.\nDuring hibernation, metabolic activities are greatly reduced. A bat's normal body temperature of around 100 degrees F is reduced to just one or two degrees higher than that of the hibernaculum, and the heart rate slows to only one beat every four or five seconds. A hibernating bat can thus survive on only a few grams of stored fat during the five- to six-month hibernation period.\nBanding studies indicate that little brown bats will migrate 120 miles between hibernacula and summer roosts, and, if undisturbed, they occupy the same site year after year. They select areas in the hibernaculum where there is high humidity (70 to 95 percent), and the temperature is 34 to 41 degrees F. Still, there are some species, such as the big brown bat, that can hibernate in relatively exposed situations in buildings where there is considerable fluctuation in temperature. Hibernation lasts until April or early May.\nIt is important not to disturb hibernating (or roosting) bats. If a bat rouses early from hibernation, it must use its fat reserves to increase its body temperature. A single disturbance probably costs a bat as much energy as it would normally expend in two to three weeks of hibernation. If disturbed multiple times, hibernating bats may starve to death before spring.\nBecause some bats hibernate in buildings during the winter months, bat-proof a building only when you are sure no bats are hibernating in it. If bats are found hibernating inside after October 15, they should be left alone until early spring (prior to the birthing period in May) after the weather has warmed enough for insects to be out regularly. Meanwhile, seal all potential entry points into human living spaces, and develop a plan so the exclusion process can be accomplished effectively in spring (see \"Bats Roosting in Buildings\").\nBack to top\nIf you are making a bat house to use in Maine, paint it with multiple coats of flat black exterior latex and place it where it will receive full sun. Maine bats need and seek a home that bakes in the sun –  a nice warm place to raise their young –  and one that lets them decrease their metabolic needs during roosting.\nBuild or buy a bat house that is at least two feet tall and 14 or more inches wide. Bigger is better. A roughened or screen-covered landing platform measuring three to six inches should extend below the house.\nThe house can be single-chambered or multi-chambered, but chambers should be three quarters to one inch wide; including variety in size will provide for the needs of different species.\nThe houses should be caulked during construction and (preferably) screwed rather than nailed. The idea is to create a tight microclimate inside the house, one capable of trapping both the heat of the day and the warmth generated by the bats themselves.\nPlace the house in full sun, preferably on its own pole; the next-best location is on the southern side of a building in full sun. The optimal temperature range is between 85 and 104 degrees F. Do not put it on a tree, which provides too much shade and is too close to hawk and owl perch sites. Keep the area around the entrance clear of obstructions for 20 feet.\nDon't worry that adding a bat house to your property will encourage bats to move into your attic or wall space. If bats liked your attic or wall spaces, they would probably be living there already.\n(See \"Additional Information and Resources\" for more information about bat house design, placement, and maintenance.)\nBack to top\nFor some people bats don't present a problem. For others, bats can be a worry, especially when they become unwanted guests in an attic, inside a wall, or in living space.\nUnlike rodents, bats have only small teeth for eating insects, so they do not gnaw holes in walls, shred material for nests, chew electrical wiring, or cause structural damage to buildings. Bats therefore cause minimal damage, but they can be noisy and alarming, and the smell of bats and their droppings can be offensive. It is possible to learn to coexist with bats and to benefit from their presence.\nBat droppings: Bats defecate before entering buildings and places where they roost. In buildings where there is an attic roost or a roost in a wall, an accumulation of droppings may fall through cracks and stain ceilings and walls. Insects associated with bat droppings rarely bother humans.\nDroppings are usually the size of a grain of rice, crumble easily between the fingers, and contain shiny, undigested bits of insects. The droppings of mice are much harder and more fibrous.\nBat sounds: Bats often squeak before leaving their roost at night, and may chatter on hot days when they move around seeking refuge from the heat. Baby bats separated from their mothers will squeak continuously. All these sounds are loud enough to be heard from a distance of up to thirty feet. Thus, an increase in such noises near dusk probably indicates bats.\nRats, mice, flying squirrels, opossums, or raccoons – rather than bats – may be causing scrambling, scratching, and thumping sounds in attics and walls at night. Swifts (birds similar to swallows) can in rare instances make chirping and  rustling sounds in a chimney at night.\nBat odors: Bats produce a musky solution from their scent glands and their roosts may take on a strong musky odor. Areas occupied by rats and mice also often have a musky smell.\nFigure 4: Drawing Credit - Land Mammals of Oregon\nSide view of a big brown bat skull (See Fig. 4) Unlike rodents, bats do not gnaw holes in walls, shred material for nests, chew electrical wiring, or cause structural damage to buildings.\nLike other wild animals, bats will seek shelter in an attic, wall, chimney, or other suitable area. Bats are able to squeeze through surprisingly narrow slits and cracks; the smaller species need only a half-inch opening. Sometimes when homeowners discover bats in the attic, they feel that they have a crisis that needs immediate attention. In fact, they may have been coexisting with the bats for many years.\nTrapping and relocating bats is not recommended. Traps can be fatal to bats if left unattended and can quickly become overcrowded. In addition, bats have excellent homing instincts and, when released, they may simply return to the capture area.\nPrior to excluding bats, consider partitioning bats off from the area where they are in conflict with humans, and allowing them to roost elsewhere in the structure. An effective partition can be made from construction grade plastic sheeting and wooden battens. Another consideration is to provide an alternate roost site, such as a properly designed and installed bat house mounted close to one of their exits. Install the bat house before excluding the bats as described below.\nThe best way to get rid of bats, and also the safest for bats and humans, is to exclude them. However, because old buildings offer many points of entry – as do buildings with shake or cedar shingle roofs with no underlayment -- it may be impossible to exclude them completely. You can hire a wildlife damage control company experienced in excluding bats or you can do the work yourself. In attics and areas where large numbers of bats have been roosting for years, it is safer to hire a professional to do the work (including the cleanup of accumulated droppings) than to do it yourself.\nNote: Never trap flightless young or adult bats inside a structure; this is needlessly cruel to the bats inside and can create a serious odor problem (see Bats in the Winter for important information about when not to exclude bats).\nOption A – Build bats out:\nFrom mid-October to mid-March, when bats should still be hibernating, or after you have made sure no bats are roosting in the attic or other area, seal all potential entry holes (see Fig. 5). If possible, enter the attic during the day and look for light shining through cracks and holes. Insert pieces of fiberglass insulation or bits of stick in these holes to mark them for repair from the outside.\nSeal off large openings with aluminum flashing, wood, or quarter-inch mesh hardware cloth. Stuff small holes around pipes, cracks, and gaps in shakes and tiles with balled-up galvanized window screening, pieces of fiberglass insulation, copper Stuff-it®, or copper or stainless-steel mesh scouring pads. (Steel wool will corrode quickly after becoming wet). Use weather-stripping, caulk, or expandable foam, seal spaces around doors, windows, and vents. Replace loose boards and roofing materials. Close the damper in the fireplace.\nIf you use caulk or expandable foam, apply it early in the day so that it is set up and no longer sticky when bats inspect the area in the evening. If there are large areas to be foamed, it may be worth purchasing a foam gun of the type used in building construction. Foam is very messy to use, so wear gloves when applying it, and don't get it on your clothes or skin.\nFigure 5: Drawing Credit - BCI\nCommon entry points used by bats: Down chimneys and where chimneys and other masonry meet the side of a house; joints between window frames and house siding; joints around large exterior beams; at building corners; where pipes or wires penetrate the ceiling or walls in attics; between porches or other additions and the main house; at roof edges, ridge caps, soffits, and fascia boards; where walls meet eaves at the gable ends of an attic; in gaps under shingles.\nThe advantage of caulk over foam is that it comes in a variety of colors and it is easier to apply. Before purchasing, check the label to make sure the caulk can be painted.\nInsulation blown into wall spaces may be an effective barrier, but it must be done when bats are absent to avoid trapping them in the fill.\nIf bats are present, holes can also be blocked over a period of days early in the evening after the bats have left the structure to feed. Do this only from mid-August to mid-October (after the young bats have learned to fly and before cold weather arrives). Another window of opportunity occurs in early spring, before the birthing period  in May.\nFor several days, bat counts should be made as holes are closed, leaving the main exit open. On the night of the final count after the bats have left, the main hole should be plugged to prevent their reentry. The following evening, remove the plug to allow any remaining bats to leave before you seal the exit.\nOption B – Harassment:\nIf bats must be excluded, persuade them to move to one of their alternate roost sites by creating an undesirable atmosphere. Again, there are two windows of opportunity: from mid-August to mid-October, after the young bats have learned to fly and before cold weather arrives; and in early spring, before the birthing period in May.\nBats don't like to roost in areas with bright, windy, or noisy conditions. Therefore, locate the area where bats are roosting and light the area with a bright light, such as a mechanic's drop-light or trouble light, located away from burnable objects. (Use a fluorescent light to save on electricity and keep the heat level down) In addition, aim a fan and a loud radio at the bats. Begin the harassment process shortly before dark and keep it in place day and night. Because bats may move to a dark, protected area, you may need to move the lights and other equipment, or install them in various areas. Putting up sheets of plastic to separate the bats from the rest of the area can be effective, but make sure you don't block the bats' exit or exits.\nCommercially available ultrasonic devices may be effective if they are placed in a small, confined area with roosting bats. Bats can hear high frequency sounds; these devices, inaudible to humans, supposedly bombard the bat's range with jackhammer-like noise.\nDo not use naphthalene flakes or mothballs, which contain chemicals that can be toxic to humans and other life forms; poisoned bats may fall to the ground where they die slowly and are more likely to come into contact with children or pets.\nIf the exclusion process was successful, immediately seal up the exits to prevent bats from reentering. If necessary, install a chimney cover, available from home improvement centers.\nOption C – Install exclusion devices:\nAgain, from mid-August to mid-October (after the young bats have learned to fly and before cold weather arrives), or in early spring (before the birthing period in May), identify the exit(s) bats are using. Have friends or family members stationed at the corners of the structure after sunset on a warm calm night. They need to be far enough away to see as much of the building as possible without having to turn their heads; it takes only a second for a bat to exit and take flight. Observers should note from which side of the house – and, on subsequent nights, exactly where – bats exit the structure. Remember that the hole can be as small as half an inch.\nBats often defecate when exiting and reentering a building, so look closely for rice-sized black droppings clinging to the side of the structure. If you see droppings, you will find the exit hole directly above it. (To make sure droppings are new, remove existing droppings or lay down newspaper over them to see if more appear) Bat body oils may also discolor a well-used opening.\nSeal all entry holes but one using the methods described in Option A. Exclude bats by covering the one existing entry hole with a device that allows bats to exit the structure, but prevents them from reentering (see Figs. 6–10). Install the exclusion devices during the day and leave them in place for five to seven days (longer during particularly cool or rainy weather).\nWhen bats are using multiple openings to exit and enter, exclusion devices should be placed on each opening, unless you can be sure that all roosting areas used by the bats are connected. If all the roosting areas are connected, all but one or two exit holes can be sealed as described below. Place exclusion devices over the one or two remaining exit holes.\nFigure 6: Drawing Credit - BCI\nIf the colony contains a hundred bats or more, which is common, leaving only one exit point can create a bat \"log jam.\" In this case, some bats might look for alternative ways out of the roost area, finding their way into human-occupied areas. It is important to make sure bats are able to exit freely. If they do not appear to be exiting, or appear to be having trouble doing so, open additional exits.\nAfter all bats have been excluded, remove the exclusion devices and immediately seal up the exits to prevent bats from reentering. If necessary, install a chimney cover, available from home improvement centers.\nA one-way door (Fig. 6) allows bats to exit a structure, but prevents them from reentering. Hang a sheet of construction grade plastic, screen-door material, or lightweight polypropylene netting (half-inch mesh) over the exit. Use staples or duct tape to attach the material to the building. The one-way door should extend 18 to 24 inches below the bottom edge of the opening. Leave the material loose enough to flop back after each bat exits.\nFigure 7: Drawing Credit - BCI\nOne-way tubes (Fig. 7) work where one-way doors won't, such as on horizontal surfaces. A flexible pipe or cardboard tube is easy to fit into a crevice or cut to create flaps that can be fit over an opening and be stapled, nailed, or taped to a building.  Do not let the tube project more than a quarter-inch into the opening to make sure that bats can easily enter the tube.\nOne-way tubes should be at least two inches in diameter, 10 inches in length, and have a smooth interior so bats are unable to cling to the inside (Fig. 8). One-way tubes can be made from PVC pipe, flexible plastic tubing, empty caulking tubes, or dryer vent hose (Fig. 9). To reduce the likelihood of bats reentering, a piece of plastic sheeting can be taped around the exit end of the tube.\nSome areas have lengthy crevices used by bats. Multiple exclusion tubes will need to be placed every few feet along the length of each crevice; spaces between the tubes should be closed with heavyweight netting or other material. The same procedure can be used in lengthy crevices created where flashing has pulled away from a wall.\nFigure 8: \nDrawing Credit - BCI\nFigure 9: \nDrawing Credit - BCI\nFigure 10a: \nDrawing Credit - BCI\nFigure 10b: \nDrawing Credit - BCI\nFigure 10c: \nDrawing Credit - BCI\nBats temporarily roost above porches or under overhangs at night to eat large prey, digest, rest, and socialize. In such cases, they may frighten humans or their droppings may accumulate.\nMylar balloons or strips of aluminum foil hung from the porch ceiling and allowed to move in the breeze may discourage bats from roosting in the area. Nontoxic aerosol sprays, designed to repel dogs and cats, can prevent bats from night-roosting in these areas; apply the spray by day when bats are not present. This treatment is reported to be effective for up to several months. (Aerosol repellents are not an adequate substitute for excluding bats that are using the area as a day roost, and should never be applied when bats are in a roost)\nBack to top\nLarge accumulations of bat droppings may harbor histoplasmosis fungi spores, which when inhaled can result in a lung infection referred to as \"histo.\" No histo cases have been reported in Maine, but precautions should be followed when cleaning or removing large accumulations of bat droppings. Call your local health department for recommendations.\nPeople are more often concerned about bats because of rabies, a virus that affects the nervous system of humans and all other mammals. If you do not handle bats, your odds of contracting rabies are extremely small.\nRabies is spread when the saliva of an infected animal enters the body through a bite or scratch, or makes contact with the eyes, nose, mouth, or break in the skin. There is little risk of contracting rabies from a bat as long as you exercise caution. People cannot get rabies from touching bat droppings, blood, urine, or fur.\nFive to ten percent of bats that the Maine State Department of Health tests have rabies. The department estimates, however, that probably less than one percent of the native wild bat population has the disease.\nIf a bat does contract rabies, it is unlikely to be a threat as long as people follow simple precautions. Most bats infected with rabies become paralyzed and fall to the ground. If you pick up a sick bat – and it bites you in self-defense – you risk contracting the disease. If you refrain from picking up a (sick) bat, you avoid exposing yourself.\nNote: Young bats also fall to the ground when learning to fly. They may also have hit a window and been stunned, or simply be cold and unable to fly.\nIf you think you have been bitten, scratched, or exposed to rabies via a bat:\nIn Maine, the law requires pet owners to vaccinate their dogs yearly and their cats every other year. All cats, even indoor cats, should be vaccinated for rabies.\nEach year, the National Association of State Public Health Veterinarians publishes guidelines that unequivocally state if an unvaccinated animal comes in contact with a potentially rabid animal, and the potentially rabid animal cannot be tested, then the unvaccinated animal should be either euthanized  or be held in strict quarantine for six months.\nAs few people are willing to do either, the message is clear: Vaccinate your pets!\nIn spring and fall, migrating bats may temporarily roost outside on window screens, fence posts, piles of lumber, and other unlikely places. If a bat is seen roosting outside during daylight hours, leave it alone. It will probably be gone the following morning.\nIf a bat flies into your home it's probably a juvenile learning to fly, a solitary male following prey, or an adult that has been excluded from its roost. Bats often enter through an open door or window, or by coming down a chimney into an unused fireplace. If a bat is found inside during the day, confine it to one room. Place a towel under doors to prevent the bat from moving into other parts of the house. Leave the area alone until nightfall.\nAt nightfall (if you are sure the bat has not been in contact with humans or pets), turn off any lights in the room where the bat is confined, open all doors and windows that lead outside, and stand in the corner. This allows you to watch the bat while staying out of its way (If you must move around the room, stay as near to the wall as possible). Be prepared to watch the bat for up to 20 minutes. Normally, the bat will fly around the room to orient itself and then leave.\nIf the bat seems to have disappeared but you haven't seen it leave, it may be perched somewhere, such as behind a curtain, in hanging clothes, or in a houseplant. The bat will generally choose a high place to roost. Moving these things around with a broomstick may arouse the bat. If the bat doesn't leave, it can be caught and removed.\nFigure 11: Drawing Credit - BCI\nApproach the bat slowly (Fig. 11) and place a container such as a small box, large glass, plastic bowl, or coffee can over it. Next, gently slide a piece of cereal box paper or cardboard underneath the bat (be gentle—bats are fragile animals). Using the paper as a cover, take the bat outside  and release it away from people and pets. The ideal method is to place the container against a tree, slowly slide the paper away, and then remove the container. Releasing the bat against a tree allows the bat to rest safe from potential predators.\nYou may also use leather gloves and a pillowcase (Never handle a bat with your bare hands). Put your gloved hand inside the pillowcase and gently place the cloth over the bat. Then fold the pillowcase over the bat so it is inside. Take the bat outdoors and safely release it on a rough tree trunk or lightly shake the pillowcase until the bat flies off. In the absence of a container or pillowcase and gloves, use a thick towel. Roll the bat up gently and release it outside.\nNote: State wildlife offices do not provide bat removal services, but they can provide names of individuals or companies that do. To find such help yourself, look up \"Animal Control,\" \"Wildlife Control,\" or \"Pest Control\" in your phone directory. Bats can be caught and released outdoors away from people and pets.\nBack to top\nMany Maine bat species are protected under the Endangered Species Act; for more specific information, contact your regional wildlife office. In addition, all species of bats are classified as protected wildlife and cannot be hunted, trapped, or killed. The Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife makes exceptions for bats found in or immediately adjacent to a dwelling or other occupied building. In such cases, no permit is needed to legally remove the animals.\nBack to top\nLandscaping for Wildlife in the Pacific Northwest\nWritten by: Russell Link \nSeattle: University of Washington Press and the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife, 1999.\nLiving with Wildlife in the Pacific Northwest\nWritten by: Russell Link \nSeattle: University of Washington Press and the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife, 2004.\nStokes Beginner's Guide to Bats\nWritten by: Kim Williams, Rob Mies, Donald Stokes, and Lillian Stokes \r\n\t\t\t\tLittle, Brown and Company, 2002.\nThe Bat House Builder's Book\nWritten by: Merlin D.

            "report_content": "2020\n2021\nBy conveyance\nNational responses\nVaccines\nOther variants\nBy country\nThe COVID-19 pandemic, which was first reported in the city of Wuhan, Hubei, China, in December 2019, has led to an increase in acts and displays of Sinophobia, as well as prejudice, xenophobia, discrimination, violence, and racism against people of East Asian and Southeast Asian descent and appearance around the world. With the spread of the pandemic and formation of hotspots, such as those in Asia, Europe, and the Americas, discrimination against people from these hotspots has been reported.[1][2][3]\nIn the past, many diseases have been named after geographical locations, such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome and Zika virus, but in 2015, the World Health Organization introduced recommendations to avoid this practice, to reduce stigma. In accordance with this policy, the WHO recommended the official name \"COVID-19\" in February 2020.[4]\nIn early coverage of the outbreak, some news sources associated the virus with China in a manner that contributed to stigma. The journal Nature later published an apology for this type of coverage.[4][5] However, even after the majority of politicians had switched to avoiding stigmatizing language when referring to the virus, a minority continued.[4]\nFollowing the progression of the outbreak to new hotspot countries, people from Italy (the first country in Europe to experience a serious outbreak of COVID-19) were also subjected to suspicion and xenophobia,[6][7] as were people from hotspots in other countries. Discrimination against Muslims in India escalated after public health authorities identified an Islamic missionary (Tablighi Jamaat) group's gathering in New Delhi in early March 2020 as a source of spread.[8] As of late April 2020, Paris had seen riots break out over police treatment of marginalised ethnic groups during the then in-place lockdown.[9] Racism and xenophobia towards southern and south east Asians increased in the Arab states of the Persian Gulf.[10][11][12] South Korea's LGBTQ community was blamed by some for the spread of COVID-19 in Seoul.[13][14] In China, some people of African descent  were evicted from their homes and told to leave China within 24 hours, due to disinformation that they and other foreigners were spreading the virus.[15] This racism and xenophobia was criticised by some foreign governments, diplomatic corps, and the Chinese ambassador to Zimbabwe.[16]\nThe US embassy in Yaoundé issued a travel warning to US citizens amid reports of \"... verbal and online harassment, stone throwing, and banging on vehicles occupied by expatriates\". Some residents of Cameroon thought that Europeans and Americans brought COVID to Africa.[17]\nAccording to the Embassy of Japan in Cairo, store clerks have been hesitating to serve Japanese customers, and \"corona\" has also become a new slur with which to abuse Japanese people on the street.[18]\nOn 10 March 2020, an Uber driver was arrested after a viral video showing the driver forcibly removing his Chinese passenger at a highway in Cairo's Maadi district on suspicion of having the virus. In the video, a voice is heard in the video jokingly shouting \"The first coronavirus case in Egypt!\" and the same voice then tells the driver \"May God support you, Hajji! Throw him out!\". The incident has sparked outrage among Egyptians after the video was uploaded. Some Egyptians visited the Chinese man in his hotel and expressed an apology to him for the incident, widely condemned in the local media as an act of bullying and racism.[19][20]\nViolence towards foreigners has been reported amidst the pandemic, with some locals attacking foreigners on social media by publishing photos of them and linking them to the coronavirus. The Foreign Correspondents Association of Ethiopia had warned that \"dangerous rumours\" and \"vicious posts\" were being spread on the internet about foreign journalists, while other foreigners had been physically attacked.[21]\nA video reportedly recorded in Kibera, Kenya in March 2020 shows an angry crowd threatening a man and a woman of East Asian descent about the coronavirus. A man in the crowd shouts at the frightened couple, \"You are corona!\" A motorcycle rider from the crowd later raised his hand threatening to slap the Asian man. Growing unease towards Chinese immigrants has been reported in the streets of Nairobi and its environment especially towards construction workers.[22]\nAn alleged Kenyan member of parliament posted in a Facebook message that his constituents had the right to stone and chase away any Chinese visitors who were not quarantined.[23] A Kenyan taxi driver told the BBC that Chinese nationals had been changing their usernames on taxi hailing apps to avoid their passenger requests being declined.[24]\nGeopolitical analyst Ovigwe Eguegu[25] reported that \"a plethora of conspiracy theories, and videos of Asians (some Chinese) eating bats, and other exotic animals\" on Nigerian social media has led to increased Sinophobia.[26]\nAn ethnic Chinese man in Johannesburg told Deutsche Welle that violent comments such as \"wipe the Chinese people out\" and \"hope this virus gets all of them\" have been expressed in the country by locals.[27] Additionally, one of the earliest reactions of the South African government with regard to COVID-19 prevention was to build a forty-kilometer (25 mi) fence on the border with Zimbabwe. This action was intended to \"ensure that no undocumented or infected persons cross into the country\", according to Public Works Minister Patricia de Lille.[28] In February 2021, the Director of The Jesuit Institute South Africa, Father Russell Pollitt, criticized as potentially xenophobic Health Minister Dr. Zweli Mkhize's announcement that COVID-19 vaccine distribution would be limited to only South African citizens.[29]\nThe Bangladeshi government has sent dozens of Rohingya refugees, who had remained stranded at sea for several weeks, to Bhasan Char, an uninhabited island in the estuary of the Meghna river. Hundreds more remain stranded on two overcrowded trawlers between Bangladesh and Malaysia. Human rights groups have criticised the Bangladeshi and Malaysian governments for using the coronavirus pandemic as a pretext to send away refugees.[30]\nThere have been instances of Wuhan natives in other provinces being turned away from hotels, having their ID numbers, home addresses and telephone numbers deliberately leaked online or dealing with harassing phone calls from strangers. Some places also reportedly had signs saying \"people from Wuhan and cars from Hubei are not welcome here.\"[31] Many hotels and guesthouses refrained from people who had addresses in Wuhan.[32] Multiple hotels purportedly refused to check-in a Wuhan tour guide after she returned to Hangzhou from Singapore with one of them calling the police to give her a health check and asking the police to quarantine her. Amidst these incidents, various cities and prefectures outside of Hubei adopted resettlement measures for Hubei people in their region such as designated hotel accommodation for visitors from the province.[33] In Zhengding, Jingxing and Luquan of Shijiazhuang City, the local governments rewarded anyone who reported those who had been to Wuhan, but not recorded in official documents at least 1,000 yuan RMB. In Meizhou, residents reporting people entering from Hunan were awarded thirty face masks.[34]\nIt was reported that on a scheduled 27 January China Southern Airlines flight from Nagoya to Shanghai, some Shanghainese travellers refused to board with 16 others from Wuhan. Two of the Wuhan travellers were unable to board due to a fever while the Shanghainese on the spot alleged that the others had taken medicine to bypass the temperature check.[31] One of the Wuhan tourists protested on Weibo, \"are they really my countrymen?\" which a Shanghai tourist who was purportedly at the scene replied that they did it to protect Shanghai from the virus.[33] Many netizens criticized the Wuhan tourists for travelling with a fever, although some also called for understanding and for Shanghainese not to regionally discriminate.[35][36]\nIn March and April 2020, media outlets reported instances of xenophobia towards foreigners,[37] although according to The Globe and Mail on 10 April, Chinese officials denied the existence of any such discrimination within China.[38] It has been attributed to fears of a second wave of the coronavirus, although the Chinese vice-foreign minister noted that ninety percent of imported COVID-19 cases were PRC nationals returning from overseas.[39][40] According to The Telegraph, foreigners are being barred from hotels, supermarkets, and restaurants, while others have had their visas cancelled and reentry into China barred.[41] The Guardian reported on 29 March of foreigners being shouted at by local residents, avoided in public places, and sometimes scolded as \"foreign trash\".[42] Shanghaiist has referenced stories of foreigner misbehaviour circulating on the Chinese internet as playing a role in the increased xenophobia.[43] A comic posted on Weibo depicts people in hazmat suits disinfecting foreigners and throwing them in waste bins.[44]\nIn April 2020, several reports emerged in Guangzhou of African nationals being evicted from their homes by local police and told to leave, with no place to sleep, amidst some recent Chinese news articles negatively reporting on Nigerians in the city.[45][46] The reports of discrimination created controversy in Africa damaging Sino-African relations,[47][48][49] and sparked a diplomatic crisis, with African governments and diplomats speaking out against the incidents in Guangzhou.[50] The Nigerian legislator Oloye Akin Alabi posted a video of his confronting the PRC's ambassador Zhou Pingjian over the alleged mistreatment of Nigerians in the city. The governments of Ghana, Kenya, and Uganda have also asked for explanations from the PRC government, and the African Union Commission invited the PRC ambassador to the African Union to discuss the mistreatment allegations.[51] The African ambassadors summarised the complaints in an official protest letter demanding the cessation of reported ejection from hotels or apartments, forced testing and quarantine, the seizure of passports, and threats of visa revocation, arrest or deportation of Africans particularly in the Guangdong province.[52] In response, Chinese authorities issued measures discouraging Guangzhou businesses and rental houses from refusing people based on race or nationality and encouraged foreigners to report discrimination to a 24-hour hotline.[53][54] Some locals coordinated food donations and listed available hotels online to African residents.[55]\nChina initially placed land mines in selected regions along its border with Myanmar, which were later replaced by a barbed wire fence along 1000 km of the Myanmese border, for the stated goal of reducing cross-border COVID-19 infections. Other government sources suggested that pandemic restrictions were secondary to a desire to block the transmission of foreign ideas across the once-porous border region, citing a desire to specifically restrict the flow of Christianity and Buddhism into China.[56]\nMore than a hundred restaurants in Hong Kong have turned away customers from mainland China, with one restaurant demanding that a customer produce a Hong Kong identity card to prove they were not from the mainland.[57] Tenno Ramen, a Japanese noodle restaurant in Hung Hom, refused to serve mainland Chinese customers. The restaurant said on Facebook, \"We want to live longer. We want to safeguard local customers. Please excuse us.\"[58] Another example is Kwong Wing Catering, a pro-2019–20 Hong Kong protests restaurant chain, which announced on Facebook on 28 January 2020 that it would serve only English- or Cantonese-speaking customers (no Mandarin-speakers customers allowed) since the government did not implement a border closure against mainland China. However, Mandarin is also the common tongue in Taiwan, so the said Facebook post was then updated a day later to clarify that they welcome Taiwanese customers.[59][60]\nMany protesters in Hong Kong have reportedly insisted on calling COVID-19 the \"Chinese Virus\" or \"Chinese coronavirus\".[61]\nThe Foreign Policy reported that \"On social media, Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram posts encourage people to stay away from places where Chinese citizens or Chinese-heritage Indonesians work and live. ... Major media outlets are also complicit in spreading anti-Chinese conspiracies.\"[62] Several Indonesian Muslims online have also linked the virus with China's mistreatment of Uighur Muslims, and that it is \"an azab (punishment) from Allah\".[63]\nA demonstration was staged outside a hotel in Bukittinggi, rejecting the visit of tourists from Southern China who stayed there amid fear of coronavirus. The demonstrators demanded that the tourists be isolated in an airport, and displayed distrust over screening tools in airports. It ended after police guaranteed that the tourists would stay in the hotel up to the following day, when the tourists depart from the city.[64][65]\nIn a press release, the embassy of Japan in Indonesia said incidents of discrimination and harassment toward Japanese people had increased in the midst of the pandemic, and announced they had set up a help center to assist Japanese residents dealing with these incidents.[66] In general, there have been reports of widespread anti-Japanese discrimination and harassment in the country, with hotels, stores, restaurants, taxi services and more refusing Japanese customers, and many Japanese people were no longer allowed in meetings and conferences. The embassy of Japan has also received at least a dozen reports of harassment toward Japanese people in just a few days.[67][68] The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Japan) said anti-Japanese discrimination was on the increase in the country.[69]\nPeople from Northeastern India have reportedly faced increased discrimination and harassment due to their \"Chinese\" appearance.[70] Northeast Indian students in Kirori Mal College, Delhi, have filed a complaint to college authorities about harassment in the hands of other students over the fears of coronavirus.[71] Eight students from Northeast India at the Tata Institute of Social Sciences in Mumbai also alleged that they were subjected to racism and harassment.[72]\nA survey by The Takshashila Institution found that 52.8% of Indian respondents felt terms such as \"Chinese Virus\" and \"Made in China Pandemic\" were not racist or stigmatising to the country.[73] The Bharatiya Janata Party's State unit president in West Bengal Dilip Ghosh said the Chinese had \"destroyed nature\" and \"that's why the God took revenge against them.\" The remarks were later condemned by the Chinese consulate in Kolkata, calling them \"erroneous\".[74]\nIn March 2020, foreigners from Europe, US and Israel started facing xenophobia and discrimination, including evictions from rented homes.[75]\nMuslim gatherings organised by the Tablighi Jamaat has resulted in large increased of cases in India,[76] which has triggered Islamophobic reactions and increased communal tension.[77][78] Islamophobic hashtags began circulating shortly after the news broke in late March,[79] and a wave of anti-Muslim violence was reported in April.[80] In Jharkhand, hospitals refusing to treat Muslim patients because coronavirus-related Islamophobia have led to the deaths of at least two newborn babies.[81]\nThere have been a few reports of increased anti-Christian violence and discrimination amidst the coronavirus lockdown.[82][83][84]\nThe Iranian government has blamed the country's outbreak on the \"Zionists\". The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) of Iran has claimed that Israel released the virus as a form of biological warfare. These claims were seen by some Jewish organisations, including the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), as being antisemitic.[85]\nAccording to the Japan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Japanese people have been denied entry to restaurants and experienced increased abuse since the pandemic.[86]\nMore than 1,000 South Korean tourists were instructed to avoid public places and remain in isolation in their hotels.[87] The Israeli military announced its intention to quarantine some 200 South Korean nationals to a military base.[88] Many of the remaining South Koreans were rejected by hotels and were forced to spend nights at Ben Gurion Airport.[89] An Israeli newspaper subsequently published a Korean complaint that \"Israel is Treating [Korean and other Asian] Tourists Like Coronavirus\".[90] Public health expert Dr. Hagai Levine said Israeli politicians may be overreaching to impress voters.[91]\nOn 14 March 2020, an Indian man from the Bnei Menashe community was attacked and beaten by several unidentified individuals in Tiberias who called him \"Chinese\" and \"Corona\".[92] The man was hospitalized at the Baruch Padeh Medical Center in Tiberias.[92]\nIn Japan, the hashtag #ChineseDontComeToJapan had been trending on Twitter;[93] furthermore, on Twitter, Japanese people have called Chinese tourists \"dirty\", \"insensitive\", and \"bioterrorists\".[94]\nA server at a restaurant in Ito, a Japanese city on the Izu Peninsula south of Tokyo, was recorded shouting at a tourist \"China! Out!\" A Chinese woman, who was the target of the outburst, immediately left the restaurant.[95]\nA confectionery shop in Hakone, Kanagawa Prefecture put up a sign saying \"No Chinese allowed!\" prompting Chinese citizens to boycott the store.[96]\nAccording to an Ipsos MORI poll conducted in February 2020, 28% of Japanese respondents said they would consider avoiding people of Chinese origin in the future to protect themselves from coronavirus.[97]\nUeno Sanji, a ramen restaurant in Tokyo has banned foreigners from dining there, with the owner claiming that he is doing so to protect his family, employees and regular customers.[98]\nOnoda Kimi [ja], a Liberal Democratic Party Upper House member in Okayama Prefecture, tweet via Twitter about financial support by Government of Japan that only the people who has rights to get financial support is adult with Japanese citizenship even others paid tax in Japan.[99] Because of the tweet she sent, people who interprets as racism launched a signature campaign to demand Onoda's resignation from the Diet in Change.org.[99]\nIn March 2020, a Korean working in Jordan since 2014 reported to the police that he was beaten and mocked due to his Asian appearance.[100] In another incident, a Jordanian who has a Korean mother was refused to take a taxi, for the same reason.[101]\nAccording to Japan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, there have been incidents of Japanese people in Jordan being chased by locals since the pandemic started.[86]\nIn February 2020, a conflict broke out between ethnic Kazakhs and Chinese Muslims. According to The Diplomat, \"In the hours following the incident, fake news about 'ruthless pogroms in Kazakhstan around the spreading of coronavirus' circulated around social media, fueling hysteria in other parts of the country.\"[102][103]\nTo address the deficit in the capacity at Kuwaiti hospitals to help in the COVID-19 outbreak, Kuwaiti actress Hayat Al-Fahad called for the deportation of migrant workers or to \"throw them in the desert\".[104] Her comments generated outrage on social media in Kuwait.[104]\nA petition in Malaysia calling for citizens from China to be banned from entering the country claimed that the \"new virus is widely spread throughout the world because of their unhygienic lifestyle\".[105] The petition was reportedly signed by just over 250,000 people within a week.[106]\nIslamophobia also occurs since March when social media users insult groups of Tabligh people as the cluster related to Sri Petaling Tabligh gathering cause it to experiencing sudden jump in number of cases in Malaysia.[107]\nAccording to Human Rights Watch and the Asia Pacific Refugee Rights Network, more than 700 foreign migrant workers and refugees including stateless Rohingya refugees have been detained by Malaysian police during the coronavirus pandemic.[108] Police have claimed that the arrests were intended to prevent undocumented migrants from traveling to other areas as part of lockdown movement restrictions.[109] In response to the arrests, the United Nations in Malaysia's Head of Communications and Advocacy, Ahmad Hafiz Osman, to avoid detaining refugees and not to hinder them from seeking medical treatment. The Home Affairs Minister Hamzah Zainuddin had earlier described the Rohingya as \"illegal immigrants\", who \"have no status, right and basis to present any demands to the government\".[110][109]\nIn addition, there have been incidents of xenophobia against Rohingya refugees in Malaysia, such as Malaysian politicians and locals expressing violent hate speech online,[111][112] accusing the Rohingya of committing crimes and dominating parts of the capital Kuala Lumpur. Names and photos of activists have been circulated on social media, and there have been several online petitions calling for the deportation of Rohingya on Change.org. This surge in hostility has been fueled by negative perceptions about Rohingya refugees and inflammatory news stories on social media.[109][113] According to The Star newspaper, there were also reports of Rohingya individuals making racially-tinged and provocative comments in social media videos targeting the Malay ethnicity community, which have strained relations between the two ethnic communities.[114] Rohingya community spokespersons have said the community is living in state of fear while the NGOs Mercy Malaysia and the Malaysian Relief Agency urged the public to show empathy and mercy towards the refugees during Ramadan.[113] On 11 May 83, human rights and civil society organisations including Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International, Article 19, and the International Committee of Jurists called on Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin to address online hate speech and violent threats against Rohingya refugees.[115]\nOn 21 June, Malaysian human rights NGO Aliran raised concerns about the living and working conditions of foreign migrant workers, many of whom had become infected with COVID-19. Aliran also criticised \"inflammatory\" media coverage for fueling xenophobia and hostility against migrant workers.[116]\nOn 25 June, the Kuala Lumpur City Hall restricted refugees' access to the city's wholesale market, allowing them entry only if they possessed valid permits and were accompanied by Malaysians. The City Hall does not recognise identity cards issued by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. This ruling was criticised by Yemen Refugee Union representative Dr Mohammed Al Radhi and Alliance of Chin Refugees coordinator James Bawi Thang Bik as discriminatory and inhumane towards refugee communities.[117]\nOn 27 June, Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin said Malaysia could not accommodate more Rohingya refugees due to a struggling economy and dwindling resources. Malaysia does not recognise their refugee status and has turned away incoming boats and detained hundreds of refugees. The Prime Minister also called upon the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to speed up the resettlement of Rohingya refugees in third party countries.[118][119]\nIn early July 2020, an Al Jazeera documentary titled \"Locked Up in Malaysia's Lockdown\" alleged that illegal migrants and foreign workers had subjected to racism and mistreatment by Malaysian authorities during the country's lockdown. The Malaysian Government criticised the documentary as \"misleading\" and \"inaccurate\", with Senior Minister Ismail Sabri Yaakob demanding an apology from the news network. The Royal Malaysian Police have launched an investigation into the documentary while the Immigration Department of Malaysia have sought to question a Bangladeshi migrant interviewed in the documentary.[120][121][122] In response, several civil society organisations including the Centre for Independent Journalism issued a statement calling on the Malaysian Government to cease intimidating media and to protect the rights of migrant workers.[123] The Bangladeshi migrant, who was identified as Mohammad Rayhan Kaybir, was subsequently deported to Bangladesh on 22 August.[124]\nOn 1 March 2020, a Palestinian mother with her daughter chanted \"corona, corona\" to the two Japanese women who were in Ramallah for non-governmental aid mission.[125][126] The mother then attacked and pulled the hair of one of the Japanese women who attempted to record the incident.[127] According to the Embassy of Japan, there have been at least another ten reports of anti-Japanese incidents related to the pandemic, as of early March.[86]\nVarious Filipino-Chinese advocacy groups have warned that racism against the Chinese community has risen after the outbreak has started.[128] The Federation of Filipino Chinese Chambers of Commerce and Industry, Inc and the Trade Union of Congress of the Philippines have condemned anti-Chinese propaganda with links to the virus.[128] Adamson University, a prominent Catholic school in Manila, received online backlash for ordering all its Chinese students to quarantine themselves amid the new coronavirus outbreak.[129] A crematorium refused to handle the corpse of a Chinese national who died from the virus.[130]\nPresident Rodrigo Duterte has made appeals to the public to stop discriminating against anyone who merely happens to be of Chinese ancestry.[131]\nImages of a South Asian migrant worker who was dressed as a human hand sanitiser while wearing a face mask for Saudi Aramco went viral online and sparked global outrage and was cited as another example of \"coronavirus racism\".[132][133] The company later apologised for the incident.[134]\nAn online petition urging the government of Singapore to ban Chinese nationals and travellers from China from entering the island country was signed by 125,000 people.[135]\nThe Ministry of Home Affairs has ordered an investigation against an Islamic teacher, Abdul Halim bin Abdul Karim, after he had posted on Facebook that the coronavirus pandemic was \"a retribution by Allah against the Chinese for their oppressive treatment of Muslim Uighurs in Xinjiang\". In a separate post, Abdul Halim claimed that Chinese people do not wash properly after defecating and were not as hygienic as Muslims, causing the virus to spread. Home Affairs and Law Minister K. Shanmugam slammed the comments as \"silly\", \"xenophobic\" and \"thoroughly racist\" and is \"quite unacceptable from anyone, let alone someone who is supposed to be a religious teacher\".[136] The Islamic Religious Council of Singapore said it is aware of the post, which \"expresses views that do not represent the Muslim community\" and was investigating the matter.[137] In response, Abdul Halim said his Facebook post, written in Malay, was not intended to be racist and did not target \"any particular race\".[138]\nDue to the Indian variant, a 55-year-old Singaporean-Indian female was being attacked for not properly wearing a mask. This has been condemned by several local politicians including Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong.[139] Xenophobic sentiments toward Indian immigrants in the country reportedly increased as of May 2021,[140] with Minister of Law K. Shanmugam condemning a minority of Singaporeans online for describing Indians as \"cockroaches\" and \"rapists\".[141]\nMore than 760,000 South Korean citizens have signed a petition lobbying the government to ban Chinese tourists from entering the country.[142][143] The Daegu Lantern Festival posted a notice in English that no foreigners are allowed to visit their festival.[144]\nIn February 2020, an entrance to a South Korean restaurant in downtown Seoul reportedly had a sign in red Chinese characters stating: \"No Chinese Allowed\".[145] \"No Chinese\" signs have been cropping up, and some businesses are banning all foreigners.[146]\nA group of Singaporean Chinese tourists were reportedly denied permission to climb the tourist attraction Ella Rock due to their appearance.[147]\nA restaurant in Chiang Mai displayed a sign which read, \"We apologize we are not accepting CHINESE customers. Thank you.\" after a customer left the restaurant upon noticing a group of Chinese people inside. The police demanded that the sign be taken down, but suggested that it could be rewritten in Chinese as \"We ran out of food\".[148] A similar sign was seen outside a restaurant in Ao Sane Beach in Phuket.[149]\nGraffiti artist Headache Stencil reportedly tweeted, \"Hey Chink! Please go back to ur shit-eating country. Our government need ur money to keep their power but you all not welcome for us now. #notwelcometothailand #backtourchinklandpls\".[148]\nHealth minister Anutin Charnvirakul made negative comments about \"dirty\" Westerners, saying they \"never shower\" and are more likely to spread the virus than Asians.[150][151] He later apologised for the comments.[152]\nIn December 2020, Thai Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha said illegal immigration was behind a new wave of COVID-19 infection in the country. Migrant workers from neighboring Myanmar bore the brunt of the blame, including incendiary social media posts advocating violence, such as \"wherever you see Myanmar people, shoot them down,\" and refusal of service across Thai society, with Burmese citizens refused access to buses, motorcycle taxis, and offices. COVID-19 xenophobia also led to a reawakening of anger related to the 18th century destruction by Burmese forces of Ayutthaya, capital of what was then known as Siam, now Thailand. The head of Thailand's COVID-19 taskforce pleaded for tolerance in a televised broadcast, appealing to common religious values: \"Today they are our family ... Both Myanmar and Thai people are Buddhists.\"[153] In January 2021, however, 19 migrants from Myanmar, all Rohingya Muslims, were arrested at a crowded house near Don Mueang International Airport in Bangkok. Authorities claimed that seven of the allegedly unauthorized migrants had tested positive for the coronavirus.[154]\nWhile in 2019, a poll estimated that 83.2% of Turks wanted all Syrian refugees returned, the pandemic caused a further rise of xenophobia and anti-refugee sentiment in Turkey.[155] A couple of religious news outlets have reported a spike in attacks on Turkish churches, with some scapegoating Christians for the coronavirus crisis in Turkey.[156][157]\nFollowing comments made by Kuwaiti actress Hayat Al-Fahad about the deportation of migrant workers to the desert or to their countries of origin due to COVID-19,[104] Emirati poet Tariq Al-Mehyas clarified Al-Fahad's comments by stating \"When we say \"migrants\" we mean Asians [not Arabs]\".[158] He went on to say that Arab workers from countries such as Egypt and Sudan were better than Asian (Indian and Bengali) workers and said Asians in the Gulf are never treated equally with Arabs.[158] When his comments generated widespread outrage in the UAE, he said he was not racist because he had an Asian maid.[159][160] Al-Mehyas was later arrested by Emirati authorities for inciting hatred.[159]\nAsia Times reported that \"A number of Vietnamese hotels and guesthouses have reportedly hung signs on their doors saying Chinese guests are not welcome, while many Vietnamese have gone online to demand the closure of all border crossings with China.\"[161] Signs suggesting that Chinese customers are not accepted were seen in front of a shop in Phu Quoc and a restaurant in Da Nang.[162]\nAnger was also reported due to the increasing number of the infected cases coming from the Muslim community returning from Malaysia following their attendance of the Tablighi Jamaat festival in Sri Petaling mosque, and two to three patients did not obey the self-quarantine law in Vietnam and still attended Islamic events in Ho Chi Minh City, leading to fury and demands to imprison the Muslim population, even among Vietnamese celebrities.[163]\nThere have been reports by Asian people of increased racism in Belgium due to the pandemic.[164]\nA Belgian woman of Chinese origin was called \"coronavirus\", threatened, and spat on by five youths in Schaerbeek.[165]\nA photograph depicting high school students in Chinese costumes while holding a sign that said \"Corona Time\" was posted on the official Facebook and Instagram of Sint-Paulusschool Campus College Waregem, a secondary school, in March 2020.[166][167][168] One of the students added latex gloves and a medical mask to his attire in reference to the outbreak,[166][168] while another student stretched her eyes in a racist gesture.[166][167] The photograph was removed after online backlash.[166][167] The school released a statement, claiming that the school team and the last-grade students had no intention to be condescending or offensive.[167]\nIn Brussels, a 22-year-old man punched a 24-year-old Asian man and accused him of being \"the cause\" of coronavirus in Belgium.[169]\nOn 15 February 2020, during a Croatian Table Tennis Superleague match which was played in Dubrovnik between the local team Libertas Marinkolora and guest team STK Starr from Varaždin, a number of insulting comments were posted on the official Libertas Marinkolora Facebook page towards a Croatian player of Chinese origin, Tan Ruiwu of STK Starr which referenced the coronavirus. This included a comment by the manager of Libertas Marinkolor Marko Habijanec in which he instructed one of his players (who was facing Tan in the next match) to \"Beat this virus\". The comments were subsequently deleted.[170] Libertas Marinkolor eventually issued an apology and condemnation of the incident.[171]\nIn January 2020, Jyllands-Posten received international attention when it published a cartoon depicting the Chinese flag with yellow virus-like figures instead of the usual yellow stars.

However, Leão expressed concern that anti-Asian sentiment will increase in Brazil as well, because of how Brazil's president Jair Bolsonaro tried to use the pandemic as an opportunity to attack China, similar to Donald Trump. In early 2020, Bolsonaro reportedly became convinced that COVID-19 was \"part of a Chinese government scheme to expand its global power\".\nAccording to Leão, there have already been reports of Brazilians of Asian descent suffering from pandemic-related harassment, for example, being told to \"go back to their country\" or being accused of \"spreading the virus\".

One Chinese Brazilian in particular was told \"Put the fucking mask on, you piece of shit. These pests come to our country to kill us. Go back to your country, you animal\" when we tried to take off his mask to drink water at a clinic in Rio de Janeiro at the end of 2020.[514]\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau condemned racism against Chinese Canadians while attending a Lunar New Year festival in Toronto on 29 January 2020.[515] Likewise, John Tory, the Mayor of Toronto, denounced xenophobia toward Chinese Canadians, amid reports of increasing stigma facing that community.[516][517]\nOn 30 January 2020, the World Health Organization's Emergency Committee issued a statement advising all countries to be mindful of the \"principles of Article 3 of the IHR (the International Health Regulations)\", which the WHO says is a caution against \"actions that promote stigma or discrimination\", when conducting national response measures to the outbreak.[518]\nIn response to the heightened outbreak of the virus in Italy, which caused the Chinese community to shut down businesses due to racist attacks, President Sergio Mattarella made a surprise visit on 6 February 2020 to a primary school in Rome where nearly half the pupils are Chinese, saying \"Friendship and peace are fundamental and you know it.\"[519][520]\nAn online petition entitled We zijn geen virussen!
