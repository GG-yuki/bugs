            "report_content": "By Lucy Rodgers and Dominic BaileyBBC News\nBuilding a \"big, beautiful wall\" between the US and Mexico was the signature promise of President Donald Trump's 2016 election campaign. A concrete barrier, he said, would serve to stop what he described as a flow of illegal immigrants and drugs over the border.\nBut what actually happened to the wall? How much of it has been built? And how effective has it been?\nAny calculation of the miles of new wall constructed by Mr Trump and his administration depends very much on the definition of the words \"new\" and \"wall\".\nBefore he took office, there were 654 miles (just over 1,000km) of barrier along the southern border - made up of 354 miles of barricades to stop pedestrians and 300 miles of anti-vehicle fencing.\nNow, according to US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) in its 6 October status report, the southern border has 669 miles of \"primary barrier\" - the first structure people heading from Mexico to the US will encounter - and 65 miles of \"secondary barrier\" - which usually runs behind the primary structure as a further obstacle.\nThis means that in areas where no barricades existed before, they have built 15 miles of new, primary barrier or \"border wall system\", as it is called by CBP.\nââAbout a further 350 miles of barrier has been built, according to CBP, made up of replacement structures and some new secondary barrier.\nMore is planned, too, with 378 miles of new and replacement barrier either under construction or in the \"pre-construction phase\". Less than half of this will be in locations where no barriers currently exist, according to CBP.\nHowever, Mr Trump himself doesn't make a distinction between these new stretches of barrier and replacement structures, regarding both as new wall.\nThis is because, he says, replacements involve \"complete demolition and rebuilding of old and worthless barriers\".\nWhen the Military rips down an old & badly broken Border Wall in an important location, & replaces it with a brand new 30 ft. high Steel & Concrete Wall, Nancy Pelosi says we are not building a Wall. Wrong, and it is going up fast. Brandon Judd just gave us great marks! @FoxNews\nAnd he regards the progress made so far as a success.\n\"My administration has done more than any administration in history to secure our southern border,\" Mr Trump said in June during a visit to the wall.\nBut what Mr Trump has actually built is far from what he promised at the start of his 2016 election campaign, when he pledged to build a concrete wall along the border's entire 2,000-mile length.\nHe later clarified that it would cover only half of that. And by the time of his State of the Union address in February this year, his pledge had been reduced to \"substantially more than 500 miles\" by January 2021.\nMr Trump is still short of that target - even if you include all the new, replacement and secondary barriers erected so far.\nYet how much more will be built is uncertain, with Democratic rival presidential candidate Joe Biden saying that, while he would not tear down the barrier Mr Trump has built, he would not expand it further.\nAs well as scaling back his ambitions for the length of the border barrier, Mr Trump has also changed his view of what constitutes a wall.\nThroughout his 2016 election campaign, when he described it, he talked about concrete.\nBut once elected, he began referring to a barrier made of steel, which would enable border agents to see through it.\nAnd what has been built so far is mostly such steel fencing.\nSpecifically, much of the current wave of construction is 18-30ft (5.4-9m) reinforced bollard fencing, according to a report by the non-partisan Congressional Research Service.\n\"It poses a formidable barrier, but it is not the high, thick masonry structure that most dictionaries term a 'wall',\" the report states.\nHowever, the report adds that while the new barriers may not be made of concrete and in many cases replace existing structures, they do pose \"a new obstacle that changes the calculus of those attempting to cross the border between ports of entry\".\nHaving said that, although Mr Trump's barriers are not themselves made of concrete, they have been constructed using a significant amount of it, according to CBP.\nSome 774,000 cubic yards (592,000 cubic metres) of concrete have been used in construction so far, alongside 539,000 tonnes of steel.\nDespite Mr Trump's pledge on the campaign trail in 2016 to get Mexico to pay for the wall, it is the US government that has spent billions of dollars to expand and reconstruct it.\nJust over $5bn (Â£3.9bn) in funding has come via traditional means through the CBP, but Mr Trump has also ordered almost $10bn in Department of Defense (DoD) funding to be diverted - a move that has sparked legal action.\nBack in 2019, after his request for a further $5.7bn for the wall was rejected and Congress allotted only $1.4bn, Mr Trump declared border control a national emergency and used powers under the National Emergencies Act to move cash from DoD budgets.\nSome $6.3bn of counter-drugs funding and Â£3.6bn of military construction funding has so far been diverted to the wall project, according to the CBP.\nBut Mr Trump's decision to bypass Congress in this way has triggered a number of legal challenges - one from a number of environmental groups, represented by the American Civil Liberties Union, along with the states of California and New Mexico.\nTwo lower US courts have ruled in favour of these groups, concluding that the diversion of an amount of $2.5bn from DoD to construct barriers in California, New Mexico and Arizona was unlawful.\nHowever, the Supreme Court - the highest federal court in the US - has allowed barrier construction using the funds to continue pending the appeals process. It will hear a challenge by President Trump's administration against the lower courts' decision next year.\nMeanwhile, Democrats in the House of Representatives have also launched separate legal action.\nMr Trump made reducing illegal immigration a top priority of his administration and it has been a key part of his re-election campaign.\nThe latest figures suggest the number of migrants apprehended at the southern border this year have fallen after doubling between 2018 and 2019.\nIn particular, the number of children and those travelling in family groups apprehended at the border has dropped significantly in the 12 months to October, compared with the previous year.\nHow much this fall in numbers is down to the new barriers is unclear, though, and immigration experts say the drop is likely to be the result of the deterrent effect of a whole raft of anti-immigration measures introduced by Mr Trump's administration rather than the barrier alone.\nThose fleeing violence or persecution to the US have found asylum rules tightened, been forced to wait in camps for long periods as their cases are determined and come up against new limits on the number of refugees accepted into the country.\nThe administration has also adopted emergency procedures during the coronavirus pandemic that allow agents to expel those crossing the border back to Mexico, bypassing normal immigration and asylum proceedings.\n\"Any effect that the physical wall has had in reducing unauthorised migration has paled in comparison to the administration's bureaucratic wall,\" says Sarah Pierce, US immigration policy analyst at the independent Migration Policy Institute.\nA series of \"interlocking policies\" have \"significantly reduced unauthorised arrivals\", she told the BBC.\nBut although figures for detentions at the border are likely to have dropped for the year as a whole compared with 2019, monthly figures have been rising since the spring and reached a 13-month high in September.\nThis is driven partly by single adults from Mexico who have been trying to enter the US repeatedly, according to CBP figures. Data shows the \"recidivism rate\" - the number of repeat crossers - has risen by 37% since the end of March.\nMark Morgan, CBP's acting commissioner, has suggested worsening economic conditions due to the coronavirus pandemic in Mexico and further afield could be to blame.\nThousands who have made the journey to the southern US border have found refuge in temporary border communities - often in shanty towns with little infrastructure or resources and vulnerable to pressure from violent organised-crime gangs.\nAccording to Human Rights Watch, these migrants are under threat from criminal organisations which kidnap them on the assumption that they have relatives in the US who could be extorted for money.\nIn the town of Matamoros, across the border from Brownsville, Texas, hundreds of people set up one such camp in 2018 near the entry point, in the scrubland on the banks of the Rio Grande.\nBy the start of this year, the camp had around 3,500 people living in tents - men, women, and children from across Central and South America and beyond. Another 10,000 asylum seekers are thought to be living elsewhere in the city.\nCharities such as the World Food Kitchen, the Dignity Village collective and Global Response Management (GRM) provide food, tents, clothing and medical care to those living in the camp, where around 50% of residents are under the age of 15.\nBut Andrea Leiner, director of strategic planning for GRM, says coronavirus and July's Hurricane Hanna have had dire consequences.\nCoronavirus restrictions have meant the border has been closed for all but essential travel and immigration hearings have been postponed.\nHurricane Hanna not only brought floods to the camp but also caused an infestation of rats, snakes and mosquitoes, forcing many residents to flee.\nMs Leiner says the repeated blows of plague, famine, and hurricane, on top of the legal restrictions, have drained people of hope.\n\"These people have nowhere to go. They can't go home - they will be killed if they go home - and they can't get into the US, so they are stuck in this purgatory right now and we don't see that ending any time soon,\" she says.\nMr Trump has claimed in the past that 90% of heroin in the US comes across the southern border and that a wall would help the fight against drugs.\nHowever strengthening and extending the border barrier is unlikely to do much to reduce illegal drugs - such as heroin, cocaine and methamphetamine - because most come through established border checkpoints, known as ports of entry.\nWhile the majority of the heroin in the US does come from Mexico, the Drug Enforcement Administration says most of it is hidden in privately owned vehicles or transporter lorries, mixed with other goods, and smuggled through legal entry points.\nCBP figures for drugs - excluding marijuana - seized on the southern border also show most come through ports of entry, although a report by the Congressional Research Service does state that border barriers can serve to push people to cross in places where they are more likely to be \"detected, intercepted, and detained\".\nRodney Scott, chief of the US Border Patrol, agrees - and gives the example of San Diego, where he says cartel lorries used to drive across the border \"three or four at a time on an almost daily basis, with high-speed pursuits throughout town\".\n\"Those stopped immediately with the border wall system, \" he says. \"It does not mean cartels will stop smuggling drugs - now we're going to deal with tunnels and other aspects - but it pushed that threat, the daily life-and-death threat for kids waiting for a school bus near the border, out of those areas.\"\nSmugglers also appear increasingly to be using boats to try to land drugs on the beaches of southern California - with the numbers intercepted by CBP's air and marine operations jumping 82% last year.\nMarijuana is the most trafficked drug, with more than 227 tonnes seized on the southern border this year. It is also the drug most likely to be smuggled in areas away from the border checkpoints.\nTraffickers regularly use underground tunnels to smuggle tonnes of marijuana, mainly in the California and Arizona stretches of the border.\nDesign by Zoe Bartholomew and Gerry Fletcher\nDid Trump stop more people coming to the US?\nHow are Trump and Biden doing in the polls?\nA really simple guide to the US election\nHas Trump delivered on his promises?\nÂ© 2021 BBC.

            "report_content": "By Christopher GilesBBC Reality Check\nPresident Donald Trump is visiting the southern border in Texas to claim success in the construction of a border fence with Mexico.\nThe White House said his visit would \"mark the completion of more than 400 miles of border wall - a promise made, promise kept\".\nSo how much of the border wall has Mr Trump managed to build during his term in office?\nVarious types of fencing totalling 654 miles (just over 1,000 km) were already in place before Mr Trump became president in 2017.\nThese ran through the states of California, Arizona, New Mexico and Texas.\nThe Trump administration say they've completed more than 400 miles of border wall since then.\nIt's 452 miles (727 km) in total, according to the latest US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) information (4 January 2021).\nHowever, only 80 miles of new barriers have been built where there were none before - that includes 47 miles of primary wall, and 33 miles of secondary wall built to reinforce the initial barrier.\nThe vast majority of the 452 miles is replacing existing structures at the border that had been built by previous US administrations.\nPresident Trump has argued that this should be regarded as new wall, because it's replacing what he called \"old and worthless barriers.\"\nIn 2016, President Trump repeatedly claimed Mexico would pay for the wall. This didn't happen.\nThe US government has paid for the wall, and there've been arguments over how to fund it between the Trump administration and Congress.\nIn January 2018, Mr Trump asked Congress to pay $18bn (Â£13.6bn) over the next decade for an initial phase of construction, but the bill ultimately failed.\nSome money was allocated by Congress in 2018 for projects at the border.\nHowever, in 2019 Mr Trump used national emergency powers to divert funds from the Department of Defense after Congress rejected more money for the wall.\nThere has been around $15bn spent for the construction of the barrier coming from various US government departments, including the Department of Homeland Security, and the Defense and Treasury Departments.\nIt was originally estimated a cross-border wall could cost anything from $12bn to $40bn.\nDespite this, in the run-up to the 3 November 2020 election, President Trump continued to say that \"Mexico is paying for it\".\nIn the past, he's implied that a new trade agreement (signed last year) involving Mexico and Canada would indirectly save the US money, which could be spent on the wall.\nHowever, it's not clear how exactly this would work.\nPresident Trump also pledged to reduce illegal movement across the border.\nThe number of people detained at the border increased significantly between 2018 and 2019, but dropped off in 2020.\n\"The decrease in apprehensions comes as the movement of migrants in the Americas and worldwide has slowed during the Covid-19 outbreak, with governments fully or partially closing their borders to stem its spread,\" according to Ana Gonzalez-Barrera, a senior researcher at Pew Research, a nonpartisan think tank based in Washington DC.\nPresident-elect Joe Biden has said that he will not continue further construction of the wall.\nHe said he would not build \"another foot\" and made clear he opposed taking funds from the Department of Defense.\nInstead, the Democratic president-elect plans to focus on using technology along the border to detect illegal activity.\nJoe Biden's official website says: \"Biden will direct federal resources to smart border enforcement efforts, like investments in improving screening infrastructure at our ports of entry.\"\nHowever, it is unclear what the new administration will do with contracts for wall construction which have already been awarded under Mr Trump - but are as yet not finished.\nRead more from Reality Check\nSend us your questions\nOmicron spreading at unprecedented rate - WHO\nMore than 100 trapped after fire in HK building\nBullied for being 'effeminate' in China\nA $10bn machine in search of the end of darkness\n'I spent my birthday trapped under tornado rubble'\nBullied for being 'effeminate' in China\nDavid Fuller: How police caught a killer.

            "report_content": "Advertisement\nSupported by\nA last-minute rush to build lasted through Donald J. Trump’s last day in office. The effort left odd, partially completed sections of a barrier whose fate President Biden must now determine.\nSend any friend a story\nAs a subscriber, you have 10 gift articles to give each month. Anyone can read what you share.\nBy Simon Romero and Zolan Kanno-Youngs\nSIERRA VISTA, Ariz. — The sweeping view of undefiled wilderness on the border with Mexico long rewarded hikers who completed the Arizona Trail, an 800-mile route winding through deserts, canyons and forests.\nThen something else came into focus a few weeks ago at the forbidding site in the Huachuca Mountains: a lonely segment of border wall, connected to nothing at all, in an area where migrants rarely even try to cross into the United States.\n“There it was, this unfinished piece of completely pointless wall, right in this magical place,” said Julia Sheehan, 31, a nurse and former Air Force mechanic who trekked to the site with three other military veterans who are hiking the Arizona Trail. “It’s one of the most senseless things I’ve ever seen.”\nThe quarter-mile fragment of wall is part of an array of new barrier segments along the border, some of them bizarre in appearance and of no apparent utility, that contractors rushed to build in the waning days of the Trump administration — well after President Biden made it clear that he would halt border wall construction.\nNow the incomplete border wall, already one of the costliest megaprojects in United States history, with an estimated eventual price tag of more than $15 billion, is igniting tensions again as critics urge Mr. Biden to tear down parts of the wall and Republican leaders call on him to finish it.\nThe latest controversy over the wall comes amid a significant increase in migration across the border that is prompting U.S. authorities to search for extra places to hold new arrivals, especially unaccompanied children and teenagers. More than 9,400 young migrants arrived along the border without parents in February, a nearly threefold increase over last year at the same time, creating a serious humanitarian challenge.\nThe Biden administration suspended construction on the border wall on Jan. 20, the president’s first day in office, announcing a 60-day period during which officials are determining how to proceed.\nDonald J. Trump made the wall a symbol of his administration’s efforts to slash immigration. While many stretches of the 1,954-mile border already had some low-level barriers built by previous administrations, the project was mired in controversy from the start.\nOnly a few miles were built in South Texas, the area most prone to illegal crossings. Instead, much of the construction, especially in the Trump administration’s closing days, has taken place in remote parts of Arizona where crossings in recent years have been relatively uncommon.\nU.S. Customs and Border Protection, the agency responsible for selecting border wall construction sites, contended in a statement last week that locations chosen for new border barriers are “areas of high illegal entry.”\n“Border barriers slow and stop illegal activity,” said Matthew Dyman, a C.B.P. spokesman.\nAlejandro Mayorkas, Mr. Biden’s homeland security secretary, has been directed to decide whether to “resume, modify, or terminate” projects when the 60-day suspension ends this month. But the last-minute construction efforts, with much of the rushed building activity taking place in the days between the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol by Trump loyalists and Mr. Biden’s inauguration on Jan. 20, have left a curious tableau for the new administration to evaluate.\nSome stretches of the border, especially on federal lands that are relatively flat, now have long, continuous segments of 30-foot high steel barriers that could endure in the desert for decades to come.\nBut in other areas, border-crossers can easily tiptoe around far-flung islands of wall, some of which look more like conceptual art pieces than imposing barriers to entry.\nThere are half-dynamited mountaintops where work crews put down their tools in January, leaving a heightened risk of rapid erosion and even dangerous landslides as the summer monsoon season approaches.\nIn some areas, colossal piles of unused steel bollards linger at deserted work sites, next to idled bulldozers and water-hauling trucks. In Arizona, ranchers are complaining that rough roads carved by work crews into hillsides near uncompleted segments of wall now serve as easy access points for smugglers and others seeking to enter the once-remote areas along the border.\n“Now there are so many access roads that it’s possible for someone to walk right up to places where the wall ends, and have someone just pick them up,” said Valer Clark, a conservationist who has bought and sought to preserve about 150,000 acres of land along the border in both the United States and Mexico.\nMs. Clark said a ranch manager recently quit after a break-in at his family’s home, the kind of crime that was rare in the area before the new roads appeared.\nAltogether, the Trump administration completed about 453 miles of border wall since 2017. Billions of dollars for the wall were diverted from funding originally appropriated to the Defense Department.\nMost of the construction involved upgrading smaller existing barriers. In places where no barriers previously existed, such as the rugged terrain where the Arizona Trail winds to its terminus, the Trump administration built a total of 47 miles of new primary wall.\nMatthew Nelson, the executive director of the Arizona Trail Association, wondered why the Kiewit Corporation, the Nebraska construction giant with the lucrative wall contract for the area, rushed to build a small piece of wall in January — in an area conservation activists were fighting to preserve — when it was likely that construction would be halted anyway once Mr. Biden took office. He questioned if it was an attempt to pressure the new administration into proceeding with additional construction at the site.\nMr. Nelson said the location of the trail in the Coronado National Memorial, a protected expanse managed by the National Park Service, was chosen because of its natural beauty and its location along a relatively safe section of the border where few migrants cross.\n“Why rush to put a quarter-mile wall in the middle of nowhere in an area that has never been identified as a high-profile border crossing?” Mr. Nelson asked.\nKiewit officials did not respond to a request for comment regarding the piece of wall the company built in January at the end of the Arizona Trail.\nC.B.P. declined to provide specific information about border crossings at the location.\nRodney S. Scott, the chief of the Border Patrol, conceded in November that constructing in South Texas, rather than Arizona, was a “higher priority for the U.S. Border Patrol.” But he said “we elected to go ahead and shift down to a lower priority because I could make a difference there and then.”\nThe centerpiece of Biden’s domestic agenda. The sprawling $2.2 trillion spending bill aims to battle climate change, expand health care and bolster the social safety net. Here’s a look at some key provisions and how they might affect you:\nChild care. The proposal would provide universal pre-K for all children ages 3 and 4 and subsidized child care for many families. The bill also extends an expanded tax credit for parents through 2022.\nPaid leave. The proposal would provide workers with four weeks of paid family and medical leave, which would allow the U.S. to exit the group of only six countries in the world without any national paid leave. However, this provision is likely to be dropped in the Senate.\nHealth care. The bill’s health provisions, which represent the biggest step toward universal coverage since the Affordable Care Act, would expand access for children, make insurance more affordable for working-age adults and improve Medicare benefits for disabled and older Americans.\nDrug prices. The plan includes a provision that would, for the first time, allow the government to negotiate prices for some prescription drugs covered by Medicare. ​​\nClimate change. The single largest piece of the bill is $555 billion for climate programs. The centerpiece of the climate spending is about $320 billion in tax incentives for producers and purchasers of wind, solar and nuclear power.\nTaxes. The plan calls for nearly $2 trillion in tax increases on corporations and the rich. The bill also raises the cap on how much residents — particularly in high-tax blue states — can deduct in state and local taxes, undoing the so-called SALT cap.\nThe area near the Arizona Trail was not the only place where there was a flurry of building activity in the closing days of the previous administration. Between Jan. 4 and Jan. 8 alone, Customs and Border Protection began construction on 12 additional miles of border wall, according to the agency’s disclosures.\nIn some places along the border, such as Guadalupe Canyon in southeast Arizona, dynamiting crews were blasting hillsides on Inauguration Day.\nEven before the latest construction, there had been anomalies, like an island of wall in the Texas border town of Los Indios, and some of them attracted the attention of federal overseers.\nA 34-month audit of border wall construction by the Department of Homeland Security’s Office of Inspector General last year identified significant problems, including in decisions on where wall segments would be built.\nCustoms and Border Protection “did not use a sound, well-documented methodology to identify and prioritize investments in areas along the border that would best benefit from physical barriers,” the auditors determined.\nThe Biden administration has not made clear precisely what plans it has for the wall. But in February, after temporarily suspending building activities, President Biden rescinded the national emergency that his predecessor used to justify advancing construction.\nDemocratic members of Congress from border states, including Veronica Escobar of Texas and Teresa Leger Fernández of New Mexico, wrote to Mr. Biden this month urging him to cancel all remaining construction contracts and divert remaining funds to removing portions of the wall in places with “particularly destructive environmental damage and destruction of sacred sites.”\nAt the same time, Republicans are positioning themselves around the gaps in the border wall, sometimes literally, in an effort to portray Mr. Biden as soft on immigration.\nSenator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, complained after a visit in February to the border in Arizona that a gap in the wall there was allowing migrants to illegally enter the country across an unprotected wash.\n“Nothing around here makes sense unless you plug this hole,” Mr. Graham said.\nEven with the halting of new construction, parts of the federal bureaucracy are slowly continuing forward with the land acquisition process, alarming some landowners who had hoped Mr. Biden would heed their fears about the prospect of living in the barrier’s shadows.\nRicky Garza, a staff lawyer for the Texas Civil Rights Project, said the federal government still has nearly 150 open lawsuits against landowners in South Texas to survey and seize property and potentially begin construction on the border wall or other measures that could be used to detect migrants.\nMr. Garza, who represents some landowners in the region, said Justice Department lawyers have responded to Mr. Biden’s suspension of wall construction by asking the courts to delay legal cases for 60 days.\nBut some landowners continue to face pressure from the federal government in court, he said. One of them is Melissa Cigarroa, who said the government is still seeking a “right of entry” to her ranch in Zapata County, Texas, where she has long raised Barbary sheep.\n“Why would they proceed with these cases if he already indicated he wasn’t going to build another foot and said he would withdraw?” Ms. Cigarroa said. “It felt like the government was working in bad faith.”\nSimon Romero reported from Sierra Vista, and Zolan Kanno-Youngs from Washington.\nAdvertisement",

            "report_content": "John Burnett\nCritics in Texas say President Biden is going against his promise to halt construction of the Trump border wall.\nARI SHAPIRO, HOST:\nPresident Biden has been criticized by people in both parties for his handling of the border. On the day he took office in January, he signed a proclamation that paused construction of Donald Trump's border wall. Since then, most of the barrier has been halted. But new construction has begun on 13 miles of border wall in Hidalgo County, Texas, to the dismay of some locals. NPR's John Burnett reports.\n(SOUNDBITE OF CONSTRUCTION EQUIPMENT RATTLING)\nJOHN BURNETT, BYLINE: Here along the twisting Rio Grande, just south of McAllen, crews began building a new border wall this summer, and it continues apace. Longtime anti-wall activist Scott Nicol thinks it's great the Biden administration halted construction elsewhere along the 2,000-mile border.\nSCOTT NICOL: They should stop building walls here, too. You know, people are losing their land for this wall. And the wall is completely useless both in terms of flood control and immigration enforcement.\nBURNETT: We're standing on a levee road one sweltering morning watching crews pour concrete into molds 18 feet tall. The wall will be topped with steel bollards six feet tall. They're now calling them guardrails. Customs and Border Protection says this is not a continuation of Trump's border wall. It's actually a levee wall to patch the original earthen levee that was damaged by Trump's wall contractors. But my recent visit to the construction sites seems to confirm what critics are saying. Excavators and bulldozers were tearing out undamaged levee that's only 10 years old.\nNICOL: They're basically using the excuse of levee repair as a loophole to continue building walls because the levees were all repaired in 2011 using American Recovery and Reinvestment Act money.\nBURNETT: That checks out. President Obama spent $19 million to build up the Hidalgo County levee to FEMA standards.\nEVERARDO VILLAREAL: I mean, we had a perfect levee. It actually did the work that it was supposed to do during one of our last hurricane events.\nBURNETT: That's County Commissioner Everardo Villareal, who represents this area. He believes the government's border levee wall is completely unnecessary. CBP said in a statement to NPR that the earthen levee provided inadequate flood protection, and the new levee wall will address life, safety and environmental requirements. In a June press release, though, the agency acknowledged that there was money left on the table that it had to spend. CBP is, quote, \"legally required\" to use money that Congress earmarked for Trump's border wall for its appropriated purpose. Again, Commissioner Villareal.\nVILLAREAL: Obviously, you know, the decision that was made to build this border wall wasn't our decision. Obviously, it created issues for a lot of our residents here in this area.\nBURNETT: One of those aggrieved residents is Rey Anzaldua, a 76-year-old former customs agent whose family owns a scenic campground along the Rio Grande.\nREY ANZALDUA: We don't need it. We have a levee. We don't need a wall. So it's a bunch of malarkey that they're saying that they need a wall to protect the citizens. It's not true.\nBURNETT: Earlier this year, a condemnation lawsuit against the family property prevailed, and the government seized six and a half acres of the intact levee for the massive new levee wall. It is one of dozens of land confiscation lawsuits that are still pending in federal court in South Texas. Anzaldua had thought if they could just hold out until Biden won the White House, he would cancel the project, and they'd be in the clear.\nANZALDUA: He said not one more for the wall, and no more land confiscations. As you can see, Biden didn't keep his word.\nBURNETT: CBP will not say how much the new border levee wall is costing. Congress originally set aside $330 million for this 13-mile section. That works out to a breathtaking 25 million a mile. Commissioner Villareal, a Democrat, shook his head. Hidalgo County has one of the highest poverty rates in the nation. Do we really need a $300 million concrete flood wall, he says, that doesn't make the county any safer? John Burnett, NPR News, McAllen, Texas.\nCopyright © 2021 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "claim": "Building a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border will take literally years.",
            "report_link": "https://www.azcentral.com/in-depth/news/local/arizona-environment/2021/04/15/arizona-mexico-border-calls-removing-wall-and-repairing-environmental-impacts/4589493001/",
            "report_content": "Along the southernmost edge of Arizona, where the San Pedro River once flowed freely over the border from its headwaters in Mexico, a 30-foot steel wall slices across the channel. The barrier resembles a fortress, with massive floodgates, a concrete bridge and light poles that tower over the riverbed.\nBefore the Trump administration broke ground on the new wall, the river and the shady forest along it had cut through the only opening in a stretch of 40 miles of fence. Now, environmentalists and others who live near the border fear for the animals that will hit an impenetrable barrier on their journeys north and south and they wonder what will happen the next time dangerous floods rush through.\nThe river, which provides habitat for a diverse array of wildlife, has emerged as a symbol of the ecological damage that conservationists say was inflicted when new segments of wall severed wilderness areas across the borderlands.\n“Just watching that progression over the last year and a half, it’s like watching a slow death,” said Myles Traphagen, a biologist and program manager with the conservation group Wildlands Network.\nTraphagen has been tracking the construction work for the past three years, watching as miles and miles of the landscape were reshaped.\nElsewhere along the border, animal tracks form a trail in the desert alongside a recently built stretch of the wall.\nGravel roads zigzag up the disfigured faces of mountainsides torn apart by explosives.\nGrasslands, deserts and wetlands bear the scars of equipment that carved up the landscape. Where trees and cactuses once stood, there are stretches of bare soil scraped by construction vehicles.\nA bulldozer sits parked on a road cut into a steep mountainside of Guadalupe Canyon, which was blasted to make way for the wall. A support beam props up the edge of the 30-foot steel wall while the last of the concrete dries.\nIn rolling hills near the border, where a well hummed for months pumping water for construction, a rocky gully now sits bone dry. The spring disappeared during one of the hottest, driest years on record, leaving a sandy streambed.\nThe lands were transformed during nearly four years of construction for a wall that former President Donald Trump vowed to build as a defense against illegal immigration. In flurries of work during the final months of his administration, new wall segments sprang up in some of the wildest areas of the borderlands.\nBy the end of 2020, the Trump administration had completed 452 miles of border wall, at an estimated cost of nearly $16 billion from U.S. taxpayers and diverted military funds. Half of that construction occurred in Arizona. When Trump left office in January, U.S. Customs and Border Protection said about 226 miles of new steel-bollard barrier had been built in the state.\nThe construction has cut through fragile ecosystems in some of North America’s hotspots of biodiversity, where animal species like bears and jaguars once roamed unimpeded. While the long-term effects on the environment are uncertain, conservationists say the barriers and water use have worsened conditions for habitats already threatened by the changing climate.\nNow that construction has stopped, President Joe Biden and his administration are left with the question of what to do next.\nEnvironmental activists and tribal leaders say some of the damage is permanent, from the blasted mountains to the millions of gallons of water that can’t be put back in the ground. But they believe other effects of the wall can be reversed and they want the Biden administration to go further than stopping construction.\nThey are urging the government to begin habitat restoration efforts and take down sections of wall that are blocking wildlife migration pathways so that animals can once again move freely. They argue that in strategic places, some of the damage can and should be undone and that it’s time to start healing these scars on the landscape where possible.\nThis push to remove some of the barriers faces resistance from Republican members of Congress who say they want to finish planned portions of the wall. But calls for removing certain segments of the wall have come from Democratic former Interior secretaries Bruce Babbitt and Sally Jewell.\n“These are really significant, important wildlife areas,” said Babbitt, who was also Arizona governor from 1978 to 1987. “And the idea that it all requires a 30-foot wall just makes no sense.”\nOn a recent afternoon, Traphagen walked along the border toward the San Pedro River, dwarfed by the newly built fencing that runs across the floodplain. His eyes were glued to his phone.\n“We want data for site-specific restoration, latitude and longitude of areas that are sensitive and in need of immediate restoration,” Traphagen said. He was testing an app he and other conservation advocates are using to map out coordinates for sections of wall that they hope the Biden administration will consider tearing down.\nThe San Pedro River is a haven for migratory birds and wildlife, providing food and water in the arid landscape. In the past, animals like mountain lions and javelina regularly crossed through this corridor, passing through Normandy-style vehicle barriers. Those barricades, which were barely visible from afar, were removed and replaced by steel fencing, which forms a dark partition, severing the view.\nThis new fencing, which now stretches from Coronado National Memorial to the New Mexico state line, is impassable for many species.\nTraphagen walked along the bridge and counted the floodgates — there are more than 50 on the west side of the river.\n“The first thing we need to do is open these gates,” he said.\nBeside a newly built stretch of wall in the San Bernardino Valley, a wide strip of cleared land cuts through grasslands, wetlands and thickets of mesquite trees. On the bare ground beside the wall, animal tracks have cut a trail that runs east and west along the Mexican side of the barrier.\nJosé Manuel Pérez Cantú manages land abutting the border on a cattle ranch where for years conservationists have worked to restore the ecosystem. He squatted and pointed to the tracks.\n“This is probably a javelina family, going west,” Pérez said.\n“We have seen a lot of tracks of wildlife trying to find a path to cross,” he said. “Wildlife is trying to find a way through, and they are not finding it.”\nPérez and his colleagues have been working to restore once-degraded lands at Cuenca los Ojos, a reserve of conservation-focused ranches, to prevent erosion and bring back native grasslands and flowing streams.\nThe efforts have shown success. But the sudden burst of wall construction has been a major setback, Pérez said. He described the new barrier as “an ecocide.”\nNow the wall blocks many animals from searching for water, food or mates, Pérez said. Researchers have been studying wildlife on the ranch using motion-sensor cameras, and they used to see animals like bobcats and mountain lions moving north and south. Lately they see those animals looping back, unable to find a way.\n“They don't know how to cross and how to get to the habitat,” Pérez said.\nIn one part of this border ranch, some animals once crossed to the U.S. side to drink at a windmill. When the barrier went up, Pérez and others rehabilitated an old well and used a solar-powered pump to create a water source on the Mexican side of the border.\nNow animals of all sorts — mountain lions, racoons, skunks — come to drink, appearing regularly on wildlife cameras.\nBut the new watering hole doesn’t solve the much bigger problems for wildlife and the ecosystem, Pérez said. The barrier bisecting their habitat blocks the movement of individuals, which is vital for maintaining healthy populations.\n“Diversity depends on a continuous flow of new individuals,” Pérez said. If the flow is cut off, “everything is going to be struggling.”\nPérez leads the nonprofit Cuenca de los Ojos A.C., which manages 131,000 acres across nine ranch properties on the Mexican side of the border. The cattle ranches are maintained as conservation lands and have been used by researchers studying rare species from bees to desert fish for years.\nThe name Cuenca Los Ojos refers to \"ojo de agua,\" meaning a spring or waterhole, and translates as “watershed of the springs.” Parts of the land have water in pools and streams year-round, like the flowing stretches of the San Bernardino River and wetlands in Mexico just south of the lush oasis at the San Bernardino National Wildlife Refuge on the U.S. side, which attracts a rich variety of migrating birds.\nIn a pond a few hundred yards south of the border, American coots bobbed in the water. Other birds squawked in the surrounding mesquites and willows.\nA central focus of the organization’s work has been maintaining the wildlife corridors and restoring streams and grasslands.\nValer Clark, the organization’s founder, has led the efforts to restore the watersheds. The lands were previously degraded by decades of overgrazing, upstream forest-cutting and erosion. The restoration work has involved ancient techniques building thousands of loose rock water-catchment structures called trincheras and larger permeable rock-filled structures called gabions. The structures hold back soil and sediment, prevent further erosion and help recharge the aquifer.\nThe construction work left a wide strip of denuded lands, which Pérez and others fear could worsen erosion.\nPérez is also concerned about water pollution from the rusting metal of the wall itself. And he worries that the illumination from the powerful lights on the wall, if turned on, could alter the nocturnal movements of insects, birds and bats.\nThere are also unknowns about how the construction has affected — and will affect — water sources.\nGroundwater was pumped from two wells near the national wildlife refuge starting in October 2019 for construction, according to Customs and Border Protection. About 128 million gallons were withdrawn.\nDuring an extremely dry year, Pérez said, that pumping sucked out a lot of water and left “less water running through the system.”\nOver the long term, the barrier could also affect the flow of water across the border during storms. In 2014, Hurricane Odile drenched the valley and unleashed floodwaters that reached about three feet deep in places, Pérez said. He wonders what would happen in a flash flood now that the wall runs through low-lying parts of the watershed.\nIn the San Bernardino National Wildlife Refuge, a series of gates were built as part of the wall, which Border Patrol says it will open during large floods.\nBut Pérez said no one knows how those gates could be opened quickly in the sort of flood that regularly inundated the area during heavy monsoon rains.\nIn a big flood, he said, debris could pile up along the wall, hindering the flow of floodwaters along the San Bernardino River.\n“Every creek and every arroyo has a door and a lock. Imagine the timing to open all in an event of flooding. I don’t know how they are going to be doing that,” he said. “It will be collecting more and more trees and sediment and junk. It will block the water. It will be a big concern.”\nWalking along the wall, Pérez paused and rapped his knuckles on a rusting metal gate.\n“We are trying to restore the natural flow of water,” Pérez said. “It’s going to change it a lot.”\nWhen he reached the San Bernardino River, he peered at a pond on the U.S. side. The river, a small creek at that point, poured through openings in the wall, cascading with a trickling sound, and flowed on into Mexico, where thick vegetation lined its banks.\nPreviously, there had been only a small bridge and Normandy-style barriers here. When crews erected the wall, they pumped the river dry while they worked, Pérez said.\nA large red hose, apparently left over from that work, dangled through an opening in the wall, lying in the stream.\nConstruction workers also laid a deep concrete foundation and Perez said it’s unclear how that barrier could affect the flow of shallow groundwater along the border.\n“It’s 10 feet deep, full of concrete,” Pérez said. “We don’t know how the aquifer is going to be affected.”\nAscending the Huachuca Mountains in southeast Arizona, golden grassland turns green, a woodland of oak and juniper. At higher elevations, the landscape turns into ponderosa pine forest. The temperature drops drastically.\n“This is why this is arguably some of the highest biodiversity in the U.S.,” said Aletris Neils, a biologist who runs Conservation CATalyst, a Tucson-based group that monitors populations of jaguars and ocelots in Arizona.\nIn January, an ocelot was photographed in these mountains. That same month, a jaguar was photographed about 100 miles east, in another southeast Arizona mountain range.\nAt the top of Montezuma Pass, a scenic overlook, the black line of border wall can be seen snaking east until it disappears on the horizon. Neils looked out at the valley below, which is a known wildlife migration corridor.\n“If we don't act, we're not going to have jaguars and ocelots in the future,” she said.\nIn a side canyon nearby, the winds disappear and the air grows still. A sycamore grows beside several species of oak. A waist-high Yucca madrensis, which grows in these mountains and in northern Mexico, stands beside a burst of Huachuca agave. This is where north meets south, where the Rocky Mountains, Sierra Madre, and Sonoran and Chihuahuan deserts converge.\n“They call this the borderlands, but I actually see it as the heartland of North America,” said Traphagen. “The black bear and the jaguar cross paths, the javelina and the coatimundi. White-tailed deer. Everything kind of occurs here. It's this meeting ground.”\nMountain canyons are important migration corridors because they provide cover, water and rich food sources. Rivers like the San Pedro are also natural migratory pathways, providing water and shade in an arid landscape.\nDuring the Bush administration, conservationists and the federal government arrived at a compromise to use vehicle barriers, passable by most animals, instead of steel fencing in some of these corridors.\nUnder Trump's leadership, only about 55 miles of border fencing were constructed in areas, like remote mountain ranges, where no barriers previously existed. The rest of the 226 miles built in Arizona replaced vehicle barriers or previous types of bollard or wire-mesh fencing designed to prevent humans from illegally crossing the border, according to Customs and Border Protection spokesperson Matthew Dyman.\nNow, the entire stretch of border between Coronado National Memorial and Guadalupe Canyon near the New Mexico state line, about 70 miles, is an unbroken stretch of barrier, cutting most species off from populations in Mexico.\nThe borderlands are the northernmost or southernmost habitats for many species. Scientists and environmentalists say this fragmentation caused by the wall could devastate genetic diversity, with cascading effects on the ecosystem.\n“Things like the jaguar are charismatic and they tend to suck the air out of the room,” said Traphagen. “What I’m worried about is the everyday impacts on common species: deer, mountain lions, javelina, bighorn sheep.”\nIn such a dry environment, animals need more space to roam to find seasonal water sources and forage, Traphagen said, especially during an extremely hot and dry year like 2020.\n“So in a time when animals need more space in order to fulfill their life cycles and needs, they’re getting that fragmented,” he said.\nIn its Environmental Stewardship Plan for border wall construction, Customs and Border Protection acknowledged that larger mammals, such as jaguars, could “experience the loss of genetic diversity when populations across the border are no longer able to mate.”\nThe plan says the new fencing includes openings for wildlife, 8 by 11 inches, placed intermittently. But conservationists say those openings, about the size of a piece of standard printer paper, are much too small for most species and that animals are unlikely to walk along the wall to find a way through.\nTraphagen has already seen a drastic change in the behavior of mountain lions in the San Bernardino National Wildlife Refuge. He has been monitoring the area using trail cameras since last year and has been tracking construction since it began.\nBefore the wall, mountain lions often passed from north to south. Now they're blocked.\n“I think what they’re doing is they’re coming down, there’s the wall, they pace back and forth and then go back and they just keep repeating this same cycle,” Traphagen said.\nSky Island Alliance, a conservation group that focuses on the borderlands, has been studying wildlife along a stretch of the border since last March. So far, the group has photographed 106 species with trail cameras at 58 sites on both sides of the border.\n“We didn't expect to have more than a hundred species within the first six months of the study,” said Emily Burns, program director for the group. “That was just really exciting to us. We knew this is a highly biodiverse region, but it's been so fantastic seeing the number of species that are present.”\nThey’ve captured images of North American porcupines, whose southernmost range is in the borderlands, as well as white-nosed coati, a subtropical mammal whose northern range is in Arizona.\n“The border wall could really isolate a smaller population of coatis in the United States from the core population,” Burns said.\nIn southern Arizona, the decline of the endangered Sonoran pronghorn serves as an example for how fragmentation can devastate a species.\nIn the early 2000s, a combination of border wall construction, development, drought and the expansion of Highway 2, a major interstate just south of the border, reduced the U.S. population of pronghorn to just 25 individuals. There was still a healthy population of 600 in Mexico, but the U.S. group could not maintain genetic diversity because they could no longer cross the border.\nTo salvage the species, scientists started a captive breeding program in 2004. Now there are about 460 wild Sonoran pronghorn in the state, according to John Hervert, Arizona Game and Fish Department's lead for Sonoran pronghorn recovery.\n“We know that one of the biggest causes of mortality for the Sonoran pronghorn is that they were having trouble getting across the border even before the wall went up because of the traffic on Mexican Highway 2,” said Gary Nabhan, an ecologist and author who has worked extensively in the borderlands. “Now we have a 30-foot wall. Those are basically two isolated populations now.”\nNabhan worries that many species could face the same fate with the new border fencing.\n“There's this anxiety because we don't know what's going to happen and how fast,” said Nabhan. “How does that affect plant populations or an animal population that was virtually cut in half by the fence? And how far does that effect ripple away from the border itself?”\nOn Jan. 19, the final full day for the Trump administration, crews were still at work in the Coronado National Memorial. Heavy machines were carving a road into a steep mountainside by the border.\nThe sounds of construction echoed through the grasslands, the beep-beep of trucks as they dumped boulders and sent them clattering down the hillside. A water truck chugged its way up the zigzagging road, spraying the dirt path with water to keep the dust down.\nNearby, a generator hummed beside a well, sending water pouring through a thick hose to a storage tank for construction.\nLooking through binoculars, Zoe Fullem followed the water truck as it climbed toward the peak.\nShe walked toward a spring, passing through trees. Reaching the streambed, her boots sank into dry sand. Fullem, community science manager for Sky Island Alliance, hasn’t seen any spring water here since the summer of 2020.\nFullem said it’s not clear how the groundwater pumping might have affected the spring. But the pumping, coupled with the dry year and the effects of climate change, only increases her concerns.\n“In such a dry place here, in the Sky Islands, springs are a really, really important source of perennial water for wildlife,” said Fullem. “Our data shows all sorts of wildlife use this water for drinking during times of the year when there aren’t any other water sources in the area.”\nData from Customs and Border Protection shows that at least 463 million gallons of groundwater were pumped from 24 wells along the border for construction purposes during the 2020 and 2021 fiscal years. For comparison, roughly 4,200 single-family homes in the Phoenix area could use that amount of water in a year. Three Arizona golf courses with average water consumption would use slightly more.\nThe agency’s environmental plan says the groundwater pumping could “have moderate to major adverse impacts on the availability of water resources in the region.”\nBut the effects of pumping haven't been well studied. And the government waived multiple environmental laws, so the effect of construction on springs and aquifers can only be speculated.\nThe spring that Fullem visited hasn’t had water since September.\nBrit Rosso, a former National Park Service employee who volunteers for the Sky Island Alliance, previously saw flowing water and pools here where animals would come to drink. Rosso stood on the dry streambed, where he has been coming regularly since 2019.\n“I’m disheartened but still optimistically hopeful that we’re going to see water here again,” Rosso said. “There are so few water sources as you go through here for wildlife. So, if they’re not getting it here, they’re going to have to go somewhere else and find water.”\nAfter surveying the spring and recording his observations on a tablet, Rosso walked uphill to another water source, a seep that formed a muddy puddle among bushes and deer grass.\n“This is providing a little sliver of life, of water, for wildlife,” Rosso said. “That’s just so encouraging.”\nThe Nde benah, or Traditional Territory, of the Chiricahua and Warm Springs Apache, two of four western Apache bands, span from the San Pedro River to the Rio Grande Valley, from northern Mexico to Interstate 40 in Arizona and New Mexico. Traditional lands of the O’odham — Tohono, Akimal, Ak-Chin and Hia-Ced — extend from the San Pedro to the Colorado River, from Phoenix to Hermosillo, Sonora.\nThe Apaches and O’odham long passed freely between what would later become the United States and Mexico.\n“This is where we were created and so this land to us is life and death,” said Joe Saenz, a Warm Springs Apache descendant and current Nantan, or president, of the Chiricahua Apache Nation, headquartered in southwest New Mexico and not yet recognized or acknowledged by the U.S. government.\nLike many borderlands tribes, the modern division of Apacheria, the lands inhabited by Apache peoples, began with the end of the U.S.-Mexico War in the mid-1800s, when the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo and the Gadsden Purchase drew a new line on the map. That didn’t stop Apache resistance as they fought off a genocide that didn't end until 1886, when Geronimo, the famous Apache leader, surrendered in the Peloncillo mountains in southeast Arizona.\nMany Apache were forcibly resettled on the San Carlos reservation farther north. Others were forced from the Traditional Territory, eventually displaced to the Fort Sill reservation in Oklahoma. But many, like Saenz’s ancestors, escaped to the Sierra Madre mountains in Mexico, remaining on the land they believe the Creator, Yusen, made for their people and their animal relatives.\nThe latest iteration of the border wall is yet another insult to the injury of that violent history, said Bill Swims After His Horses Bradford, the Nation’s attorney general, and shows a failure of the U.S. government to uphold its legal obligations under treaties negotiated in the mid-to-late 1800s.\n“Our relationship with this land is very intimate,” said Saenz. “The only way to describe this wall is like a hatchet to our body that cuts us in half. What we have been experiencing and what this land has been experiencing, it's pretty severe, pretty violent. And we see a very strong need to correct this.”\nThe Chiricahua were ignored in discussions about wall construction, but they hope the Biden administration will better engage with tribes. Even if there is more robust consultation, the Chiricahua and O’odham tribes say much of the damage has already been done.\nConstruction at O’odham sacred sites, like Quitobaquito Springs, has sparked outcry. Blasting of Monument Hill to make way for newer, taller barriers near Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument has disturbed burial sites.\n“Get a knife and cut across your chest and tell me if your chest is ever going to be the same,” said Verlon Jose, former chairman of the Tohono O’odham Nation. “Yes, it will heal, but there's going to be forever a scar there.”\nThere is an intimate connection between land, humans and animals in O’odham and Apache culture. It’s a reason the scars on the landscape have been particularly painful for them to witness. Some Chiricahua Apache say the wall is as much a desecration to their land as the Mount Rushmore monument is to the Lakota.\nThe Chiricahua consider all of their Traditional Territory sacred and their creation stories describe specific relationships with different animals. For example, the bear is highly respected and is not allowed to be hunted or touched. The coyote teaches the importance of balance in the ecosystem. Cutting off migration corridors puts these animals and the ecosystem at risk, Saenz said.\n“We can't separate ourselves from the environment, the animals,” Saenz said. “That’s what I foresee with all of this, that it's going to bleed into the air, the water, the animals, sooner or later.”\nAt the western edge of the Apaches’ ancestral territory, about 12 miles from the border, Sandy Anderson lives on land she bought in 1984. When Anderson first arrived, the property was filled with junk cars and garbage, but she said she saw it for what it could be.\nShe and her then-husband restored the grassland and trees. In 2001, she founded the nonprofit Gray Hawk Nature Center, and her home became a learning center for children. Now her back yard is part of the San Pedro Riparian National Conservation Area, a 40-mile federally protected stretch of the river.\nAnderson has led thousands of school kids along the river, teaching them about native wildlife and plants. She’s rescued or inherited dozens of reptiles, including a five-foot western diamondback, a skink and a Gila monster. She has two adopted wild horses that she trained herself. She befriended a roadrunner named Clack “that loved me unconditionally.” He was recently killed by a hawk. She wears one of Clack’s feathers in the band of her hat.\nOver the years, Anderson has watched monsoon floods swell the river to her doorstep. She thinks one good flood will knock out the 30-foot wall that now cuts across the river. Still, she worries for the effect on wildlife.\n“It is a travesty, a tragedy, against the natural world,” Anderson said, walking along the riverbank about 100 yards from her house. “It should have never happened. It has got to be fixed.”\nAnderson is saddened by what’s been lost in places like Guadalupe Canyon, where much of the damage is irreversible.\n“The mountains, they’ll never heal, not in many, many lifetimes,” Anderson said. “It literally is like having your heart ripped out for no reason. That wall stops everything but what it was intended to stop and the degradation that it has wrought on the landscape is incalculable.”\nNow that long stretches of wall are built, nearly 70 conservation groups on both sides of the border have been discussing ways of restoring habitats and blocked wildlife crossings. Their proposal lists 13 segments in Arizona they say should be removed or modified, from Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument to the Peloncillo Mountains at the New Mexico state line. Defenders of Wildlife, one of the groups that signed the proposal, published its own report based on this work.\nThese organizations are demanding that about 58 of the 226 miles of new fencing be removed and the land restored.\nBut not everyone agrees. The Malpai Borderlands Group, a coalition of ranchers and environmentalists in southeast Arizona, declined to sign the proposal, saying it didn’t fully address all their concerns, particularly about security.\n“We don’t think it addresses the security issue at all and that needs to be addressed. The fact of the matter is the wall hasn’t made the border any more secure,” said Bill McDonald, a fifth-generation rancher and founder of the group. “To me security is the number one thing and then you worry about wildlife migration, things like that.”\nMcDonald said the unfinished sections of the border wall pose a security risk and that the conservation groups’ proposal doesn’t address this issue in the areas where they think the wall should be removed. A wall was never the answer for McDonald; it was just “a political thing and I think that’s played out.”\nAnother proposal by the Borderlands Restoration Network, a nonprofit partnership of U.S. and Mexico-based conservationists, argues that restoring bladed land and blasted mountains using erosion control structures and native plants are immediate steps to mitigate damage.\nThey also want to see floodgates opened at waterways like the San Pedro. At least one of the floodgates was seen wide open at the river on March 14, and conservationists hope to see more of them permanently unlocked and pushed aside.\nUltimately, they want the restoration to be more holistic, a way to address unemployment and support healthy cross-border relations.\n“The wall should be removed in selected places. We're not talking about a massive tear down&mldr we think that ought to be done very carefully and with a lot of thought as to what the security concerns are,” said Ron Pulliam, an ecologist and founder of the network, who co-authored the proposal.\nClark, the founder of Cuenca Los Ojos, said in some areas, the techniques she has used can help restore the land. She said building rock structures that help prevent erosion is one way to address cleared areas that are prone to flooding.\n“The only thing you can do now is try and avoid massive erosion problems,” Clark said. “When you scar up a mountainside so that there's no vegetation, nothing left, you really don't know until the first big monsoon what's going to happen.”\nIn February, Babbitt and Jewell, the former interior secretaries, said in a letter to Biden that they believe “a new approach is desperately needed, one that restores degraded lands and waters.”\nBabbitt and Jewell signed the letter along with 26 conservation advocates, tribal leaders and others, calling for removal of “strategic segments” of the wall. They’re urging the administration to “mitigate the worst impacts of the border wall by reopening critical wildlife corridors, restoring riparian habitats, and healing the scars of construction before seasonal monsoon rains make the situation much worse.”\nThey also called for employment opportunities to restore the borderlands as part of Biden’s plans for a Civilian Climate Corps.\n“Federal investment in a restoration economy will benefit both people and nature, with returns far exceeding program costs, and improve the United States’ relationship with our southern neighbor and close ally,” Babbitt and Jewell said in the letter.\nIf left unchanged, the environmental damage from new sections of wall will accumulate over time, Babbitt said in an interview.\n“It's time now to step back from this pell-mell,\" Babbitt said. \"We're going to wreck everything without regard to any kind of environmental impact. Step back and pause and analyze all of the tradeoffs in terms of, are all of these stretches necessary? The answer, I think, would be clearly no.”\nBabbitt noted that barriers have walled off the border in many areas for decades, and he said he thinks there are places where having those barriers makes sense.\n“But what happened here is they just went ahead and said, ‘We want a barrier all the way,’ irrespective of the tradeoffs and the actual necessity and the damage to the environment and wildlife corridors,” Babbitt said.\n“Those decisions, those tradeoffs have never been discussed,” he said. “And that, to me, is really the beginning point for the changes that ought to take place.”\nThe majority of the U.S.-Mexico border in Arizona falls in the district of Rep. Raúl Grijalva, D-Ariz., who has been a vocal opponent of a physical border barrier since before a 30-foot wall became one of Trump’s signature campaign promises.\nWhile he supports wall removal, Grijalva, who also serves as chair of the House Committee on Natural Resources, said the first step has to be a scientific study on the wall’s effects. He said he thinks a study would prove that the wall “is unnecessary and does quantifiable damage to the environment and the people of the borderlands.”\nIn 2019, Trump declared a national emergency at the U.S.-Mexico border, saying it “presents a border security and humanitarian crisis that threatens core national security interests.” This paved the way for the administration to issue dozens of waivers, bypassing environmental and cultural laws.\nThe controversial executive power was made possible after the Sept. 11 attacks, when Congress granted then-President George W. Bush the authority to sidestep the laws to speed up border wall construction on the California-Mexico border. The waiver authority wasn’t limited to that period of time, so the Trump administration used it to accelerate border wall construction during his term.\nGrijalva said he’d like to see those environmental waivers repealed and he expects that will be discussed in Congress.\nReflecting the deep political divisions on the issue, Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich filed a lawsuit against the Department of Homeland Security this month arguing that, in halting construction, the Biden administration flouted compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act.\nEnvironmental activists have said construction continued past the seven days to wind down allowed by Biden’s presidential proclamation.\nAs of Jan. 19, there were approximately 18 miles of incomplete new border barrier in Arizona. The additional work was related to making incomplete sections safe, including transporting heavy machinery, storing and securing materials and preparing sites to stop work, CBP spokesperson Rob Daniels said in an emailed response to questions from The Arizona Republic.\nWork near Walker Canyon in the Pajarito Mountains “was delayed for more than a week due to inclement weather,” Daniels wrote. “If this area is not stabilized, there is a serious risk of slope failure causing both safety and environmental issues if left as is.”\nIn some areas, the 30-foot fencing comes to an abrupt halt, leaving an open border where vehicle barriers were shoved aside or mountains bulldozed for a wall not yet built.\nFor example, near the town of Sasabe, 20 foot gaps in fencing were blocked by barbed wire or stacked bollard fencing that had not yet been erected. A small mountain at the end of the segment had been blasted through, its steep face now sandy and bare.\nIf conservation advocates have their way, this section of wall — along with other parts across Guadalupe Canyon and the San Pedro River — will come down.\nA year ago, the San Pedro River, flowing north from its headwaters in Mexico, passed quietly into the United States under a steel bar across the riverbed. Border patrol agents parked their trucks on either side of the river.\nOn a wintry afternoon, an agent sat in his truck, his tattooed arm hanging out the window. He was a combat veteran, he said, and he liked patrolling the river. It was mostly peaceful and serene, a far cry from the chaos he had experienced in Iraq and Afghanistan. He’d even seen a few mountain lions slink across the border at night.\nThat day, there were signs of what was to come. Pink flags were tied around a dozen or so cottonwoods. The words “remove trees” were scribbled on small wood posts placed in front of them.\nA year later, those cottonwood trees are gone. Thirty-foot fencing has replaced the Normandy-style vehicle barrier in the riverbed. The dirt patrol road is now a cement bridge. Light poles 100 feet tall loom above the remaining cottonwoods. Boulders cover the ground below.\nIn early February, the river flowed through a 15-by-20 foot floodgate, its steel bars reflected in the calm, ankle-deep water. For a few yards, the river disappeared under the rocks. Then it reemerged, continuing on its northward path.\nSupport local journalism: Subscribe to azcentral.com today.\nEnvironmental coverage on azcentral.com and in The Arizona Republic is supported by a grant from the Nina Mason Pulliam Charitable Trust.

            "report_content": "In his final months in office, Donald Trump has ramped up construction on his promised physical border between the US and Mexico – devastating wildlife habitats and increasing the migrant death toll\nLast modified on Fri 29 Oct 2021 12.36 BST\nAt Sierra Vista Ranch in Arizona near the Mexican border, Troy McDaniel is warming up his helicopter. McDaniel, tall and slim in a tan jumpsuit, began taking flying lessons in the 80s, and has since logged 2,000 hours in the air. The helicopter, a cosy, two-seater Robinson R22 Alpha is considered a work vehicle and used to monitor the 640-acre ranch, but it’s clear he relishes any opportunity to fly. “We will have no fun at all,” he deadpans.\nMcDaniel and his wife, Melissa Owen, bought their ranch and the 100-year-old adobe house that came with it in 2003. Years before, Owen began volunteering at the nearby Buenos Aires National Wildlife Refuge, and fell in love with the beauty and natural diversity of the area, as well as the quiet of their tiny town. That all changed last July when construction vehicles and large machinery started “barrelling down the two-lane state road”, says Owen.\nOnce work on President Donald Trump’s border wall began, construction was rapid. Sasabe, a sleepy border town, located over an hour from the nearest city of Tucson, was transformed into a construction site. “I don’t think you could find a single person in Sasabe who is in favour of this wall,” Owen says.\nThe purpose of our helicopter trip today is to see the rushed construction work occurring just south of the couple’s house, as contractors race to finish sections of the border wall before Trump leaves office. Viewed from high above the Arizona desert, in the windless bubble of the cockpit, this new section of wall stretches across the landscape like a rust-coloured scar. McDaniel guides us smoothly over hills and drops into canyons, surveying the beauty of the landscape. Here, as on much of the border, the 30ft barrier does not go around; it goes over – stubbornly ploughing through cliffs, up steep mountainsides, and between once-connected communities.\n“That was already a pretty good barrier,” McDaniel says of the steep, unscalable cliff in front of us. The bulldozed path of Trump’s wall creeps up over the mountain’s west side, but on the other side of the cliff there is no wall, just a large gap. As with many areas on the border, the wall here is being built in a piecemeal fashion. According to the US Army Corps of Engineers, there are 37 ongoing projects, of which only three are set to be completed this month; others have completion dates as far away as June 2022.\nIn August, at a virtual press conference with the National Association of Hispanic Journalists, Joe Biden told reporters that “there will not be another foot of wall constructed on my administration”. The 37 existing construction sites, in various stages of completion, are likely to be shut down.\nYet he will have to formulate a more complex policy than simple suspension. Many of the private contractors building the wall have clauses in their contracts that will trigger large payouts if the government simply stops construction. There are also ongoing legal cases brought by private landowners from whom the government seized land. The exact nature of these obligations may only be clear to Biden once he takes office.\nIn the meantime, Trump has accelerated building in the wake of the election, with crews working flat out, late into the night. Throughout December and into January, mountainsides were exploded with dynamite and large portions of desert bulldozed, to make way for a wall that may not be finished in time.\nFor the past four years, I have been living in New Mexico, travelling in the borderlands and documenting the ongoing impact of the wall on communities and the environment.\n“They started working nights six weeks ago,” says photographer John Kurc, who has been documenting construction in the remote Guadalupe Canyon in Arizona since October last year. “It’s been nonstop ever since.”\nVerlon Jose, former vice-chair of the Native American Tohono O’odham Nation, tells me he has seen the wall plough through his ancestral homeland. “We are caretakers of this land. We are responsible for these things. Has anyone ever asked for permission from the local folks to do the construction? This is about President Donald Trump. It’s not about protecting America. It’s about protecting his own interests.”\nWhen construction stops, there will be large gaps in the new wall. In some places it will join up with older barriers that the Trump administration deemed inadequate; in others it will finish abruptly. “They work as fast as they can to build walls that will just end,” says McDaniel, as his helicopter circles back toward their property over saguaro-studded hillsides just north of the Mexican border. We drop altitude and approach the landing strip – a patch of dirt just off the road – whipping up a small dust storm as we touch the ground.\nAfter four years of daily scandals, and the shocking scenes in Washington DC last week, it’s easy to forget that Donald Trump was elected in 2016 with one signature policy: to build a wall. That was the call echoed at his rallies, the embodiment of Trump’s hardline approach to immigration and his purported “America First” ideology. Trump claimed the wall would address an invasion of undesirable migrants, “bad hombres”, a nationalist rhetoric that resonated with his base. During his first week in office, Trump signed an executive order that included a policy for “the immediate construction of a physical wall on the southern border”.\nConstruction began in 2019, mostly replacing existing fences, vehicle barriers, and other border structures, as well as unwalled sections of the border. The bollard wall, Trump’s barrier of choice, consists of a series of vertical steel posts set in concrete, with small gaps in between. While in some places it reaches a height of 30ft, it is less of a wall and more of an imposing metal fence.\nAccording to Kenneth Madsen, an associate professor in the department of geography at Ohio State University, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has waived 84 laws and statutes – many enacted specifically to protect the nation’s most treasured cultural and ecological sites – in order to expedite construction.\nDozens of environmental and public health laws were brushed aside to build walls through parks and wildlife areas, including Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument, Cabeza Prieta National Wildlife Refuge, San Bernardino National Wildlife Refuge and Coronado National Memorial. “It has brought devastation to the environment and the communities of the borderlands,” says Scott Nicol, author of a 2018 report for the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) about the impact of the wall, and a resident of the Rio Grande valley in Texas.\nNicol believes the wall’s charted course has been determined by ease rather than efficacy. Construction has been much busier on federally owned land, not because that’s where there are likely to be more border crossings, but because building on private property is a lengthy process. “Texas has the most border but the least wall mileage to date because the Texas borderlands are mostly in private hands,” says Nicol.\nAccording to the US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agency, 452 miles of border wall have been constructed under the Trump administration, at an estimated cost of $15bn, one of the most expensive infrastructure projects in US history. In September 2019, Trump promised to build between 450 and 500 miles of wall, so he has reached this goal – even if the vast majority of it is replacing existing barriers.\nOn Tuesday, days after the violent insurrection at the White House, Trump made a final visit to the border in Texas to celebrate reaching this target. During a short speech, he skirted any responsibility for the capital siege, and instead remarked on his successes in halting illegal immigration and securing the border.“When I took office, we inherited a broken, dysfunctional and open border,” he said. “We reformed our immigration system and achieved the most secure southern border in US history.”\nHas it had any impact on immigration? According to attorney David Donatti, from the ACLU of Texas, the answer is no. In recent months, according to CBP data, the number of people trying to cross has increased. “The wall as a whole is unlikely to have any discernible impact,” says Donatti. “In a race to construct, the administration is building where it’s easier as opposed to where most people cross.”\nAnd while the wall may be an impressive barrier, it is far from impregnable. Just after Christmas, Nicol visited a new section in the Rio Grande valley between Texas and Mexico and found numerous ladders scattered on the ground. “You can always go over,” he says.\nYou can also go through. John Kurc started using drones to photograph and video the construction of the wall. The last time he was in the border town of Sonoyta, Mexico, he saw two young men with “yellow, handheld angle grinders” cutting through the wall while a lookout with a radio watched for Border Patrol. “They would put the section back with a special bonding agent and then use paint that oxidizes the same colour as the bollards,” says Kurc. “Then they just go in and out.”\nGil Kerlikowske, the Obama-appointed former commissioner of the CBP, says there is not a one-size-fits-all solution for border security: “There are places where the environment is difficult and so remote you don’t need any barrier at all.” In these areas, surveillance and detection technologies would be more useful and cost-efficient, he argues. “It is such an unbelievably complex problem. When someone proposes a simple solution to a complex problem, you can be sure that’s the wrong solution.”\nThat’s not to say Trump’s wall has had no impact. Back on the ranch, cameras set up by Melissa Owen have captured passing wildlife – mountain lions and javelina, pig-like mammals, the skulls of which can also be found around the house. “There were no environmental surveys, no groundwater surveys, none of that,” says Owen. Once contractors arrived in town last summer, they began “pumping enormous amounts of water out of the ground” in order to mix concrete for the border wall’s foundations.\nResidents in Sasabe began complaining of reduced water pressure. At San Bernardino National Wildlife Refuge, groundwater pumping for concrete began draining a crucial wetland and endangering four threatened species of fish. Similar concerns were raised when the Quitobaquito Springs at Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument, home to the endangered desert pupfish began to dry out as contractors pumped water from the ancient aquifer that fed it. “That’s our water – that’s what we depend on,” says Owen, looking out towards arid ranchland that is suffering from a long drought.\nMyles Traphagen, borderlands coordinator of the Wildlands Network conservation group, has called Trump’s wall the “single most damaging project” to the ecology of the mountainous Sky Islands region and the animals that call it home – especially the jaguar, which has made a remarkable comeback in the US after being hunted to extinction by the late 1960s.\n“We had three different jaguars in 2015 and 2016, which hadn’t happened since the 1930s,” says Chris Bugbee, a senior researcher at Conservation CATalyst, an organisation dedicated to the world’s 38 wild cat species.\n“If this border wall hadn’t started, we expected a female to eventually arrive and have breeding jaguars again,” adds Aletris Neils, Conservation CATalyst’s executive director.\nThe jaguar is one of numerous species – such as the endangered ocelot and the Mexican gray wolf – found in a region that extends from south-western New Mexico into western Arizona and far down into Mexico. If current border wall construction is completed, says Traphagen, “93% of jaguar habitat will have been walled off”.\nOnly males have been seen in the US since the 60s. They have huge ranges and some travel north where there is plenty to eat, before returning south to find a mate. There is currently one jaguar (whose location cannot be shared due to poaching concerns) on the US side, cut off from Mexico because of the wall.\nBugbee has spent years tracking the famous “El Jefe” jaguar, one of the few sighted recently in the US, with his dog Mayke. “We haven’t seen signs of any jaguars since construction began,” he tells me when we meet at the Coronado National Forest, where he previously tracked the cat. A mile or so away, construction workers have been blasting and bulldozing over the steep Montezuma Pass, where another jaguar, known as Yo’oko, once roamed.\nOwen and McDaniel are far from open-border liberals. The entrance to their ranch has a sign that reads: “Border Patrol always welcome”. Owen’s two horses, Rocker and Kiowa, are retired Border Patrol horses – “the best”, she says of their temperament. In her early years on the ranch, Owen says, undocumented migrants and smugglers were coming across the border in large numbers. She would frequently encounter migrants on her property. One morning someone broke into her house. “I don’t want it to go back to then,” she says, but adds that the economic downturn of 2008 has slowed immigration considerably. “No one wants a secure border more than I,” she says. “But a 30ft-tall, poorly constructed barrier is not the answer. It’s a campaign gimmick. My neighbourhood is being destroyed because a megalomaniac wants to pacify his supporters.”\nDuring his election campaign, Trump claimed that Mexico would pay for the wall. Once he was in office, Congress provided some $1.37bn a year for construction, but each year the president demanded more, ultimately declaring a national emergency in order to divert military funds to pay for the wall. It’s estimated by the US Army Corps of Engineers that Biden will save about $2.6bn if he stops construction on the border wall in his first day in office.\nTrump, and some within CBP, have maintained that the wall is a crucial means of halting smuggling. “Illegal drug and human smuggling activities have decreased in those areas where barriers are deployed. Illegal cross-border traffic has also shifted to areas with inferior legacy barriers or no barriers at all,” said a DHS spokesperson in a recent email to the Guardian.\nKerlikowske, who also served as director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy between 2009 and 2014, admits that drug trafficking is a problem. However, he points out that the vast majority of illicit substances, such as fentanyl, cocaine and heroin, are smuggled through legal ports of entry where elaborate walls and security systems already exist. “During my time as commissioner, I met with hundreds of border patrol agents. No one in the border patrol says we really need a wall,” he says.\nDonatti from the ACLU of Texas says there is little evidence that walls deter either drugs or undocumented immigration, which is being driven primarily by so-called push factors (war, poverty, desperation) in other countries. “The US federal government has tried to study this several times and has never found support that a border wall stops the flow of undocumented immigration,” he says.\nOne thing border walls are effective at is increasing the number of migrant deaths. As the US has walled off more of its border, the risk to migrants crossing illegally has increased. Since 1998, around 7,000 people have died along the US-Mexico border, the majority in Arizona’s rural deserts and, in recent years, the Rio Grande valley.  “As you keep building, you keep pushing people into more remote and dangerous areas,” says Donatti.\n“It’s a humanitarian disaster,” agrees Eddie Canales, of the South Texas Human Rights Center, who has spent the past decade operating hundreds of water stations in the Rio Grande valley in Texas to save migrants. “We do what we can,” Canales told the Guardian in early 2020. “But people keep dying.” The wall funnels people into more dangerous crossing points, where physical barriers do not yet exist. Summer temperatures in the Arizona desert are brutal; 2020 became the deadliest year since 2010 for those who crossed the border there.\n“It’s hard for people to understand what this means to us, as O’odham and Native Americans. What it means to us as the original indigenous peoples of this land,” says Verlon Jose.\nWhen I visit Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument, a pristine tract of Sonoran desert, earlier this year, contractors are busy dynamiting Monument Hill, a sacred mountain and burial site for the Tohono O’odham people. Uprooted saguaros, the huge, tree-like cacti sacred to the tribe, dot the path of the wall. “It was like, ‘Tell me where your grandparents live, and I’ll put a wall through there,’” says Jose.\n“In certain areas, we won’t be able to continue our traditional practices,” says Jose, whose tribal members span both sides of the border. “We spent billions of dollars on the wall. Why don’t we invest it in our border cities and towns?”\nAccording to Norma Herrera, a border resident from McAllen, Texas, the wall’s $15bn price tag is an insult to one of the county’s most impoverished regions, where critical infrastructure is often lacking. This issue was laid bare during the pandemic, when places such as the Rio Grande valley in Texas, a centre of border wall construction, was devastated by Covid. Hospitals reached capacity, deaths mounted, and all the while, the wall continued to rise.\n“We had more deaths in the region than the entire state,” says Herrera, community organiser at the Rio Grande Valley Equal Voice Network, which advocates for marginalised groups in the area. “To see the wall going up, to see resources used on useless steel and concrete, it’s senseless.”\nAccording to Donatti, whose parents originally emigrated from Argentina to the US, the wall should be seen in the context of broader exclusion policies – such as the Remain in Mexico programme enacted by Trump, under which asylum seekers arriving at ports of entry are returned to Mexico to wait for their US immigration proceedings. “It’s this idea that there is a fundamental Americanness, and either you’re inside, or you’re out,” he says.\nThat idea was evident in late 2019, when I visited a shelter in Tijuana. The two-storey building in the neighbourhood of Benito Juárez was packed with families, with mattresses sprawled over every inch of open floor. At that time in Tijuana, nearly 10,000 asylum seekers were waiting for their immigration hearings after being turned back at the border and sent to one of the most dangerous cities in Mexico.\nMany are hopeful that under the Biden administration the approach to migrants and the borderlands will change; that policies such as Remain in Mexico will be undone; and even that sections of the border wall will be removed. A week after inauguration day, a coalition of groups across the borderlands will begin a monitoring project in order to assess the damage, and to see what needs to be done. Some hope certain sections can be removed in order to reconnect critical habitats and communities.\nVerlon Jose of the Tohono O’odham has a “sliver of hope” that some of the walls will come down. “I believe Biden will not build another inch,” he adds.\nOthers are not so sure. “Optimism? No,” says Donatti of the prospect of the wall coming down. “He hasn’t committed to as much. But there is a strong coalition along the border that will be fighting for it.”\nJohn Kurc, who has spent thousands of hours watching the destruction of Guadalupe Canyon, sees the scale of the challenge. “The Trump administration has caused so much damage to these environments,” he says, peering through a set of binoculars as a crane hoists up an isolated section of wall, with huge gaps on each side. “We have a lot of work to do.”\nThis article was amended on 18 January 2021.

Now theyâre starting to take him literally.]\nThe southern border of Texas is technically somewhere in the middle of the Rio Grande. The river has changed course in the past, creating \nboundary disputesÂ between the United States and Mexico.\nThe existing border fencing in southern Texas often sits far from the river, outside its flood plains â creating wide seams between the fence and the official border.\nSome Americans live on the Mexican side of the border fence.\nRiver Bend Resort, a golf course and residence in Brownsville, Tex., sits between a gap in the existing fence. If the wall were completed, based on U.S. regulations, it would bisect the property, according to owner Jeremy Barnard. Roughly 200 residents and 15 of the 18 golf holes would sit south of the border wall.\nâWhat is the governmentâs plan? Are they going to come and buy out 200 people of their houses?â he said. âThereâs so much more to it than âletâs just build a wall.â â\n1,500 feet\n1,500 feet\n1,500 feet\nSecurity experts say that border barriers are merely obstacles to would-be crossers unless they are watched.

The number of Border Patrol officers has doubled in recent years. Checkpoints strategically line roads along the border. Where no fencing exists, cameras and sensors do.\nEfforts to build a âvirtual fenceâ to supplement the physical barrier have proven challenging.

            "report_content": "The U.S. Defense Department asked Congress to reprogram more than $3.8 billion from FY2021 funding for the National Guard and weapons programs to pay for a wall on the border with Mexico, setting another possible confrontation with Democrats. Three years after arriving at the presidency, Donald Trump is keeping his central promise of building a wall on the southern border of the nation and heads his campaign for a second term with the same motto. Democratic aides said $1.5 billion would come from the National Guard, and the rest from funds for procurement, including the Lockheed Martin Corp F-35 fighter jet program, Lockheed C-130 transport aircraft, Boeing Co P-8 Poseidon maritime patrol aircraft, Bell Boeing V-22 Osprey tilt-rotor aircraft, and shipbuilding. Congressional Democrats called the request dangerous and misguided.\nThe president and his administration announced plans in September 2019 to build between 450 and 500 miles (725 and 800 kilometers) of wall  along the nearly 2,000-mile (3,220-kilometer) border by the end of 2020. In some sections, a 30-foot-high wall will replace sections of Normandy barriers and post-n-beam fencing that by design only stop vehicles. Defense Department officials said 04 September 2019 that 127 military construction projects in both the United States and overseas will be deferred to free $3.6 billion for construction or augmentation of barriers along 175 miles of the southern US border.\nPresident Donald Trump announced on 15 Feburary 2019 he would declare a national emergency to try to obtain funds for his promised US-Mexico border wall bypassing Congress, a move Democrats vowed to challenge as unconstitutional. \"I'm going to be signing a national emergency,\" Trump said from the Rose Garden of the White House. \"We have an invasion of drugs, invasion of gangs, invasion of people and it's unacceptable,\" he said. The president said he would sign the authorising paperwork later in the day in the Oval Office, freeing Trump to seek to redirect billions of dollars of federal funds. The emergency declaration enabled the activation of any of hundreds of dormant powers, which can permit the White House to declare martial law, suspend civil liberties, expand the military, seize property and restrict trade, communications and financial transactions.\nThis reprogramming decision was made after President Trump had repeatedly sought appropriations from Congress for the construction of a border barrier. Although Congress provided some funding for those purposes, it consistently refused to pass any measures that met the Presidents desired funding level, creating a standoff that led to a 35-day partial government shutdown. The President signed the budget legislation that ended the shutdown, but he then declared a national emergency and pursued other means to get additional funding for border barrier construction beyond what Congress had appropriated.\nTrump declared a National Emergency to use section 2808 of title 10, United States Code to bypass congressional intent and divert military construction funding from previously approved national security projects to fund a border wall. Congress chose not to fund this wall in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2019 (P.L. 1166). There was bipartisan opposition to the action taken by the President, as both the House and Senate voted to disapprove the Presidents emergency declaration. The House and Senate adopted a joint resolution terminating the Presidents declaration of a national emergency pursuant to Congresss authority under 50 U.S.C. § 1622(a)(1). H.R.J. Res. 46, 116th Cong. (2019). The President vetoed the joint resolution.\nThe requirements of section 8005 were not met because the need for which the funds were reprogrammed was not unforeseen, and it was an item for which funds were previously denied by Congress. The use of those funds violated constitutional requirements that the Executive Branch not spend money absent any appropriation from Congress. But on 27 July 2019 a Supreme Court ruling allowed the President to start taking funds from the military to build his ineffective border wall while litigation continued.\nThe administration asked for $1.6 billion for 2018 to build or replace 74 miles (120 kilometers) of barriers in Texas' Rio Grande Valley and San Diego and planned to request another $1.6 billion for 2019. A proposal by Customs and Border Protection called for spending $18 billion over 10 years to extend barriers to cover nearly half the border. The agency proposed 316 miles (505 kilometers) of additional barrier by September 2027, bringing total coverage to 970 miles (1,552 kilometers). It also sought 407 miles (651 kilometers) of replacement or secondary fencing.\nThe U.S. House of Representatives closed its summer session 28 July 2017 with a key legislative accomplishment that included a gift for President Donald Trump. House Republicans included a $1.6 billion request to build part of Trumps promised wall along the U.S.-Mexico border in a mini-bus package of bills. We must be vigilant in protecting our homeland. Thats our priority. This legislation funds the most critical functions of government. It secures our borders by providing funding for a wall on our southern border, House Speaker Paul Ryan said in a statement hailing the passage of border wall funding.\nThe project is months behind schedule.  CBP officials said the winners would be announced in November 2017.\nDonald Trump told reporters on Air Force One 13 July 2017 that his previous remark about placing solar panels on his proposed border wall with Mexico was no joke. \"We have major companies looking at that,\" Trump said. \"Look, there's no better place for solar than the Mexico border  the Southern border. And there is a very good chance we can do a solar wall, which would actually look good.\" Because of the presence of natural barriers, Trump said, the solar wall would need to span only 700 to 900 miles (1,125 to 1,450 kilometers) to be effective in halting illegal migration.\nTrump told reporters on Air Force One that only 700 to 900 miles of wall may be needed. About 650 miles of the 2,000-mile long border already has some type of physical barrier. The remaining miles will be guarded by topography, the president said. You have mountains. You have some rivers that are violent and vicious. You have some areas that are so far away that you dont really have people crossing, he said. He also opined that the wall should be see-through, ie, a fence, not a wall. Border patrol agents needed to be able to spot threats on the other side and avoid any large sacks of drugs thrown over the top.\nExecutive Order 13767 directed the Government to build a border wall with Mexico. The entire U.S.-Mexico border covers 3,200 kilometers, over a variety of terrain, from California, through Arizona and New Mexico and ending in southern Texas. More than 1,100 kilometers of that stretch already is fenced, but nowhere is the barrier as massive as the wall described in the new plan.\nOn March 17, 2017 the US Customs and Border Protection released two Requests for Proposal to award multiple contracts and initial task orders for the design and construction of wall prototypes. The Presidential Executive Order: Border Security and Immigration Enforcement Improvements, states that the Secretary shall take steps to immediately plan, design and construct a physical wall along the southern border, using appropriate materials and technology to most effectively achieve complete operational control of the southern border.\nThe US government planned to start awarding preliminary contracts by April 2017 for construction of a wall along the US-Mexico border, to fulfill one of President Donald Trumps principal campaign promises. US Customs and Border Protection said it will accept \"concept papers\" for the walls design and choose the best ones by 20 March 2017. The agency will then ask vendors for construction cost estimates and, after reviewing their bids, begin granting contracts by mid-April  a remarkably quick schedule for a government construction project.\nTrump said the wall will cost $12 billion, while Republican leaders in Congress have pegged its cost 20 percent higher than that. An internal Homeland Security report forecast the total cost could be as much as $21.6 billion.\nThe situation reached an impasse in December 2018. During negotiations with Congress over an appropriations bill to fund various parts of the federal government for the remainder of the fiscal year, the President announced his unequivocal position that any measure that funds the government must include border security.  He declared that he would not sign any funding bill that did not allocate substantial funding for a physical barrier on the U.S.-Mexico border. But the President made clear that he still intended to build a border barrier, with or without funding from Congress.",

            "report_content": "Border walls came to symbolize Donald Trump’s presidential campaign, and were prioritized during his administration.  The 400 miles of border wall that he has overseen will inflict ongoing damage upon Native American nations and border towns, fragile ecosystems and endangered species, for as long as they stand.\nPresident-elect Biden has been far quieter regarding his plans for border walls.  When pressed during an NPR interview he said that “not another foot” would be built while he is in office, which sounds like a solid promise to cancel border wall condemnations and construction contracts on day one.\nBut Joe Biden has been in the White House before, as Vice President during the Obama administration.  Instead of halting construction and removing walls, they built more than 100 miles of new wall along the southwest border.\nIn 2006 then-President Bush signed the Secure Fence Act, which called for the erection of hundreds of miles of barriers along the U.S.-Mexico border.  The Bush Administration intended to build 700 miles by December of 2008, when his second term would come to an end.  By April of 2008 then-Homeland Security Secretary Chertoff had issued waivers that swept aside dozens of federal laws and “all federal, state, or other laws, regulations and legal requirements of, deriving from, or related to the subject of” the named laws for all of the planned border walls.\nBy the end of President Bush’s time in office the U.S.-Mexico border was lined with 278 miles of 15-to-18-foot-tall pedestrian fence and 248 miles of vehicle barrier, for a total of 526 miles.  Of those, 135 miles had been built prior to the passage of the Secure Fence Act.\nThe Obama-Biden Administration would oversee construction of an additional 128 miles of border wall.  When Donald Trump was inaugurated in January of 2017 a total of 654 miles of border barrier (including both pedestrian fencing and vehicle barrier) were waiting for him.\nBorder communities were rightly upset by continued wall construction during the Obama presidency.  Campaigning against Hillary Clinton in South Texas ahead of the 2008 Texas primary, candidate Obama said, “We have to work with local communities to deal with the border in intelligent ways.  We can’t do it by building a wall along the border. That’s not going to work.”\nFollowing Barack Obama’s victory he received a letter from Commissioners in Cameron County, an area of South Texas where walls had been planned under the Bush Administration but where, due to the time it took for the federal government to condemn private property, none had yet been built.  Expressing the wishes of border residents they wrote, “We respectfully ask that you make the cancellation of the border wall on the Southern Border a top priority of your administration.  Let us build bridges of friendship, safety, and prosperity – not walls of hatred and division.”\nMost of the South Texas walls would require the acquisition of private property, and the overwhelming majority of landowners in the path of these walls did not want to sell.  Hundreds of land condemnations, carried out by Justice Department lawyers, were necessary in order to build them.  Many of those condemnations were initiated under the Bush Administration, but they continued without pause under the Obama-Biden Administration.  In many instances the federal government did not obtain possession of properties until 2009 or 2010.\nBefore Barack Obama and Joe Biden moved into the White House not a single mile of border wall had been finished in South Texas’ Lower Rio Grande Valley. The bulk of construction there occurred in 2009 and 2010, but in a few locations it dragged on into 2011 and 2012.  By the end of their first term 54 miles had been built through South Texas communities and wildlife refuges.\nAt the other end of the border a section of wall planned for California’s Otay Mountain Wilderness Area also remained unfinished when Barack Obama was inaugurated.  Construction continued in early 2009, including the dynamiting away of 530,000 cubic yards of rock, which was allowed to tumble into the canyon below.  While most of the pedestrian walls and vehicle barriers in California, Arizona, and New Mexico were built in the 60-foot wide, federally owned Roosevelt Easement, at Otay the terrain was so rugged that the wall and patrol road had to repeatedly intrude into the wilderness area which, according to its federal designation, was supposed to be roadless.\nThe border wall through Smuggler’s Gulch, a canyon a few miles inland from the Pacific, was also completed during the Obama-Biden administration.  At Smuggler’s Gulch the tops of low mountains on either side of the canyon were demolished, and a 100-foot-tall earthen dam was built across it in order to create a level surface for the border wall and patrol road.  This led to serious erosion which washed into the Tijuana estuary, smothering vegetation under sediment.  The culvert meant to allow the Tijuana River to pass under the berm also ejected flood water with much greater force than in the past, causing nearby properties to suffer flood damage.\nThere were also numerous locations where pre-existing border walls were replaced under the Obama-Biden administration, including some in El Paso, Texas; near Naco, Arizona; and where the wall between San Diego and Tijuana enters the Pacific Ocean.  Sections of border wall that were swept away by flooding at Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument, near Nogales, Arizona, and through Andrade, California, were rebuilt during those eight years as well.\nAll of the border walls built or replaced during the Obama-Biden administration relied upon the waivers of federal laws issued under the Bush Administration that set aside relevant environmental laws, laws protecting Native American graves and religious practices, and regulations meant to shield farmland and historic sites.  The issuance of waivers under the REAL ID Act is up to the discretion of the Secretary of Homeland Security, and the Obama-Biden administration could have opted to comply with federal laws rather than use the preexisting waivers to ignore them when new border walls were erected or older ones were replaced.\nWith Joe Biden the winner of the 2020 presidential election the actions taken by the administration that he was previously a part of is not just of academic interest.  The past can be a predictor of the future, a warning of what could happen if those who care about the borderlands are too complacent.\nPresident Biden will inherit the 30-foot-tall border walls that the Trump administration has run through lands sacred to the O’odham and Kumeyaay peoples have already inflicted terrible damage.  Dynamite has ripped apart Monument Hill, despite the Tohono O’odham Nation telling Congress and Customs and Border Protection that there were burials there.  Jacumba and the flank of Tecate Peak have likewise been desecrated, despite Kumeyaay protests meant to protect the remains of their ancestors who are buried there.  These walls are a continued desecration so long as they stand.\nThe walls that the Trump administration blasted through the Peloncillo mountains, that scar the San Bernardino valley, and that cut across wild landscapes all across the southern border, bring the movement of wildlife to a dead stop.  For endangered species that live in the borderlands that means no access to critical sources of food and water, and small populations that may die out for lack of genetic diversity.  Walls that cut across Arizona’s San Pedro river and intrude into the floodplain of Texas’ Rio Grande will inevitably clog with debris during floods, dam water, then suffer catastrophic failure, with uprooted concrete and steel swept downriver.  The risk to wildlife and watercourses will not abate unless those walls are removed.\nPresident Trump’s border walls, like those erected by his predecessors, push border crossings into increasingly brutal terrain.  This was noted by the Government Accountability Office in the summer of 2006, shortly before the Secure Fence Act passed, when they reported that border crossing deaths had doubled as the first border walls went up in California.  Border walls in California pushed crossings into the Arizona desert; subsequent border walls in Arizona rerouted crossings into Texas, which for the past few years has seen far more deaths than Arizona.  In the first 9 months of 2020, even though more crossings (and, in recent years, more recorded deaths) occurred in Texas, the remains of more border crossers were recovered in Arizona than in any of the prior 7 years.  Border walls are the cause of hundreds of deaths each year.\nSo long as border walls remain standing those harms will continue, and will be compounded.  The Biden-Harris administration should not, therefore, adopt the stance that the Obama-Biden administration did when they inherited ongoing border wall projects.\nIn an interview over the summer Joe Biden said that, “There will not be another foot of wall constructed on my administration.”\nFor those of us on the ground in border communities “not another foot” has a specific, concrete meaning.  It is literal, not abstract.  It does not exclude walls that are in the planning stage.  It does not exclude contracts that have been awarded, but where work crews have yet to dig trenches or pour concrete or erect steel bollards.  It does not exclude walls that are part-finished, where one mile is up but nine more are not.  Not another foot means not another foot.\nFor that promise to hold true the Biden-Harris administration will need to instruct Justice Department lawyers to immediately end all court proceedings to condemn land for border walls.  They will need to cancel all ongoing border wall construction contracts.  They will need to immediately halt all border wall construction.\nDoing so would save hundreds of Texas landowners, stave off the devastation of wildlife refuges, and avoid the flooding of homes and farms along the Rio Grande.\nBut it would not repair the damage done by the walls that the Trump administration has already erected.  That will require the removal of border walls.\nThe Biden-Harris administration should tear down walls that desecrate sites that are sacred to the Kumeyaay, the O’odham, and other Native American nations.  They should tear down the walls that dam the San Pedro River, and the spring-fed streams of the San Bernardino National Wildlife Refuge, and that intrude into the floodplain of the Rio Grande.  They should tear down walls that rip apart endangered species habitat.  They should tear down walls that cut through border communities, casting prison-bar shadows on a child’s bedroom window.\nAt the end of the Obama-Biden administration there were 654 miles of border wall.  At the end of the Biden-Harris administration there should be none.\nScott Nicol is the coauthor of a pair of reports about border walls, titled Death, Damage and Failure: Past, Present, and Future Impacts of Walls on the U.S.-Mexico Border.  He is an Assistant Professor at South Texas College in McAllen, Texas.\nPrivacy Policy / Terms & Conditions\nSouthern Border Communities Coalition is a program of Alliance San Diego.\n© 2016-2019 ALLIANCE SAN DIEGO.

            "report_content": "A leading-edge research firm focused on digital transformation.\nGood\nSubscriber\nAccount active\n            since\nDonald Trump's vision of a \"big, beautiful wall\" between the US and Mexico arguably did more than anything else in his 2016 platform to propel him into the White House.\nBorder security experts, and many of Trump's allies, have pointed out that a wall alone is too blunt an instrument to help much with US border security issues.\nBut the architect of the policy, Sam Nunberg earlier explained to Business Insider that this lack of subtlety is exactly the point.\n\"The wall in 2016 was symbolic of Donald Trump: common sense, practical solutions, simplified answers — as opposed to long nuanced, detailed policy speak,\" he said\nTrump recently told a rally that the wall is \"almost complete\" — while his campaign website says 216 miles have been completed. It does not mention that the US-Mexico border is almost 2,000 miles long.\nHere is a run-down of the major promises the president has made about the wall.\nIn April 2014, as Trump prepared to begin his bid for the Republican nomination, he made his first mention of a wall — or at least a fence — at a New Hampshire conservative event.\nIn preparing for his speech to the Freedom Summit, advisers Sam Nunberg and Roger Stone struggled to remind Trump to center immigration in his speech. Trump was resolving to be \"the hardest on the Right\" on these issues, Nunberg later told Business Insider, but struggled to stick closely to prepared notes.\nThe simple idea of a wall appealed to Trump.\n\"We either have to have borders, and I mean strong borders ... and I mean strong. And you know I'm a builder, I build great buildings,\" Trump told his audience.\"Building a border, you know they talk about 'oh I don't know, how could we possibly build a fence that nobody can climb over?' I would build a border like nobody's seen before. Nobody's climbing over.\"\nAs Trump announced his candidacy for the Republican nomination, a new promise arose — and it appears to have been totally off the cuff.\"I will build a great, great wall on our southern border, and I will make Mexico pay for that wall,\" he said. \"Mark my words.\"According to Ian Volner, who has chronicled the Trump wall in his book \"The Great Great Wall: Along the Borders of History from China to Mexico,\" the claim wasn't in the briefing notes circulated to journalists prior to his announcement speech.\nHis campaign quickly wound it back, qualifying the promise as it made headlines.\nWhether Mexico was paying literally or figuratively didn't turn out to matter that much. According to The Washington Post, Trump would go on to talk about a border wall more than 200 times on the tumultuous 2016 campaign trail.\n\"This will be a wall with a very big, very beautiful door, because we want the legals to come back into the country,\" Trump told CBS News. A big door to welcome documented immigrants hasn't been given much attention since. In a 2019 roundtable discussion on border security, Trump remarked on the doorways in an existing section of wall and suggested not having any.\n\"Because putting the doors on cost more than the property is worth,\" he said.\nAnti-immigration executive orders came at speed after Trump took office.\nThe Border Security and Immigration Enforcement Improvements set in officialese exactly what Trump meant by the wall — a definition that left room for the many, many visions the president has described since.\n\"'Wall' shall mean a contiguous, physical wall or other similarly secure, contiguous, and impassable physical barrier,\" read the order. With numerous natural barriers along the way, the amount of new construction has been reckoned at around 900 miles.\nWith this environmentally-friendly vision, proposed at a White House meeting with Republican congressional leaders, Trump suggested the costs of the wall could be covered by solar-power-generated electricity.\n\"We are seriously looking at a solar wall,\" said Trump, pointing out that the sun-drenched border would offer obvious opportunity.\nAs Business Insider's Leanna Garfield reported at the time, a solar-powered array could conceivably recuperate construction costs, but only over decades.\nIt was never mentioned again.\nIt's not possible to list all the times Trump has repeated his claim that Mexico will foot the bill for the wall, but The New York Times made a fact-check of the different ways that this could be done. These suggestions have ranged from cutting foreign aid to waiting for a literal check.\nTrump said it again during a G20 press conference in Hamburg with Mexican president Enrique Peña Nieto did nothing to bring that closer to reality.\nAs of time of publication, an official Trump campaign page called \"Promises Kept\" makes no mention of ways in which Mexico has, or will, contribute.\nIn 2017, the Department for Homeland Security priced the wall at $21.6 billion, Reuters reported.\nOthers disagreed. The Democratic Party asserted it would be at least $70 billion — plus maintenance costs — while a non-partisan oversight committee simply said the DHS costing was far too low.\nAfter another estimate suggested the wall would cost $18 billion, Trump ramped up expectations still further.\nDuring an immigration policy negotiation with Democrats, he said: \"I can build it for less than that  ... We can build the wall in one year and we can build it for much less money than what they're talking about,\" according to MailOnline.\nHe went on to talk about the Wollman Rink, an ice rink languishing under failed municipal repair and a spiraling budget until 1986, when he offered to take over the refurbishment. He completed it in four months and 25% under budget.\nHowever, with the scrutiny of Congress, he has not been able to repeat this success with his border wall.\nIn mid-December, as Congress was wrangling with the president over the next year's funding bill, Trump made a late-notice demand for $5 billion for his wall — much more than the $1.6 billion that the Democrats countered with for general border-security funding.\nThe standoff triggered a government shutdown that lastest well into the new year.\nTrump begrudgingly agreed to a package including $1.4 billion for barrier construction on January 15, ending the shutdown.\nA year after his self-imposed deadline, there was no completed wall. Instead, there were more attempts to salvage the idea that Mexico might foot the bill.\nOn January 10, Trump said: \"When, during the campaign, I would say Mexico is going to pay for it, obviously I never said this and I never meant they're going to write out a check.\"\nInstead, he said, Mexico will pay \"indirectly,\" through renegotiated trade deals. As Business Insider's Bob Bryan explained, that's not how it works.\nAfter the debacle of the government shutdown, Trump's next move was to declare the situation at the border a national emergency, enabling him to bypass Congress and approve billions in funding for his wall.\nAs he announced it, he told reporters: \"I could do the wall over a longer period of time. I didn't need to do this. But I'd rather do it much faster.\"Another $3.8 billion was raided from the Pentagon's budget for the wall, which was considered a \"higher priority item,\" NPR reported.\nWith the project clearly not going to plan, and an election looming, Trump told Fox 10 in Phoenix that the wall would continue even if he loses.\nHe predicted that Joe Biden would have to continue the project or there would be a \"revolution.\" Biden soon said the opposite: if he is elected, construction will stop.\nTrump, and his campaign, have made many different claims about how done the wall is. On the campaign trail on August 28, Trump told New Hampshire that the wall is \"almost complete.\"\nYet on the Trump campaign website \"Promises Kept,\" the wall's completion is discussed in the present tense.\n\"Pres. Trump is fulfilling his promise to build a border wall, with large portions finished or under construction,\" says the site.\nThe Trump campaign states that 216 miles have been completed, \"with an additional 339 miles under construction and 183 miles under pre-construction.\" It is not clear what \"pre-construction\" is.\nBut what we do know is that most of that was a replacement wall. As of May 2020, only three miles has been built on fresh ground, The Washington Post reported.\nFor you\nFor you",

Cohen\nJanuary 8, 2019\nThis commentary originally appeared in the opinion section of FoxNews.com.\nWashington is literally at a standstill over the funding for a wall on the United States southern border. Putting aside the politics behind the gridlock for the moment, the substance of the debate hinges less on the need for border security and more on differing claims about the effectiveness of such a wall. President Trump has claimed a wall would be “99.9 percent” effective at stopping illegal immigration while leading Democrats argue a border wall is unnecessary and would be “ineffective.” And so it may be worth stepping back from the politics of the day to view walls in their historical context. After all, states have been building walls since ancient times. Some were arguably quite successful, others less so. At the core of prudent policy lies a basic question: What can walls realistically accomplish?\nHistorically, walls were used to keep invaders out. The early Chinese states built what has become known as the Great Wall to protect themselves against the nomadic groups of the Steppes. Roman Emperor Hadrian constructed a wall across the British isle separating the Roman domain from troublesome northern tribes. More recently, Israel has employed several walls along the West Bank and Gaza, as well as along its northern and southern borders, to protect itself from terrorism, smuggling, illegal immigration and other threats.\nAuthoritarian regimes have used walls to keep their populations in. During the Cold War, the communist German Democratic Republic constructed the Berlin Wall to separate East Berlin from West Berlin at least as much to keep their own residents in as their Western foes out. The same may be true of the barriers along the Demilitarized Zone on the Korean Peninsula, which, in addition to its military function, serves to keep North Koreans from defecting.\nMore recently, walls have been used to keep warring populations separated. Walls have long been a staple of counterinsurgency (PDF). During the Troubles in Northern Ireland, the British emplaced the so-called “peace walls” in Belfast to separate Republican Catholic neighborhoods from Loyalist Protestant ones in an effort to tamp down sectarian violence. Similarly, during the Iraq War, the United States military relied extensively on giant concrete barrier walls both to combat the improvised explosive device threat and later to help isolate sectarian hot spots, making concrete barriers one of the unsung heroes of the so-called Surge.\nNo matter their original purpose, some basic principles behind walls remain timeless. Walls do work, at least for a time. There is a reason, after all, why states across the centuries have turned to walls as solutions to strategic quagmires. As mentioned before, walls have proven notably effective in places like Iraq in tamping down violence. That said, walls also have a shelf-life. In military parlance, walls are delaying obstacles. They can slow down the attacker and in best-case scenarios deter them from attacking in the first place by making the effort not worth the reward. But no historical wall has proven impregnable. Determined adversaries have been able to breach them or tunnel under them in time. Despite Israel's technological edge, Hamas has infiltrated under the walls around Gaza. North Korea was able to tunnel into the demilitarized zone toward South Korea, despite it being one of the most fortified areas of the world.\nPartly because walls are only a delaying obstacle, building them is only half the issue. After their construction, they need to be constantly monitored—often the harder task, even with advanced technology. In this sense, the Israeli effort around Gaza is particularly instructive. The Israeli-Gaza border after all is comparatively tiny, about 60 kilometers or less than a fiftieth the length of United States-Mexican border, and the Israelis still need to devote ample technological resources and manpower to watching it. And even so, these walls have not been foolproof.\nWalls sometimes can create new ethical dilemmas. Walls can become the focal point for conflict. A recent example of this occurred when Palestinians—some of them armed—protested near the Gaza wall for seven months beginning in March. While accounts vary, human rights groups place the number of casualties at over 5,800 injured and 180 killed. Even in less extreme cases, walls—especially in populated areas—may disrupt trade and the free flow of people, inflicting a cost on the local population.\nFinally, walls are a tactic (if, at times, a critical one), but ultimately, not a strategy. Because they can provide immediate relief to the problems at hand, walls can buy decisionmakers the time and political space they need for other instruments of power to work, and for those tools to prove decisive. In this sense, walls can enable victory, but rarely are the reason for it. The Troubles in Ireland came to an end through negotiation and ultimately through a diplomatic accord. The Surge reduced violence in Iraq partially by co-opting Sunni insurgents. And some Israeli policymakers attribute the relative peace in the West Bank compared to Gaza—despite both having walls—at least in part to the West Bank's continued economic growth.\nIf the United States does indeed build a wall along its southern border and then monitors it effectively, it may succeed in curbing illegal immigration, but it will not end it. Walls cannot prevent people from overstaying their visas or being smuggled in another way. And if history is any precedent, illegal immigrants may attempt to tunnel under the wall, go over it or breach it some other way.\nAs long as life in the United States offers potential migrants more opportunities and fewer perceived dangers than their home countries, illegal immigration will likely persist.\nIf a border wall provides the political space for addressing these more systemic problems, then it may still be a worthwhile investment. That said, the proposed wall on the U.S.-Mexico border—like all previous walls—should be viewed as a means to an end, rather than an end unto itself.\nA former active duty Army officer and Iraq War veteran, Raphael S. Cohen is a political scientist at the nonprofit, nonpartisan RAND Corporation and an adjunct professor of security studies at Georgetown University. He is the lead author of “From Cast Lead to Protective Edge: Lessons from Israel's Wars in Gaza” and has elsewhere written about the use of walls in counterinsurgency.\nThis commentary originally appeared on Fox News Channel on January 8, 2019.

            "report_content": "Remarks\nImmigration\nIssued on:\nJanuary 12, 2021\n2:10 P.M. CST\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  Thank you, everybody.  Great honor to be here.  We worked long and hard.  Please sit down.  We’ve worked long and hard to get this done.  They said it couldn’t be done, and we got it done.  One of the largest infrastructure projects in the history of our country.\nI’m honored to be here in the Rio Grande Valley with the courageous men and women of Customs and Border Patrol.  These people are incredible.  They’re really incredible.  I’ve gotten to know you very well over the last four years.  Many of you are friends from all of the work we did in designing the wall.  We got it exactly as you wanted it — everything — including your protective plate on top.  I’d say, “Why did we put that?”  And they said, “We need it for extra protection.”  Climb plate.  And we have everything you want.  It’s steel.  It’s concrete inside the steel.  And then it’s rebar — a lot of heavy rebar inside the concrete.  And it’s as strong as you’re going to get and strong as you can have.  But we gave you 100 percent of what you wanted.  So now you have no excuses.  I didn’t want you to have any excuses.  (Laughter.)\nAnd you set records.  And we can’t let the next administration even think about taking it down, if you can believe that.  I don’t think that will happen.  I think when you see what it does and how it’s so important for our country, nobody is going to be touching it.  And you are very proud of it, and you’re proud of the work you did, because we really designed it together.\nWe’re joined together to celebrate a great achievement: the extraordinarily successful building of the wall on the southern border.\nBefore we begin, I’d like to say that free speech is under assault like never before.  The 25th Amendment is of zero risk to me but will come back to haunt Joe Biden and the Biden administration.  As the expression goes: Be careful what you wish for.  The impeachment hoax is a continuation of the greatest and most vicious witch hunt in the history of our country, and it is causing tremendous anger and division and pain — far greater than most people will ever understand, which is very dangerous for the USA, especially at this very tender time.\nAnd now I’d like to briefly address the events of last week.  Millions of our citizens watched on Wednesday as a mob stormed the Capitol and trashed the halls of government.  As I have consistently said throughout my administration, we believe in respecting America’s history and traditions, not tearing them down.  We believe in the rule of law, not in violence or rioting.\nBecause of the pandemic — horrible, horrible invisible enemy — and despite our tremendous success developing a vaccine years before it was thought evenly remotely possible.  Nobody thought it was going to be possible.  They said would take five years.  “Sir, it will take seven years.”  All of our scientists were saying — our advisors, “It will take 7 years, 5 years, 10 years maybe.”  Well, we did it just like I said we would.  And we had it out years and years before they thought it was possible.  And we’re now delivering it to states, including your state, where your governor and government are doing a terrific job in getting it administered in Texas.  And Florida is doing great.  Some of them are doing great.  Some aren’t doing as well, but they have all they can handle.  And we get it to them as fast as they need it, and even faster.\nBut they’re calling it a “medical miracle.”  And this has been a difficult year and a very difficult election.  The pandemic has made it a very, very difficult year for our country and virtually every country all over the world.\nNow is the time for our nation to heal, and it’s time for peace and for calm.  Respect for law enforcement and the great people within law enforcement — so many are here — is the foundation of the MAGA agenda.  And we’re a nation of law, and we’re a nation of order.  That is why we’re here today, to talk about what we must do to uphold the rule of law in America and how we must continue to support our law enforcement heroes, which is exactly what you are.  Do you feel like a hero?  Yeah, I think you do.  Right?  (Applause.)  You do and you are.\nI want to thank Customs and Border Patrol Commissioner Mark Morgan, who’s been incredible.  Where is Mark?  Mark?  Stand up, Mark.  Great job.  Fantastic.  (Applause.)\nChief Patrol Agent Brian Hastings.  Brian, thank you very much.  Great job.  (Applause.)  He’s so happy with it.  He said, “Sir, this really works.”\nAnd most importantly, the brave law enforcement officers who risk their lives every day to protect our families and our country.\nI also want to thank a tremendous gentleman, a friend of mine, Tom Homan.  He’s a great American patriot, and he was with us right from the beginning.  (Applause.)  Right, Tom?  You knew exactly — he said, “We need a wall,” when they were saying, “No, no, we need drones.  We need drones.”  I said, “Why?  So you can watch the people pour into our country illegally?”  And I want to thank you very much, Tom.  What a — what a professional job you’ve done.\nAll of you people, incredible.  Everyone here today is part of an incredible success story.  This is a real success story.\nWhen I took office, we inherited a broken, dysfunctional, and open border.  Everybody was pouring in at will.\nWorking alongside the heroes in this great outdoor space, looking at our wall, we reformed our immigration system and achieved the most secure southern border in U.S. history.  It is at a level that it’s never been before.\nWe took on the cartels, the coyotes, and the special interests, and we restored the rule of law.  For years, politicians ran for office promising to secure the border, only to get elected and to do the absolute exact opposite.  They even promised a wall.  If you remember, about 10 years ago, they promised a wall but they couldn’t get it built.  It wasn’t easy getting it built.  Getting it financed was tough.  Getting it built was even tougher.  All the different chains of title and all the different things we had to go through — very, very complex and very difficult, but we got it done.  But they had it years ago.  You remember that better than anybody.  Right?  And they never got it done.  They never, ever completed the task.  And then, ultimately, the money was sent back to the federal government.  Spent, but no wall was built.\nBut unlike those who came before me, I kept my promises.  And today we celebrate an extraordinary milestone: the completion of the promised 450 miles of border wall.  Four hundred and fifty miles.  Nobody realizes how big that is.  (Applause.)\nI remember when I first came down, about a year and a half ago: We’re under construction, and I started walking, and I’m looking at the wall, and I’m walking and walking.  And I’m used to, like, a development project where you could walk a wall.  You know, 10 acres, 5 acres, 2 acres, 1 acre.  Then I realized that’s a long time; that’s a big walk.  A lot of it — a lot of the wall you have is incredibly natural.  It’s — you have the mountains.  You have the rivers.  You have some very powerful water areas.  You have some areas that are virtually impossible to get by.  So we didn’t need walls everywhere, but where we needed them — because it’s been so successful that we’ve added nearly 300 miles.  And that’s currently under construction.  This was our original wish: to get these areas done where it was such trouble.  And now we have it.  It’s either in construction or pre-construction — an additional 300 miles.\nIn every region that we’ve built the wall, illegal crossings and drug smuggling have plummeted.  Absolutely plummeted.  In the Rio Grande Valley, crossings have dropped nearly 80 percent.  In Yuma, Arizona, illegal entries have been slashed by 90 percent.  Nationwide, ICE and Border Patrol have seized over 2 million pounds of fentanyl, heroin, meth, and other deadly narcotics, saving thousands and thousands of lives.\nWe’ve arrested nearly 500,000 illegal aliens with criminal records — some with very serious criminal records of the type you don’t want to know about, like murder.\nWe removed nearly 20,000 gang members from the United States, including 4,500 members of MS-13 — probably the worst gang of them all.  Through the landmark reforms we’ve put into place, we have ended the immigration chaos and reestablished American sovereignty.  Our most important reform was ending catch and release — not easy to do; you’re dealing with Congress; it’s very, very difficult — which is the functional equivalent of open borders, but even worse: It’s catch and release them.  It means release into our country, not into another country.\nThis policy was exploited by vicious criminal organizations, who understood the laws better than our people understood them for years, to spread misery and suffering and drugs all across the hemisphere.\nNow, instead of “catch and release,” we have “detain and remove.”  It’s called “detain and remove.”  Doesn’t that sound better?  One of the biggest loopholes we closed was asylum fraud.  Under the old, broken system, if you merely requested asylum, you were released into the country.  The most ridiculous thing anyone has ever seen.  And we were taking in some people that you didn’t want to have in your country.\nWe instituted a series of historic policy changes to shut down asylum fraud, and that’s what we did.  This includes the groundbreaking agreement with Mexico known as the “Migrant Protection Protocols,” or MPP.\nUnder this agreement, if an illegal alien requests asylum, they have to wait in Mexico until their case is heard.  They used to wait here.  And when they were waiting, they would say “bye-bye,” and they’d disappear somewhere into our country, and essentially we’d never find them again, would never see them again.\nThis one measure alone ended a humanitarian crisis and saved countless lives, and especially, I have to say, lives from crime.\nI want to thank the great President of Mexico.  He is a great gentleman, a friend of mine.  And President Obrador — he is a man who really knows what’s happening.  And he loves his country, and he also loves the United States.  But I want to thank for his friendship and his professional working relationship.\nWe actually had 27,000 Mexican soldiers guarding our borders over the last two years.  Nobody thought that was possible.  And they made it very, very difficult, and that’s why the numbers were able to plunge, even during the construction of the wall.\nAnd, by the way, one of the big elements of the wall that make it so successful is we can have far fewer people working.  Now, they can be working on other things — other things related to crime and drug prevention and a lot of other elements they’re working on, because we saved massive numbers of people.  And included here we have the most sophisticated camera systems and most sophisticated electronic systems anywhere in the world.\nWe implemented three historic agreements with the Northern Triangle; that’s Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador.  Under these critical asylum cooperation agreements, the burden of illegal immigration is now shared all across the region.  Now, when an illegal immigrant is arrested at our border, they can be sent to a neighboring country instead of into a U.S. community.\nPrior to my getting here, countries wouldn’t accept them.  They would say, “No, no, no.”  I said, “Well, you got to take them.”  First month — I’ll never forget — these gentlemen, right here, came to me.  They said, “They won’t take them back.”\nThey came.  They may be murderers.  They may be cartel heads.  They may be some really vicious people.  The countries didn’t want them back.  And I stopped all payments to those countries.  I stopped everything going to those countries.  And after it was stopped for about a month — you remember? — after it was stopped for about a month, they called.  They said, “We’d love to have them back.”  And I never gave them as much money as they were getting, by the way, but they got some.  (Applause.) It was amazing.\nAnd you people know better than anyone: They wouldn’t take them back.  We’d have planes flying over, loaded up with people that we didn’t want here.  And they’d say, “Don’t ever even think about landing that plane.”  And they’d take them by boat, and they’d take them by bus, and they wouldn’t let them into their countries.  And all of a sudden, they say, “Welcome back.  We love having you.”\nSo it was a great thing.  And now they do take them back.  And the relationship with those countries — the Triangle — the relationship is a much better one than it was before.\nIn addition to our agreements with Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador, we have systematically reformed the regulatory code to return asylum to its original legal meaning and purpose — not a free ticket for entry.\nA recent comprehensive report by the Department of Homeland Security and Justice show how effective our reforms have been and how disastrous their removal would be.  It would be a disaster for our country.  I know they’re thinking about removing them.  I hope they don’t do that.  I hope they don’t do that.  It’ll be a absolute travesty for our country.\nThe report conclusively proves, once and for all, that aliens released at the border remain at large in the country and do not return home.  They won’t go home.  And you rarely find them.  It’s very tough to find them.\nSo we have aliens released in our country, many of whom are serious criminals.  And we’ve stopped that.  Don’t ever start that process again.  By contrast, under our policies, 98 percent of aliens that remain in DHS custody are removed.  Simply put, if you enter the United States illegally, you are apprehended and immediately safely removed from our country.  Without this core principle, there is no border, there is no law, there is no order.\nMy administration also instituted vital public health measures on the border.  In response to the China virus, under Title 42 of the U.S. Code, illegal immigrants are being promptly removed to protect the health of border agents, other migrants, and local communities, and the public at large.  Removing these protections would invite a public health catastrophe of epic proportions.\nAs you probably know, in Tijuana, various parts of Mexico, the COVID — it’s got about 24 names I can call it, from “COVID” to “China virus.”  I can call it the “plague.”  I call it the “China plague.”  A lot of different names.  But we always call it the “invisible enemy.”  But the invisible enemy has been very tough on Mexico, and we have areas along the border where we’re in great shape because right there, because of that, that we’re in great shape.  But on the other side, in Mexico, they’re suffering greatly with the virus.  It’s been incredible what we’ve achieved.  And we didn’t do the wall because of COVID; we did the wall because of security and drugs and other things.  But it turned out that, in the middle of it all, along came this horrible plague.\nWe inherited a dangerously lawless border.  The people that work here are unbelievably brave.  I’ve seen what they have to endure, what they have to go through.  They’re tough, they’re strong, and they’re great patriots, great Americans.\nWe fixed it and we secured it.  We empowered our wonderful ICE and Border Patrol to fulfill their oaths and sworn officers.  They became sworn officers of the law.  And they love their job.  It’s a tough job.  It’s a nasty job.  They’re not paid what they should be paid, to be honest, but we got you up.  We got you up.  But these are incredibly talented people that could probably do a lot better, in terms of economics, than they do here.  But they love what they do, and they love their country.\nWe also put into place vital measures to protect American workers, keep out terrorists, and stop the abuse of our welfare system — where they’d come up, go on our welfare system, and live for years on American welfare without ever having a job.\nWe also have, and we had — but we have them all the time — we have terrorists from the Middle East coming into our country through the southern border.  That was before what you see right here, because it was easier to come into our country through the southern border than it was through airports or any other means.  So they’d land in South America, and they’d work their way up, and they’d come into our country.  And these are not people from the countries that you would suspect.  These are people from some very seriously dangerous places in the Middle East.  And the numbers are far greater than anybody would understand.  Really far greater.\nRemoving any of these measures would hamstring our workers, endanger our country, and cost taxpayers hundreds of billions of dollars a year.\nNo matter our party, we should all agree on the need to protect our workers, our families, and our citizens of all backgrounds, no matter who they are.  In particular, if our border security measures are reversed, it will trigger a tidal wave of illegal immigration — a wave like you’ve never seen before.  And I can tell you that, already, waves are starting to come up from 2,000 and 1,000 and 500 miles away.  We see what’s coming.\nAnd they’re coming because they think that it’s gravy train at the end; it’s going to be a gravy train.  Change the name from the “caravans,” which I think we came up with, to the “gravy train,” because that’s what they’re looking for — looking for the gravy.\nThis will be an unmitigated calamity for national security, public safety, and public health.  It would destroy millions and millions of jobs and claim thousands of innocent lives.  The policies I put into place are uniformly and strongly supported by the men and women of ICE and Border Patrol.  We worked on them together, just like we did on the wall.  We worked on the policies together because nobody knows this whole world better than the incredible people right in front of me.  To terminate those policies is knowingly to put America in really serious danger and to override the great career experts that have worked so hard — those from DHS.\nAt this very moment, smugglers and coyotes are preparing to surge the border if our policies are loosened or removed.  I mean, they’re literally waiting — big, big groups of people.  Some of them very unsavory, I might add.\nThis is an entirely preventable tragedy.  It’s waiting to happen.  The safety of our nation must come before politics.  We have many disagreements in the country, but we should all agree: the urgent need to secure our borders, protect our homeland, and allow law enforcement to fulfill its mission without political interference.\nICE and Border Patrol agents swore a sacred oath to uphold the law, and no political appointee should ever order them to violate that oath.  These are real experts.  They really get it.\nAnd I’ll tell you who else gets it: The Hispanic population of our country gets it.  Because not only did I win Texas in historic numbers, but I won border towns, which are largely Hispanic, and people were amazed to see that.  And the numbers, they say, were — the Governor of Texas called — Greg — great guy, great governor — called.  He said, “You had numbers that nobody has had since Reconstruction.  “Reconstruction” means “Civil War.”  And largely Hispanic.  They understand it better than anybody, and they want law enforcement to help them — help them live safe lives.\nThe laws that Congress passed must be upheld.  To the men and women of ICE, Customs and Border Protection, and all across DHS, law enforcement in general: You have earned the everlasting gratitude of our nation.  You have no idea how much our nation loves you and respects you.  I don’t think you do have an idea, but it’s true.  I only hope and pray that your voice will be heard, honored, heeded, and respected long into the future.\nGod bless you.  God bless law enforcement.  And God bless America.  Thank you very much.  Thank you.  Great job.  (Applause.)",

            "report_content": "What it would take for Trump’s signature promise to become reality\nDonald Trump promised the American people he would build a “big, beautiful wall” along the US-Mexico border. At campaign rallies, it became a call and response. In a lot of ways, it became a joke. To some, it became a taunt at high school basketball games, a way to make clear some kinds of people aren’t welcome here. Most of all, the wall was easily the most identifiable campaign promise of any candidate in the 2016 election cycle — maybe of any candidate in a generation.\nNow that Trump is president, that promise is coming due.\nThe Trump administration now wants to see the wall built. They are absolutely serious about it. Even though it lost the first round of the funding battle in Congress, when legislators refused to give the administration billions of dollars over the summer, it’s requesting $1.6 billion in wall funding in the 2018 budget. And the Department of Homeland Security is reviewing proposals to build prototypes — 30-foot-long segments at least 18 feet high — somewhere around San Diego.\nHow far the wall goes from symbol to reality is anyone’s guess. There are a ton of obstacles in the way: physical, legal, financial, operational. And at every step, the Trump administration will have to plot a path between the symbolic fantasy of the wall and the small, mundane, human realities of the people living on the border.\nBefore he was elected, Trump liked to say that the US practically “doesn’t have a border.” Unsurprisingly, he was not exactly telling the truth.\nAccording to the Government Accountability Office, there are 651.7 miles of fencing along the US-Mexico border. The first fencing was built in the 1990s, along the westernmost sector of the border (known as the San Diego Sector). But the current fencing regime is largely the product of the 2006 Secure Fence Act, which passed with overwhelming bipartisan support (backed by then-Sen. Hillary Clinton and Sen. Chuck Schumer) and which required 650 miles of fencing along certain areas of the border.\nThere’s some evidence that fencing has been effective — or, at least, that it’s been part of a broader strategy of bulking up border security that’s been effective.\nThe government estimates how many people are crossing the US-Mexico border by looking at how many are caught — and by that measure, the flow of unauthorized people into the US in 2016 was one-quarter  of what it was in 2000.\nIn the San Diego sector, in particular — where the border cuts through an urban area and it might be easy for people to slip by unnoticed — stepped-up enforcement in the 1990s led to more apprehensions at first (as more people got caught), and then fewer apprehensions as people stopped trying.\nThe question is whether it’s enough.\nSecuring the border has historically been a policy argument, about what types of fencing are most effective, most cost-effective, and most helpful to Border Patrol agents.\nEven before Trump, there was a years-long legislative debate about whether it’s the right kind of fencing. It hasn’t been an argument about politics or symbolism. Until now.\nThe Secure Fence Act originally specified double-layer fencing, which is more expensive to build but also much harder to cut and cross through. Today, a fraction of the 650 miles of fencing count as “double layer.”\nLess than half of the existing fencing is thick enough to prevent pedestrians from crossing (the rest is “vehicle fencing” that can’t be driven through but can be navigated on foot). And even “pedestrian fencing” isn’t always effective: The lowest apprehension rate along the entire US-Mexico border, where only an estimated 17 percent of border crossers are caught, is the sections of the El Paso sector that are “completely covered” by pedestrian fencing built in the past 10 years.\nWhen George W. Bush’s Department of Homeland Security said that double fencing wasn’t feasible for large swaths of the southern border, the Secure Fence Act was amended in 2007 to give the government more authority to determine what counted as a sufficient fence. To many Republicans, though, that seemed like a cop-out, and they’ve spent years accusing the government of not having finished the job right.\nRegardless of how wildly inaccurate Donald Trump was about the state of border security, a lot of people believe he’s correct — including the core supporters who made him a force to be reckoned with in the 2016 Republican presidential primary. Those voters are either unaware that there’s currently a fence or simply don’t believe a fence is enough. They want something absolutely foolproof and impregnable, or at least a symbol against attack.\nThe Trump administration is already struggling to reconcile its wild promises of a “big, beautiful wall” with the existing policy reality. When DHS asked for wall prototypes, it initially specified that the wall had to be concrete, which would have been extremely unlikely to fly with Border Patrol agents, who prefer something they can see through — then hastily added a separate request for non-concrete “alternative” materials.\nWhite House press secretary Sean Spicer bragged that the funding bill passed by Congress in May will allow the government to build fencing — and got into an argument with a Breitbart reporter during a press briefing when the reporter pointed out those fences weren’t a wall.\nBuilding a concrete wall — something that no one within government has asked for — would be more symbolic than practical. But simply building more fencing, and calling it a “wall,” would be, in a significant way, cheating.\nNot even a little bit.\nAs Sen. Heidi Heitkamp (D-ND) said during a Senate hearing on border security, “There has been no one that has come before this body suggesting that we need to build a concrete wall across the border — no one. Not one person, no matter what political persuasion.”\nSelling the wall in Congress will be tough, in other words. But that’s nothing compared to the practical realities of trying to actually build it.\nFor one thing, you have the Rio Grande, which defines the easternmost 1,164 miles of the border. There’s some fencing (if only a little) in each of the four border “sectors” along the Rio Grande; much of it is set back from the river, forcing people to turn back after entering US territory instead of preventing their entry to begin with.\nIt’s not enough to prevent people from crossing — more than half of all unauthorized entries from 2013 to 2015 happened in the four easternmost Border Patrol sectors, all of which are entirely on the Rio Grande. But it makes fencing construction tricky.\nBut the real problem is the canyons.\n“If you look out in Big Bend,” says Chris Cabrera, deputy spokesperson for the National Border Patrol Council, the union representing US Border Patrol agents, “you have huge drop-offs, huge cliffs. It would be very difficult to build a wall over there, especially when you’re looking at about a 40-, 50-foot drop from ground level to the river.”\nCabrera — and everyone else — sees border security as a three-pronged effort: infrastructure, which includes barriers to keep people from crossing; surveillance, to inform agents when people are crossing; and personnel, to catch people trying to cross.\nThere’s no magic ratio of the three that makes for ideal security; given the astounding variety of terrain along the border, and the variety of uses to which humans have put its land, what’s most needed depends on where it’s going to be placed.\nBarriers are most important “where you have a city that’s right up against the border,” explains National Border Patrol Council spokesperson Shawn Moran. Smuggling organizations tend to have “infrastructure and support” in urban areas — and people crossing on their own have an easy time blending into the crowd.\nCabrera says that in the Rio Grande Valley, “we have areas where it’s a less than 10-second run from the river to an urban area, where it’s built up and they can hide. That’s a very difficult place to patrol because of the timing; you have to be right on top of it when they cross.”\nThis is why the San Diego area was the first part of the border to get fenced, and why fencing has been most effective there and (to a lesser extent) in El Paso.\nUsing fencing strategically means not putting it places where it won’t be effective — but instead pushing people toward unfenced parts of the border that are either harder to cross or easier to patrol. Agents call this “funneling”; the wall, Cabrera hopes, will “funnel them, or slow them down, into areas where we can apprehend them a little easier.”\nAt Big Bend, for example, the same cliffs that make building a wall so daunting give agents a huge advantage on patrol. “When you have a 40-, 50-foot cliff,” Cabrera says, “you can rest assured it’s going to be difficult to scale that thing unnoticed.” When fences started going up in California, immigrants turned to the Arizona desert instead — which was harder to cross unmolested because it was simply harder to cross. It was deadlier (hundreds of immigrants died every year), but it made those who survived easier to spot and catch.\nFunneling isn’t a foolproof strategy. People can still cross in fenced areas, and no one thinks you can design a perfect enough funneling system that agents will catch everyone coming through the funnel’s mouth. To people like Cabrera and Moran, the point of building a wall (however it’s defined) is to improve on the existing funneling, and make it as effective as possible. But to people who are looking for something rock solid and symbolic, that might not help either.\nThe easy — or at least seemingly easy — way to get around the question of when a barrier counts as a wall: define a wall as something else entirely.\nSome Republicans in Congress, like Lindsey Graham, are already doing this: saying the wall will be built but it will be a “virtual wall,” based on surveillance rather than physical prevention.\nThis might sound innovative. It’s not. It’s something the government has been trying to do for decades.\nBefore Republicans tried to pivot to a “virtual wall,” the Bush and Obama administrations tried to pivot from the Secure Fence Act to a “virtual fence.” Over the past two decades, there have been no fewer than four separate government initiatives to fix the border using surveillance technology — from a sensors-and-cameras initiative in 1998 to Obama-era experiments with surveillance drones.\nAll four initiatives were either totally abandoned or quietly considered failures. Very expensive failures.\nThe problem is that the government has never bothered to lay out, in advance, what goals the new technology was supposed to meet — and how, exactly, it would fit in with the infrastructure and personnel in a realistic border security strategy.\nThe biggest effort — the SBInet program — was launched in 2006 to use technology to create a “virtual fence.” SBInet was supposed to cover 387 miles of the US border by the end of 2008.\n“They couldn’t manage to do it right,” analyst Tom Barry of the TransBorder Project told Homeland Security Newswire in 2010, “because they were in such a hurry to show the American public that the government was fulfilling its responsibility to secure the border and they didn’t do the adequate preparation.”\nDHS never bothered to complete a program evaluation to determine how SBInet would contribute to the broader goal of securing the border. Nor did it oversee contractors to prevent cost overruns and delays — or even, one Government Accountability Office audit found, make sure contractors had completed early steps before moving on to later ones.\nBy 2011, when it was formally canceled, SBInet had been deployed across 53 miles — not quite 14 percent of the area it was supposed to cover. It had cost more than $1 billion.\nOne might hope that after the SBInet debacle, the Department of Homeland Security has learned its lesson about more careful contractor oversight. But it doesn’t appear to have learned its lesson about asking how a project fits into an actual strategy before moving forward with construction based on “dreams, hopes and fantasy,” as Barry described SBInet.\nIn other words, the Trump administration can’t use the “virtual wall” label to solve its fundamental dilemma: Should it make incremental improvements based on realistic goals, or do something symbolic and sweeping?\nThe real answer is nobody knows exactly — mostly because there isn’t a concrete idea of what the “wall” will actually look like.\nWhat’s become increasingly clear is that whatever the wall is, it will be expensive.\nEstimates so far have put the price tag anywhere from a low of $12 billion, which was floated by the Trump administration, to $15 billion estimated by House and Senate Leadership to even $21.6 billion, the highest estimated cost in a proposal seen by the Department of Homeland Security — which would be about half DHS’s yearly budget. A recent report put together by Democrats on the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs estimated an even higher price tag for the wall and patrolling technology, at a whopping $70 billion — more than four times Trump’s initial figure.\nThe Democrats’ figure isn’t that unrealistic, either. At the time the Secure Fence Act was passed, Congress estimated the whole project would cost roughly $50 billion over the course of 25 years, which makes Trump’s estimates look especially low, given the fights he is going to have on the ground — particularly in South Texas.\nSo far, the Trump administration’s supplemental budget request to Congress, requesting $3 billion to begin building the wall, hire border and Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents, and expand detention and deportation programs, failed to make it into the 2017 spending bill. The Democrats successfully blocked all wall funding in the government shutdown negotiations — at least until September.\nBut wall construction still isn’t at a total standstill. Funding for pending government contracts for wall prototypes is untouched — those contracts were funded through the 2016 budget. Paying for a preliminary model of the wall would likely give more clarity to how much the actual wall would cost.\nTrump has turned his eye toward the 2018 budget proposal, which has an additional $2.6 billion for wall construction. To be clear, this would still only be a fraction of the border wall’s estimated cost. And there is a good chance construction will run up the bill once on the ground.\nTake McAllen, Texas, a border town on the Rio Grande whose mayor, Jim Darling, has been advocating for levees instead of a wall — an ask city leaders along the more than 1,000 miles of river have made since the Secure Fence Act’s passage. The idea is that levees would help mitigate flooding and provide added security. But prioritizing these demands would be much more expensive than building a typical barrier in Yuma, Arizona, as David Aguilar, a former deputy commissioner of US Customs and Border Protection, admitted in a Senate hearing on the wall.\n“You have to decide where you are going to put your resources,” said David Danelo, a national security expert with the Foreign Policy Research Center who has traveled the border extensively. “It’s going to be ugly. There’s going to be cost overruns when it comes to South Texas.”\nThe other thing that everyone knows about Trump’s wall is that he will “make Mexico pay for it.” That promise seems even more unrealistic than the wall itself.\nThe Trump administration’s current plan appears to say Trump never promised he’d make Mexico pay for the wall before it was built and to steam ahead, presumably figuring out how to get Mexico to pay at a later date.\nThe Mexican government certainly won’t write out an oversize charity-style check to the Trump administration for billions of dollars to pay for the wall. But there are a couple of policies the US could push to raise revenue on the backs of Mexico — or Mexicans, or Mexican Americans.\nThe most prominent idea floated on this front is the border adjustment tax. The proposal would tax Mexican imports and exempt exports (Vox’s Dylan Matthews explains this in greater detail), which counts as raising money because the US currently imports more than it exports. If that remained the case, the revenue raised would far outstrip the cost of the wall. The idea is well-liked by leading House Republicans like Speaker Paul Ryan and Rep. Kevin Brady, who chairs the House’s tax-focused Ways and Means Committee.\nBut the border adjustment tax was not included in Trump’s one-page tax reform blueprint to Congress. And confusingly, Trump has both said he is interested in a “border adjustment” tax and rejected the idea of what a “border adjustment” tax actually is. Members of the House Freedom Caucus — the conservative faction of the party that successfully moved the Republican health care plan to the right — have already expressed a lot of skepticism about the idea.\n“You are adding a whole new tax and revenue stream on the economy and not getting rid of another one — that is always dangerous because it is just one more tax that could go up over time,” Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH), a founding member of the Freedom Caucus, said. “From a purely philosophical standpoint, I think this is problematic.”\nOther solutions floated by Trump during the presidential campaign could be even more aggressive — like taxing remittances sent by people in the US to Mexico, or even confiscating them (a move of extremely dubious legality).\nAll of these proposals assume that the US is in a position of strength with Mexico — that it holds all the cards and Mexico will be willing (or forced) to go along with whatever decision it makes. But if the Trump administration moves forward on building a wall, talking payment will be the least of its problems with Mexico — and it’s going to find the country less, not more, willing to go along with anything else America wants.\nArturo Sarukhán, former Mexican ambassador to the US, points out that “Mexico and the US ... have been working hand in hand since 9/11” to protect the border from terrorism and crime. “Post-9/11, we understood that if there was a perception that a terrorist threat had materialized across the border in Mexico, the trade relationship that we had been building since 1993, when NAFTA was approved, would collapse.”\nMuch of the border security efforts over the past 20 years — especially when it comes to the organized criminal networks that would theoretically become a bigger problem once the wall is built — has been done with the cooperation of the Mexican government. In some cases, that’s been undermined by corruption, but often the Mexican government has been successful in intercepting problems before they become the US’s problems.\nMexico, for example, has taken an active role in intercepting Central American children and families journeying to the US — “at a very steep domestic and moral cost for Mexico, because this issue is criticized profoundly across Mexican society,” Sarukhán points out. Mexico shares flight manifests for all flights in Mexican airspace with the US, so that it can catch anyone on the US’s terrorism watch list. American law enforcement agents are allowed to conduct operations on Mexican soil.\nBuilding a wall would be hard to interpret as anything other than a slap in the face to everything Mexico has done for the US over the past 20 years — “the meaning of this is really to separate Mexico,” says Rafael Fernández de Castro, who served in the government of former Mexican President Felipe Calderón. And it might, Sarukhán says, cause Mexico to review — and possibly reconsider — some of its support for the US’s security needs.\n“If the wall becomes an issue which contaminates the bilateral agenda as a whole, then it can start having an impact on lots of other things,” says Sarukhán. The wall isn’t supposed to impede trade flows — $1.4 billion in goods flow between the two countries, legally, through ports of entry — but, as Fernández points out, its symbolism undermines Mexico’s decision “to embrace the United States as an economic partner and to try to create a North American economic community” with NAFTA.\n“Over the past two decades,” Sarukhán says, the Mexican public “slowly jettisoned its anti-Americanism, and its historical suspicion of the relationship with the US. You’re seeing some of that creeping back into the fabric of Mexican society. You’ve seen some significant calls to boycott US companies, US products, US brands.” And the election of Trump has often been cited as a reason why the left-populist Andrés Manuel López Obrador — who’s promised to take a more antagonistic stance toward the US — is leading in presidential polls.\nSay Trump gets the money, and he somehow figures out a way to build a wall through rivers, canyons, and jungles. He still will have a big problem on his hands: American landowners.\nTo build the wall, federal officials will have to take a sizable chunk of private land on the southern border away from American citizens, many of whom have owned rights to the land for centuries. Make no mistake, this process would be incredibly time-consuming and expensive for the federal government, and a point of contention with American voters.\n“This is a battle,” Rep. Henry Cuellar (D-TX), whose district covers 280 miles of the border, told the Los Angeles Times. “In Texas, we have a long tradition of private property rights. Any time big government starts using eminent domain and taking land — especially the valuable part, access to water — then it becomes a battle cry. Lawsuits will definitely be coming in.”\nTake Mauricio Vidaurri, one of Cuellar’s constituents, whose family has owned 1,300 acres of land just 20 miles south of Laredo, Texas, since 1750. Vidaurri is a rancher and an inspector with Customs and Border Protection, and his land extends to the river, where Trump’s wall would be built.\nHe has some practical concerns; he relies on the water from the river to grow hay on his ranch. Would the wall cut him off from his water source?\nThen there’s sentiment. The wall could cut off his family’s nearly 200-year-old cemetery, where his great-grandfather, grandfather, and father, a World War II veteran, are buried. Vidaurri’s situation poses what will likely be one of the biggest challenges for the Trump administration on the road ahead.\nThe federal government has the legal power to take private land through eminent domain, if it compensates the landowners for the property. But landowners also have the right to due process, which in the past has tied up the government in courts for years.\nThis has happened before. After the Secure Fence Act’s passage, officials began the long process of buying off people’s lands, and hundreds of landowners fought back. There are still more than 90 cases tied up in court a decade later, according to Terence Garrett, a border security expert with the University of Texas Rio Grande. So far, the government has spent nearly $80 million to compensate landowners to build the existing fencing. The Chicago Tribune reported that Customs and Border Protection “estimates that it will spend an additional $21 million in real estate expenses associated with the remaining condemnation cases, not including about $4 million in Justice Department litigation costs.”\nGarrett was personally involved in one of these fights in 2007, when the University of Texas Rio Grande successfully stopped the federal government from building an 18-foot border fence through campus. Instead, it built a 10-foot fence separating campus from a next-door golf course. Another golf course nearby was able to stop building altogether, Garrett said, adding that working-class neighborhoods were notably less successful in winning eminent domain cases. Some offered sentimental and emotional appeals — like the university’s case that the wall would disrupt the bicultural, binational standing of the university. Others have said it would be bad for business.\nPut simply, government taking American citizens’ private land is not a popular idea — especially in Texas, where most of these battles will go down. Garrett predicts private landowners will be even more driven to fight against Trump’s wall.\n“The difference between this time and last time is that people know what happened last time,” he said.\nIn California and Arizona, the government already has the rights to most of the border land. But Arizona is also home to the sovereign territory of the Tohono O’odham Nation reservation, which has already come out against building the wall. If the government attempts to build the wall through the 75 miles of sovereign territory in Arizona, it won’t be anything short of a fight.\n“You would fundamentally have to change treaty arrangements with them,” said Roger McManus, who is on the board of directors of the Friends of the Sonoran Desert National Monument, a nonprofit that works with federal agencies to protect the natural and cultural resources in Arizona and California. “You would see something that would surpass the [Dakota Access] pipeline situation.”\nThen there are the environmental concerns. As Vox’s Eliza Barclay and Sarah Frostenson reported, “the 654 miles of walls and fences already on the US-Mexico border have made a mess out of the environment there.”\nWith fencing, Border Patrol has made some accommodations for migrating animals in the area — but depending on what this wall would look like, that might no longer be a workaround.\nSomehow, as “Build the wall!” became a way to taunt liberal college students and Latino basketball players, the idea of the wall as an actual policy got lost. Would the wall actually stop people from coming over the border without papers?\n“We can’t fool ourselves,” says former CBP Deputy Commissioner David Aguilar. “Is there something that is going to guarantee 100 percent that we’re going to seal the border? No, absolutely not.”\nIt will never be impossible for someone who wants to enter the US to do so if they have the time, resources, and determination. The purpose of border security is to set that bar as high as possible — which means some people will be more easily deterred than others.\nSome will simply go under, over, or even through the wall. The best advantage a wall has over a fence is that it’s harder to cut through; the Trump administration’s contract request requires wall prototypes to be able to resist 30 to 90 minutes of drilling with hand tools. But the parts of the border where fencing is most effective (the San Diego area) are also the ones where the government has discovered the most, and most sophisticated, tunnels.\nIn 2012, DHS reported that it had discovered 140 tunnels over the past two decades — increasing from about five or six per year before 2008 to nearly 10 per year afterward. Many of those tunnels were described as “sophisticated” systems with interlocking passageways and sometimes even lighting and flooring.\nThe San Diego fence didn’t necessarily cause smugglers to build tunnels instead, but it certainly wasn’t enough to prevent their construction. Furthermore, the very reason fencing is considered so helpful in San Diego — its urban density — made it easy for smugglers to build tunnels without detection: “The buildings on both sides of the border allow for the concealment of tunnel entry and exit points.”\nMeanwhile, there’s the threat of drug smuggling drones being piloted across the border. Less futuristic, but more common, is the use of ultralight aircraft to smuggle drug loads over the heads of Border Patrol agents (a trend that’s been simmering for several years). And even if a wall could stretch from sea to shining sea, committed smugglers and immigrants could get into boats or submarines.\nOr smugglers could just continue to do what many of them are doing anyway: cross the border “the right way” — at a port of entry — with contraband in tow.\nCustoms and Border Protection doesn’t make an effort to estimate how many drugs successfully enter the US — a spokesperson told Vox, “We can’t track what we don’t catch.” But no one believes that agents are catching all the drugs (or people) that smugglers bring into the country through ports of entry, in specially outfitted trucks or thanks to bribing patrol agents. The Drug Enforcement Administration’s 2016 drug threat report says that Mexican drug smuggling organizations, in particular, prefer to send their product into the US through ports — and that hard drugs are particularly likely to be flown into the US, smuggled in on commercial flights.\nThis doesn’t mean that a wall does nothing. It means the wall is more likely to block some kinds of illegal entries than others. Individuals trying to come to the United States for work or family might successfully be deterred from crossing; cartels aiming to make millions of dollars in cocaine revenue probably will not.\nIf Border Patrol agents are being freed up to track down and investigate these “sophisticated” criminal enterprises, because they no longer have to round up small groups of immigrants straggling through the desert, that could be one way to define success.\nChris Cabrera of the National Border Patrol Council says this is a strategy smugglers use now to distract border agents: “They know that Border Patrol agents are going to have to come in and apprehend these folks, sometimes 80 to 90 at a time, which is gonna deplete our lines, deplete our resources in the field. And once we pull out of other areas, they can bring across drugs or more high-value human cargo.” A wall would have something like the opposite effect: reducing the distractions of “low-value” immigrant targets and freeing up agents to catch higher-level criminal activity.\nThere is some evidence that previous border security buildups have succeeded in deterring such “low-value” targets from coming to the US over the past decade (though some scholars argue that the Great Recession played a bigger role). There’s even more evidence that it’s deterred people who were caught once from trying to cross a second time. But it’s not clear whether that’s an indication that the US could be even more effective with even more enforcement, or that the government has already picked the low-hanging fruit.\nAll things considered, there simply aren’t a lot of “low-value” immigrant targets still coming across the border. Certainly not compared with how many there were in 2000, or even in 2012. The people still coming to the US without papers are, increasingly, children and families from Central America trying to seek asylum — something that, legally speaking, they’re supposed to be able to do by presenting themselves at ports of entry. If the wall is built, they’re supposed to be able to meet someone at the door.\nThe most unrealistic expectation one could have of the wall is that it could reduce the number of unauthorized immigrants living in the US. Most of the immigrants who are here have been in the US for more than a decade. If anything, the border security buildup back in the 1990s encouraged them to settle in the US and send for family members.\nBuilding a wall now wouldn’t have the same sort of unintended consequences — for the simple reason that it’s already happened. People have already settled. The existing barriers have already changed the border from a place where people can cross back and forth to one that people, at risk of their lives, hope to have to try to cross only once.\nWhether you see further enforcement as a worthwhile endeavor depends pretty strongly on whether you see deterring unauthorized migration, in any form — and to any extent — as an important and good thing. If you think of unauthorized immigrants as collateral damage in a war on crime — and see human smuggling, for example, as the inevitable impact of making it harder to get to the US — the effect of a wall on criminal organizations won’t be enough to justify the effect on immigrants’ lives.\nBut if you think of unauthorized immigration as something that strengthens criminal activity — either because you think “illegal immigrants” are themselves inherently criminal or because you think the demand for human smuggling is driving the supply of smugglers — disrupting immigrants for the sake of hypothetically, slightly, temporarily disrupting criminal organizations is a win-win.\nThe question then is whether the effect it’s likely to have on disrupting unauthorized migration will be worth the money (and everything else) it costs to build it.\nThe wall is Trump’s most identifiable campaign promise. Of course, not all of his voters thought he would literally build a wall to keep that promise — some didn’t even want him to. Polls both before and after the election show that a border wall isn’t a terribly popular idea, even among some Republicans.\nOne poll conducted by the Pew Research Center, in particular, shows that Republicans living within 350 miles of the US-Mexico border — the people closest to the putative wall — were the least likely to support it.\nBut this isn’t about Trump’s voters. It’s about his base.\nResearch indicates that many Americans — particularly white Americans, and particularly a strain of white conservative Americans especially concerned about immigration — are worried about immigration less as a legal issue than as a cultural threat, especially when it comes to Latino immigrants (whom they associate with a different way of life and also, often, with crime). Furthermore, those Americans tend to conflate “illegal immigrants” with “immigrants” and “immigrants” with “Latinos” — leading them to overstate the number of unauthorized immigrants in the country, and imagine more pouring in.\n“The average person, particularly if they don’t live anywhere near the US-Mexico border, is probably not going to be able to make a judgment on how threatening the border is based on their own personal experience. What they tend to do is rely on statements made by sources of political information,” says Christopher Federico of the University of Minnesota. Trump told them the border was lawless. Furthermore, he emphasized “in-group/out-group” distinctions like native-born Americans versus immigrants — and “with that usually comes a consciousness of threat.”\nPresident Trump stirred up that threat. He may be able to calm it back down.\nIn a study published in 2016, researchers asked subjects how much of a threat they felt from Mexican immigration — and then had one group of subjects read an article that emphasized the security that already existed on the US-Mexico border, while another group read one emphasizing the border’s permeability.\nSubjects who already felt threatened by Mexican migration and read about the weakness of the border were more likely to overestimate how close Mexico City was to the United States, and to overestimate the number of Mexican immigrants currently living in the US. But people who had felt threatened by Mexican immigration and then read about how strong the border was were likely to feel that Mexico City was further away from the US — and that the Mexican immigrant population was smaller — than it actually was.\nYou could conclude that the wall will help people threatened by immigration feel safer. Or you could conclude that how safe people feel the border is depends on whether they’re told the border is safe or not.\nIf Trump wanted to declare victory on border security — with or without a wall — he might be able to persuade many of his supporters that immigration from the south was no longer a threat.\n“Trump might say, ‘Okay, we have built a wall, we have fixed this problem, it’s getting better,’” Federico says. “If he very consistently sends a signal like that, and he’s backed by other people in his party in saying the same thing, then I think you would expect to find that among Donald Trump supporters — and the public and Republicans more generally — they might think, ‘Okay, the problem’s getting better. We don’t have to worry about this to the same extent that we used to.’”\nHe might not even need to build the wall first. The simple fact of having a Republican in office, Federico conjectures, might allow Republicans to worry a little less about border security — in the same way that partisans assume the economy is better when the president is a member of their party. But if Trump actively sent that message, it would be much more effective.\nAlready the Trump administration is trumpeting a drop in border apprehensions as a victory for the president’s agenda — before a single brick (or transparent-but-still-impenetrable brick equivalent) has been laid.\nBut not every conservative is going along. Breitbart is pushing Trump officials on building a wall; Rush Limbaugh has already hinted he thinks the administration is caving on it. If that happens, Trump’s base won’t be getting a unified signal that the threat is over. What Trump thinks counts as a “wall” might, ultimately, be less important than what the Breitbart editorial board thinks.\nThe people who know better than anyone the costs we might pay for a wall are the people who live on the border.\n“Those of us (who) have lived along the border have long understood that dealing with Washington’s berrinches (tantrums) is just part of the deal,” former Ambassador to Mexico Tony Garza told Alfredo Corchado in an article published in Americas Quarterly earlier this year.\nThey’ve known from the beginning that the border has been anything but nonexistent. They’ve lived through its industrialization (or, as some might put it, militarization) — the fences, the expansion of Border Patrol, the surveillance.\n“I’ve lived on the border for almost 30 years now,” says Vicki Gaubeca, director of the Center for Border Rights at the ACLU of New Mexico. “It used to be a much more fluid border, where people would cross more easily and have family on both sides. And now it just seems that we’re more separated from each other.”\nBut as disrupted as the lives of border residents already are, building a wall — or even starting to build a wall — would be something else. It would be permanent and destructive and implacable.\nAlready the fear of a wall is reverberating through the economies of border communities. “Individuals are coming less and less to come shop at better stores on the US side,” Gaubeca says. Developers in Brownsville, Texas, blamed the collapse of a planned multimillion-dollar development in the town on the fence that the government was building along the border in the Rio Grande Valley.\nThe border is a region, and the people who are living there don’t particularly want to be walled off from each other. Even Republican voters who live within 350 miles of the border — the people whom the president supposedly wants to protect — are much more ambivalent about it than those farther away.\n“A lot of border communities think, ‘Net migration is zero; there are already so many resources that we have’” for border security, Gaubeca says. “What problem are we trying to solve?”\nThe benefits of building a wall across the border are questionable at best — it’s not clear whether doing more will be more effective than what already exists, or if the government is paying enough attention to make it more effective.\nBut the benefits won’t show up until the end of what promises to be a very long and slow process. It’s entirely possible that the effort will be started and then abandoned — or that the administration will abruptly shift to a “virtual wall” in an effort to claim an easier win.\nThat might prevent some of the fallout from a wall — the environmental danger, the money spent in court cases. It won’t work to reknit sundered halves of communities. The disruption of the border, as a region, is ongoing. Even considering a wall has symbolic power there. And every incremental step to turn the wall from symbol into reality works a little harder.\nWill you support Vox’s explanatory journalism?\nMillions turn to Vox to understand what’s happening in the news.
