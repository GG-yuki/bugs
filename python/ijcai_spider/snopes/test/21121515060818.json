            "report_content": "Support Intelligent, In-Depth, Trustworthy Journalism.\nWASHINGTON — President Donald Trump said he never called John McCain a loser — he did — and denigrated the record of the late Republican senator on veterans affairs despite routinely appropriating one of McCain’s crowning achievements on that front as his own.\nTrump distorted events in Kenosha, Wisconsin, over the past week and his own hand in them before a furor over his reported comments on fallen soldiers diverted his rhetoric.\nDemocratic rival Joe Biden claimed to have been the first person to have called for the use of emergency production powers in the pandemic, when he was not.\nA review:\nVETERANS and McCAIN\nRepublican presidential nominee Senator John McCain (R-Ariz.) listens as he is being introduced at a campaign rally in Denver, Colorado. Photo by Brian Snyder/Reuters\nTRUMP: “I was never a big fan of John McCain, disagreed with him on many things including ridiculous endless wars and the lack of success he had in dealing with the VA and our great Vets.” — part of a series of tweets Thursday.\nTHE FACTS: He’s ignoring McCain’s singular successes on behalf of fellow veterans.\nMcCain was a leading force in the Senate behind the law that gave veterans an option to go outside the Department of Veterans Affairs’ health care system and get private care at public expense under certain conditions. President Barack Obama signed the VA Choice legislation into law. Ignoring that reality, Trump persistently claims that he brought Choice into law when no one else could.\nTrump signed a law in 2018 that expanded the options for using the Choice program established by Obama, McCain and other lawmakers.\nThe 2018 law is named after three lawmakers who were veterans of war. All of them now are dead. They are Rep. Samuel R. Johnson, R-Texas, and Democratic Sen. Daniel K. Akaka, D-Hawaii, and McCain, R-Ariz.\n___\nTRUMP: “Also, I never called John a loser and swear on whatever, or whoever, I was asked to swear on, that I never called our great fallen soldiers anything other than HEROES.” — tweet Thursday.\nTHE FACTS: He called McCain a loser.\nIn addition, The Associated Press has confirmed many of the comments Trump was reported by The Atlantic to have made disparaging fallen or captured U.S. service members, such as his description of the American dead in a military graveyard as “losers.”\nAs for McCain, Trump told a conservative forum in Iowa in 2015 that his view of McCain changed when McCain lost the 2008 presidential election to Obama. “He lost, so I never liked him as much after that, ‘cause I don’t like losers,” he said. Trump went on to dismiss McCain’s war service: “He’s not a war hero. He’s a war hero because he was captured. I like people that weren’t captured.”\nTrump in 2015 also tweeted a news article on Twitter calling McCain a “loser.”\n___\nPANDEMIC\nBIDEN: “When it got up to March, I kept saying, ‘Look, you’ve got to invoke,’ and you remember, I think I was the first — I may be mistaken — person calling for the Defense Production Act.” — comment after a news conference Wednesday.\nTHE FACTS: He is correct about being mistaken.\nBiden issued a statement March 18 saying he was issuing a call for Trump to invoke the Defense Production Act to give priority to “and immediately increase domestic production of any critical medical equipment required to respond to this crisis — such as the production of ventilators and associated training to operate.” His call came the same day Trump signed an order to use his authority under the act.\nFive days earlier a group of Democrats in Congress wrote to Trump asking him to use powers under the act, a step that Trump officials and others had been discussing publicly for several weeks.\n___\nPROTESTS and VIOLENCE\nPolice officers are seen during a protest following the police shooting of Jacob Blake, a Black man, in Kenosha, Wisconsin. Photo by Brendan McDermid/Reuters\nTRUMP, on Wisconsin officials and the National Guard: “Once they responded and once we took, you know, control of it, things went really well.” — remarks in Kenosha on Tuesday.\nTRUMP: “One of the reasons I’m making the trip today and going to Wisconsin is we’ve had such a big success in shutting down what would be, right now, a city — that would’ve been Kenosha — a city that would’ve been burnt to the ground by now. … And it all stopped immediately upon the National Guard’s arrival.” — remarks Tuesday before visiting Wisconsin.\nTHE FACTS: Not true. He had nothing to do with the deployment of the National Guard in Wisconsin. The federal government never “took control of it.”\nGov. Tony Evers, D-Wis., activated the state’s National Guard the day after a Kenosha police officer shot Jacob Blake, sparking protests and violence over police actions and racism. When National Guard forces from three other states came in to help, it was because the governor had asked for that help from fellow governors, not the White House.\nEvers said National Guard troops from Arizona, Michigan and Alabama were operating under the control of those states and Wisconsin, “not in a federal status.” National Guards answer to governors and sometimes state legislatures, not Washington.\nThe federal government sent deputy marshals from the U.S. Marshals Service and agents from the FBI and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, about 200 in all. The restoration of order was primarily in the hands of National Guard units and local law enforcement.\nAs of Monday, 1,000 National Guard troops from Wisconsin were in Kenosha along with 500 National Guard troops from the other three states, said Wisconsin National Guard Maj. Gen. Paul Knapp.\n___\nTRUMP, asked if would condemn the actions of Kyle Rittenhouse, the 17-year-old charged in the shooting deaths of two men during Kenosha protests: “You saw the same tape as I saw. And he was trying to get away from them, I guess; it looks like. And he fell, and then they very violently attacked him. And it was something that we’re looking at right now and it’s under investigation. But I guess he was in very big trouble. He would have been — I — he probably would have been killed.” — news conference Monday.\nTHE FACTS: His implication that Rittenhouse only shot the men after he tripped and they attacked him is wrong. The first fatal shooting happened before Rittenhouse ran away and fell.\nTrump did not say whom he meant by “they” — the two men he shot or others in pursuit of him. But he spoke in defense of someone who opposed racial justice protesters, who authorities say was illegally carrying a semi-automatic rifle and who prosecutors accuse of committing intentional homicide.\nAccording to the criminal complaint released by prosecutors, victim Joseph Rosenbaum was shot and killed first, after following Rittenhouse into a parking lot, where Rosenbaum threw a plastic bag at the gunman and tried to take the weapon from him.\nThe medical examiner found that Rosenbaum was shot in the groin and back — which fractured his pelvis and perforated his right lung and liver — and his left hand. He also suffered a superficial wound to his left thigh and a graze wound to his forehead.\nRittenhouse then ran down the street and was chased by several people trying to stop him and shouting that he just shot someone, according to the criminal complaint and cellphone video footage.\nHe tripped and fell. Anthony Huber, who was carrying a skateboard, was shot in the chest after apparently trying to wrest the gun from Rittenhouse, the complaint said. A third man was shot and injured.\nRittenhouse’s lawyer said he acted to defend himself.\n___\nVOTING FRAUD\nATTORNEY GENERAL WILLIAM BARR on fraud in the vote-by-mail process: “Elections that have been held with mail have found substantial fraud and coercion.” — CNN on Wednesday.\nTHE FACTS: Actually, multiple studies have debunked the notion of pervasive voter fraud in general and in the vote-by-mail process.\nThe five states that relied on mail-in ballots even before the coronavirus pandemic — Colorado, Hawaii, Oregon, Washington and Utah — have said they have necessary safeguards in place to ensure against fraud and to prevent hostile foreign actors from co-opting the vote. More states intend to rely more heavily on mail-in voting this fall because of the pandemic.\nThe attorney general cited a report from more than a decade ago from a commission led by former President Jimmy Carter and former Secretary of State James Baker that said vote-by-mail was vulnerable to fraud. But the commission pointed out in a statement in May that it had found little evidence of fraud in states such as Oregon that had sufficient safeguards.\nBarr also said he was basing on “logic” his concern that a hostile foreign actor could produce bogus ballots for the election. But senior U.S. officials said on a conference call with reporters last month that they had no intelligence to suggest that was happening.\n_____\nJOBS\nBIDEN: “Donald Trump may be the only president in modern history to leave office with fewer jobs than when he took office.” — Wilmington, Delaware, speech Friday.\nTHE FACTS: Maybe yes, maybe no.\nNot since Depression-era Herbert Hoover has a president left office with a record of fewer jobs than when he began.\nThis could happen to Trump because of the pandemic, but he could also end up with a small gain.\nIn August there were 4.7 million fewer jobs than there were when Trump was inaugurated in January 2017. But if he leaves office in five months, and if the economy adds more than 1 million jobs each month, as happened in July and August, he could end up in the black. There are signs, though, that the gains are slowing as businesses have recalled many of the workers who were temporarily laid off from restaurants, bars, retailers and other businesses. So Biden’s prediction could come true.\nLeft:\n                U.S. President Donald Trump delivers a speech following a tour of Fincantieri Marinette Marine in Marinette, Wisconsin, U.S., June 25, 2020.

            "report_content": "John Sidney McCain III (August 29, 1936 – August 25, 2018) was an American politician, statesman and United States Navy officer who served as a United States Senator for Arizona from 1987 until his death in 2018. He previously served two terms in the United States House of Representatives and was the Republican nominee for president of the United States in the 2008 election, which he lost to Barack Obama.\nMcCain graduated from the United States Naval Academy in 1958 and received a commission in the United States Navy. He became a naval aviator and flew ground-attack aircraft from aircraft carriers. During the Vietnam War, McCain almost died in the 1967 USS Forrestal fire. While on a bombing mission during Operation Rolling Thunder over Hanoi in October 1967, he was shot down, seriously injured, and captured by the North Vietnamese. McCain was a prisoner of war until 1973. He experienced episodes of torture and refused an out-of-sequence early release. During the war, McCain sustained wounds that left him with lifelong physical disabilities. He retired from the Navy as a captain in 1981 and moved to Arizona, where he entered politics.\nIn 1982, McCain was elected to the United States House of Representatives, where he served two terms. He was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1986, succeeding the 1964 Republican presidential nominee and conservative icon Barry Goldwater upon his retirement. McCain easily won reelection five times. While generally adhering to conservative principles, McCain also gained a reputation as a \"maverick\" for his willingness to break from his party on certain issues, including LGBT rights, gun regulations, and campaign finance reform where his stances were more moderate than those of the party's base. McCain was investigated and largely exonerated in a political influence scandal of the 1980s as one of the Keating Five; he then made regulating the financing of political campaigns one of his signature concerns, which eventually resulted in passage of the McCain–Feingold Act in 2002. He was also known for his work in the 1990s to restore diplomatic relations with Vietnam. McCain chaired the Senate Commerce Committee from 1997 to 2001 and 2003 to 2005, where he opposed pork barrel spending and earmarks. He belonged to the bipartisan \"Gang of 14\", which played a key role in alleviating a crisis over judicial nominations.\nMcCain entered the race for the Republican nomination for president in 2000 but lost a heated primary season contest to Governor George W. Bush of Texas. He secured the Republican presidential nomination in 2008, beating fellow candidates Mitt Romney and Mike Huckabee, though he lost the general election to Barack Obama. McCain subsequently adopted more orthodox conservative stances and attitudes and largely opposed actions of the Obama administration, especially with regard to foreign policy matters. In 2015, he became Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee. He refused to support then-Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump in 2016; McCain won re-election to a sixth and final term that same year. McCain was a vocal critic of the Trump administration. While McCain opposed the Affordable Care Act, he cast the deciding vote against the ACA-repealing American Health Care Act of 2017.[1] After being diagnosed with brain cancer (Glioblastoma) in 2017, he reduced his role in the Senate in order to focus on treatment, and supported the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. He died on August 25, 2018, aged 81. Following his death, McCain lay in state in the Arizona State Capitol rotunda and then in the United States Capitol rotunda. His funeral was televised from the Washington National Cathedral, with the former presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama giving eulogies.[2][3]\nJohn Sidney McCain III was born on August 29, 1936, at Coco Solo Naval Air Station in the Panama Canal Zone, to naval officer John S. McCain Jr. and Roberta (Wright) McCain. He had an older sister, Sandy, and a younger brother, Joe.[4] At that time, the Panama Canal was under U.S. control.[5]\nMcCain's family tree includes Scotch-Irish and English ancestors.[6] His great-great-great-grandparents owned High Rock Farm, a plantation in Rockingham County, North Carolina.[7]  His father and his paternal grandfather, John S. McCain Sr., were also Naval Academy graduates and both became four-star admirals in the United States Navy.[8] The McCain family moved with their father as he took various naval postings in the United States and in the Pacific.[4][9]\nAs a result, the younger McCain attended a total of about 20 schools.[10] In 1951, the family settled in Northern Virginia, and McCain attended Episcopal High School, a private preparatory boarding school in Alexandria.[11][12] He excelled at wrestling and graduated in 1954.[13][14] He referred to himself as an Episcopalian as recently as June 2007, after which date he said he came to identify as a Baptist.[15]\nFollowing in the footsteps of his father and grandfather, McCain entered the United States Naval Academy, where he was a friend and informal leader for many of his classmates[16] and sometimes stood up for targets of bullying.[8] He also fought as a lightweight boxer.[17] Nicknamed \"John Wayne\" \"for his attitude and popularity with the opposite sex.\"[18] McCain did well in academic subjects that interested him, such as literature and history, but studied only enough to pass subjects that gave him difficulty, such as mathematics.[8][19] He came into conflict with higher-ranking personnel and did not always obey the rules. \"He collected demerits the way some people collect stamps.\"[18] His class rank (894 of 899) was not indicative of his intelligence nor his IQ.[16][20] McCain graduated in 1958.[16]\nMcCain began his early military career when he was commissioned as an ensign, and started two and a half years of training at Pensacola to become a naval aviator.[21] While there, he earned a reputation as a man who partied.[10] He completed flight school in 1960, and became a naval pilot of ground-attack aircraft; he was assigned to A-1 Skyraider squadrons[22] aboard the aircraft carriers USS Intrepid and USS Enterprise[23] in the Caribbean and Mediterranean Seas.[24] McCain began as a sub-par flier[24] who was at times careless and reckless;[25] during the early to mid-1960s, two of his flight missions crashed, and a third mission collided with power lines, but he received no major injuries.[25] His aviation skills improved over time,[24] and he was seen as a good pilot, albeit one who tended to \"push the envelope\" in his flying.[25]\nOn July 3, 1965, McCain was 28 when he married Carol Shepp, who had worked as a runway model and secretary.[26] McCain adopted her two young children, Douglas and Andrew.[23][27] He and Carol then had a daughter whom they named Sidney.[28][29] The same year, he was a one-day champion on the game show Jeopardy!.[30]\nMcCain requested a combat assignment,[31] and was assigned to the aircraft carrier USS Forrestal flying A-4 Skyhawks.[32] His combat duty began when he was 30 years old in mid-1967, when Forrestal was assigned to a bombing campaign, Operation Rolling Thunder, during the Vietnam War.[26][33] Stationed in the Gulf of Tonkin, McCain and his fellow pilots became frustrated by micromanagement from Washington, and he later wrote, \"In all candor, we thought our civilian commanders were complete idiots who didn't have the least notion of what it took to win the war.\"[33][34]\nOn July 29, 1967, McCain was a lieutenant commander when he was near the center of the USS Forrestal fire. He escaped from his burning jet and was trying to help another pilot escape when a bomb exploded;[35] McCain was struck in the legs and chest by fragments.[36] The ensuing fire killed 134 sailors and took 24 hours to control.[37][38] With the Forrestal out of commission, McCain volunteered for assignment with the USS Oriskany, another aircraft carrier employed in Operation Rolling Thunder.[39] There, he was awarded the Navy Commendation Medal and the Bronze Star Medal for missions flown over North Vietnam.[40]\nMcCain was taken prisoner of war on October 26, 1967. He was flying his 23rd bombing mission over North Vietnam when his A-4E Skyhawk was shot down by a missile over Hanoi.[41][42] McCain fractured both arms and a leg when he ejected from the aircraft,[43] and nearly drowned after he parachuted into Trúc Bạch Lake. Some North Vietnamese pulled him ashore, then others crushed his shoulder with a rifle butt and bayoneted him.[41] McCain was then transported to Hanoi's main Hỏa Lò Prison, nicknamed the \"Hanoi Hilton\".[42]\nAlthough McCain was seriously wounded and injured, his captors refused to treat him. They beat and interrogated him to get information, and he was given medical care only when the North Vietnamese discovered that his father was an admiral.[44] His status as a prisoner of war (POW) made the front pages of major American newspapers.[45][46]\nMcCain spent six weeks in the hospital, where he received marginal care. He had lost 50 pounds (23 kg), he was in a chest cast, and his gray hair had turned white.[41] McCain was sent to a different camp on the outskirts of Hanoi.[47] In December 1967, McCain was placed in a cell with two other Americans, who did not expect him to live more than a week.[48] In March 1968, McCain was placed into solitary confinement, where he remained for two years.[49]\nIn mid-1968, his father John S. McCain Jr. was named commander of all U.S. forces in the Vietnam theater, and the North Vietnamese offered McCain early release[50] because they wanted to appear merciful for propaganda purposes,[51] and also to show other POWs that elite prisoners were willing to be treated preferentially.[50] McCain refused repatriation unless every man taken in before him was also released. Such early release was prohibited by the POWs' interpretation of the military Code of Conduct, which states in Article III: \"I will accept neither parole nor special favors from the enemy.\"[52] To prevent the enemy from using prisoners for propaganda, officers were to agree to be released in the order in which they were captured.[41]\nBeginning in August 1968, McCain was subjected to a program of severe torture.[53] He was bound and beaten every two hours; this punishment occurred at the same time that he was suffering from heat exhaustion and dysentery.[41][53] Further injuries brought McCain to \"the point of suicide,\" but his preparations were interrupted by guards. Eventually, McCain made an anti-U.S. propaganda \"confession.\"[41] He had always felt that his statement was dishonorable, but as he later wrote, \"I had learned what we all learned over there: every man has his breaking point. I had reached mine.\"[54][55] Many U.S. POWs were tortured and maltreated in order to extract \"confessions\" and propaganda statements;[56] virtually all of them eventually yielded something to their captors.[57] McCain received two to three beatings weekly because of his continued refusal to sign additional statements.[58]\nMcCain refused to meet various anti-war groups seeking peace in Hanoi, wanting to give neither them nor the North Vietnamese a propaganda victory.[59] From late 1969, treatment of McCain and many of the other POWs became more tolerable,[60] while McCain continued to resist the camp authorities.[61] McCain and other prisoners cheered the U.S. \"Christmas Bombing\" campaign of December 1972, viewing it as a forceful measure to push North Vietnam to terms.[55][62]\nMcCain was a prisoner of war in North Vietnam for five and a half years, until his release on March 14, 1973, along with 108 other prisoners of war.[63] His wartime injuries left him permanently incapable of raising his arms above his head.[64] After the war, McCain, accompanied by his family and his second wife Cindy, returned to the site on a few occasions in efforts of trying to come to terms with what had happened to him there during his capture.[65]\nMcCain was reunited with his family when he returned to the United States. His wife Carol had been severely injured by an automobile accident in December 1969. She was then four inches shorter, in a wheelchair or on crutches, and substantially heavier than when he had last seen her. As a returned POW, he became a celebrity of sorts.[66]\nMcCain underwent treatment for his injuries that included months of physical therapy.[67] He attended the National War College at Fort McNair in Washington, D.C. during 1973–1974.[68] He was rehabilitated by late 1974, and his flight status was reinstated. In 1976, he became Commanding Officer of a training squadron that was stationed in Florida.[66][69] He improved the unit's flight readiness and safety records,[70] and won the squadron its first-ever Meritorious Unit Commendation.[69] During this period in Florida, he had extramarital affairs, and his marriage began to falter, about which he later stated: \"The blame was entirely mine\".[71][72]\nMcCain served as the Navy's liaison to the U.S. Senate beginning in 1977.[73] In retrospect, he said that this represented his \"real entry into the world of politics, and the beginning of my second career as a public servant.\"[66] His key behind-the-scenes role gained congressional financing for a new supercarrier against the wishes of the Carter administration.[67][74]\nIn April 1979,[67] McCain met Cindy Lou Hensley, a teacher from Phoenix, Arizona, whose father had founded a large beer distributorship.[72] They began dating, and he urged his wife, Carol, to grant him a divorce, which she did in February 1980; the uncontested divorce took effect in April 1980.[27][67] The settlement included two houses, and financial support for her ongoing medical treatments due to her 1969 car accident; they remained on good terms.[72] McCain and Hensley were married on May 17, 1980, with Senators William Cohen and Gary Hart attending as groomsmen.[26][72] McCain's children did not attend, and several years passed before they reconciled.[29][67] John and Cindy McCain entered into a prenuptial agreement that kept most of her family's assets under her name; they kept their finances apart, and filed separate income tax returns.[75]\nMcCain decided to leave the Navy. It was doubtful whether he would ever be promoted to the rank of full admiral, as he had poor annual physicals and had not been given a major sea command.[76] His chances of being promoted to rear admiral were better, but he declined that prospect, as he had already made plans to run for Congress and said he could \"do more good there.\"[77][78]\nMcCain retired from the Navy as a captain on April 1, 1981.[40][79] He was designated as disabled and awarded a disability pension.[80] Upon leaving the military, he moved to Arizona. His numerous military decorations and awards include: the Silver Star, two Legion of Merits, Distinguished Flying Cross, three Bronze Star Medals, two Purple Hearts, two Navy and Marine Corps Commendation Medals, and the Prisoner of War Medal.[40]\nMcCain set his sights on becoming a representative because he was interested in current events, was ready for a new challenge, and had developed political ambitions during his time as Senate liaison.[72][81][82] Living in Phoenix, he went to work for Hensley & Co., his new father-in-law Jim Hensley's large Anheuser-Busch beer distributorship.[72] As vice president of public relations at the distributorship, he gained political support among the local business community, meeting powerful figures such as banker Charles Keating Jr., real estate developer Fife Symington III (later Governor of Arizona) and newspaper publisher Darrow \"Duke\" Tully.[73] In 1982, McCain ran as a Republican for an open seat in Arizona's 1st congressional district, which was being vacated by 30-year incumbent Republican John Jacob Rhodes.[83] A newcomer to the state, McCain was hit with charges of being a carpetbagger.[72] McCain responded to a voter making that charge with what a Phoenix Gazette columnist later described as \"the most devastating response to a potentially troublesome political issue I've ever heard\":[72]\nListen, pal. I spent 22 years in the Navy. My father was in the Navy. My grandfather was in the Navy. We in the military service tend to move a lot. We have to live in all parts of the country, all parts of the world. I wish I could have had the luxury, like you, of growing up and living and spending my entire life in a nice place like the First District of Arizona, but I was doing other things. As a matter of fact, when I think about it now, the place I lived longest in my life was Hanoi.[72][84]\nMcCain won a highly contested primary election with the assistance of local political endorsements, his Washington connections, and money that his wife lent to his campaign.[72][73] He then easily won the general election in the heavily Republican district.[72]\nIn 1983, McCain was elected to lead the incoming group of Republican representatives,[72] and was assigned to the House Committee on Interior Affairs. Also that year, he opposed creation of a federal Martin Luther King Jr. Day, but admitted in 2008: \"I was wrong and eventually realized that, in time to give full support [in 1990] for a state holiday in Arizona.\"[85][86]\nAt this point, McCain's politics were mainly in line with those of President Ronald Reagan; this included support for Reaganomics, and he was active on Indian Affairs bills.[87] He supported most aspects of the foreign policy of the Reagan administration, including its hardline stance against the Soviet Union and policy towards Central American conflicts, such as backing the Contras in Nicaragua.[87] McCain opposed keeping U.S. Marines deployed in Lebanon, citing unattainable objectives, and subsequently criticized President Reagan for pulling out the troops too late; in the interim, the 1983 Beirut barracks bombing killed hundreds.[72][88] McCain won re-election to the House easily in 1984,[72] and gained a spot on the House Foreign Affairs Committee.[89] In 1985, he made his first return trip to Vietnam,[90] and also traveled to Chile where he met with its military junta ruler, General Augusto Pinochet.[91][92][93]\nIn 1984, McCain and Cindy had their first child, daughter Meghan, followed two years later by son John IV and in 1988 by son James.[94] In 1991, Cindy brought an abandoned three-month-old girl needing medical treatment to the U.S. from a Bangladeshi orphanage run by Mother Teresa.[95] The McCains decided to adopt her and she was named Bridget.[96]\nMcCain's Senate career began in January 1987, after he defeated his Democratic opponent, former state legislator Richard Kimball, by 20 percentage points in the 1986 election.[73][97] McCain succeeded Arizona native, conservative icon, and the 1964 Republican presidential nominee Barry Goldwater upon Goldwater's retirement as U.S. senator from Arizona for 30 years.[97] In January 1988, McCain voted in favor of the Civil Rights Restoration Act of 1987,[98] and voted to override President Reagan's veto of that legislation the following March.[99]\nSenator McCain became a member of the Armed Services Committee, with which he had formerly done his Navy liaison work; he also joined the Commerce Committee and the Indian Affairs Committee.[97] He continued to support the Native American agenda.[100] As first a House member and then a senator—and as a lifelong gambler with close ties to the gambling industry[101]—McCain was one of the main authors of the 1988 Indian Gaming Regulatory Act,[102][103] which codified rules regarding Native American gambling enterprises.[104] McCain was also a strong supporter of the Gramm-Rudman legislation that enforced automatic spending cuts in the case of budget deficits.[105]\nMcCain soon gained national visibility. He delivered a well-received speech at the 1988 Republican National Convention, was mentioned by the press as a short list vice-presidential running mate for Republican nominee George H. W. Bush, and was named chairman of Veterans for Bush.[97][106]\nMcCain became embroiled in a scandal during the 1980s, as one of five United States senators comprising the so-called Keating Five.[107] Between 1982 and 1987, McCain had received $112,000 in lawful[108] political contributions from Charles Keating Jr. and his associates at Lincoln Savings and Loan Association, along with trips on Keating's jets[107] that McCain belatedly repaid, in 1989.[109] In 1987, McCain was one of the five senators whom Keating contacted in order to prevent the government's seizure of Lincoln, and McCain met twice with federal regulators to discuss the government's investigation of Lincoln.[107] In 1999, McCain said: \"The appearance of it was wrong. It's a wrong appearance when a group of senators appear in a meeting with a group of regulators, because it conveys the impression of undue and improper influence. And it was the wrong thing to do.\"[110] In the end, McCain was cleared by the Senate Ethics Committee of acting improperly or violating any law or Senate rule, but was mildly rebuked for exercising \"poor judgment\".[108][110][111]\nIn his 1992 re-election bid, the Keating Five affair was not a major issue,[112] and he won handily, gaining 56 percent of the vote to defeat Democratic community and civil rights activist Claire Sargent and independent former governor, Evan Mecham.[113]\nMcCain developed a reputation for independence during the 1990s.[114] He took pride in challenging party leadership and establishment forces, becoming difficult to categorize politically.[114]\nAs a member of the 1991–1993 Senate Select Committee on POW/MIA Affairs, chaired by fellow Vietnam War veteran and Democrat, John Kerry, McCain investigated the Vietnam War POW/MIA issue, to determine the fate of U.S. service personnel listed as missing in action during the Vietnam War.[115] The committee's unanimous report stated there was \"no compelling evidence that proves that any American remains alive in captivity in Southeast Asia.\"[116] Helped by McCain's efforts, in 1995 the U.S. normalized diplomatic relations with Vietnam.[117] McCain was vilified by some POW/MIA activists who, despite the committee's unanimous report, believed large numbers of Americans were still held against their will in Southeast Asia.[117][118][119] From January 1993 until his death, McCain was Chairman of the International Republican Institute, an organization partly funded by the U.S. government that supports the emergence of political democracy worldwide.[120]\nIn 1993 and 1994, McCain voted to confirm President Clinton's nominees Stephen Breyer and Ruth Bader Ginsburg whom he considered to be qualified for the U.S. Supreme Court. He later explained that \"under our Constitution, it is the president's call to make.\"[121] McCain had also voted to confirm nominees of Presidents Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush, including Robert Bork and Clarence Thomas.[122]\nMcCain attacked what he saw as the corrupting influence of large political contributions—from corporations, labor unions, other organizations, and wealthy individuals—and he made this his signature issue.[123] Starting in 1994, he worked with Democratic Wisconsin Senator Russ Feingold on campaign finance reform; their McCain–Feingold bill attempted to put limits on \"soft money\".[123] The efforts of McCain and Feingold were opposed by some of the moneyed interests targeted, by incumbents in both parties, by those who felt spending limits impinged on free political speech and might be unconstitutional as well, and by those who wanted to counterbalance the power of what they saw as media bias.[123][124] Despite sympathetic coverage in the media, initial versions of the McCain–Feingold Act were filibustered and never came to a vote.[125]\nThe term \"maverick Republican\" became a label frequently applied to McCain, and he also used it himself.[123][126][127] In 1993, McCain opposed military operations in Somalia.[128] Another target of his was pork barrel spending by Congress, and he actively supported the Line Item Veto Act of 1996, which gave the president power to veto individual spending items[123] but was ruled unconstitutional by the Supreme Court in 1998.[129]\nIn the 1996 presidential election, McCain was again on the short list of possible vice-presidential picks, this time for Republican nominee Bob Dole.[112][130] The following year, Time magazine named McCain as one of the \"25 Most Influential People in America\".[131]\nIn 1997, McCain became chairman of the powerful Senate Commerce Committee; he was criticized for accepting funds from corporations and businesses under the committee's purview, but in response said the small contributions he received were not part of the big-money nature of the campaign finance problem.[123] McCain took on the tobacco industry in 1998, proposing legislation that would increase cigarette taxes in order to fund anti-smoking campaigns, discourage teenage smokers, increase money for health research studies, and help states pay for smoking-related health care costs.[123][132] Supported by the Clinton administration but opposed by the industry and most Republicans, the bill failed to gain cloture.[132]\nIn November 1998, McCain won re-election to a third Senate term; he prevailed in a landslide over his Democratic opponent, environmental lawyer Ed Ranger.[123] In the February 1999 Senate trial following the impeachment of Bill Clinton, McCain voted to convict the president on both the perjury and obstruction of justice counts, saying Clinton had violated his sworn oath of office.[133] In March 1999, McCain voted to approve the NATO bombing campaign against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, saying that the ongoing genocide of the Kosovo War must be stopped and criticizing past Clinton administration inaction.[134] Later in 1999, McCain shared the Profile in Courage Award with Feingold for their work in trying to enact their campaign finance reform,[135] although the bill was still failing repeated attempts to gain cloture.[125]\nIn August 1999, McCain's memoir Faith of My Fathers, co-authored with Mark Salter, was published;[136] a reviewer observed that its appearance \"seems to have been timed to the unfolding Presidential campaign.\"[137] The most successful of his writings, it received positive reviews,[138] became a bestseller,[139] and was later made into a TV film.[140] The book traces McCain's family background and childhood, covers his time at Annapolis and his service before and during the Vietnam War, concluding with his release from captivity in 1973. According to one reviewer, it describes \"the kind of challenges that most of us can barely imagine. It's a fascinating history of a remarkable military family.\"[141]\nMcCain announced his candidacy for president on September 27, 1999, in Nashua, New Hampshire, saying he was staging \"a fight to take our government back from the power brokers and special interests, and return it to the people and the noble cause of freedom it was created to serve\".[136][142] The frontrunner for the Republican nomination was Texas Governor George W. Bush, who had the political and financial support of most of the party establishment, whereas McCain was supported by many moderate Republicans and some conservative Republicans.[143]\nMcCain focused on the New Hampshire primary, where his message appealed to independents.[144] He traveled on a campaign bus called the Straight Talk Express.[136] He held many town hall meetings, answering every question voters asked, in a successful example of \"retail politics\", and he used free media to compensate for his lack of funds.[136] One reporter later recounted that, \"McCain talked all day long with reporters on his Straight Talk Express bus; he talked so much that sometimes he said things that he shouldn't have, and that's why the media loved him.\"[145] On February 1, 2000, he won New Hampshire's primary with 49 percent of the vote to Bush's 30 percent. The Bush campaign and the Republican establishment feared that a McCain victory in the crucial South Carolina primary might give his campaign unstoppable momentum.[136][146]\nThe Arizona Republic wrote that the McCain–Bush primary contest in South Carolina \"has entered national political lore as a low-water mark in presidential campaigns\", while The New York Times called it \"a painful symbol of the brutality of American politics\".[136][148][149] A variety of interest groups, which McCain had challenged in the past, ran negative ads.[136][150] Bush borrowed McCain's earlier language of reform,[151] and declined to dissociate himself from a veterans activist who accused McCain (in Bush's presence) of having \"abandoned the veterans\" on POW/MIA and Agent Orange issues.[136][152]\nIncensed,[152] McCain ran ads accusing Bush of lying and comparing the governor to Bill Clinton, which Bush said was \"about as low a blow as you can give in a Republican primary\".[136] An anonymous smear campaign began against McCain, delivered by push polls, faxes, e-mails, flyers, and audience plants.[136][153] The smears claimed that McCain had fathered a black child out of wedlock (the McCains' dark-skinned daughter was adopted from Bangladesh), that his wife Cindy was a drug addict, that he was a homosexual, and that he was a \"Manchurian Candidate\" who was either a traitor or mentally unstable from his North Vietnam POW days.[136][148] The Bush campaign strongly denied any involvement with the attacks.[148][154]\nMcCain lost South Carolina on February 19, with 42 percent of the vote to Bush's 53 percent,[155] in part because Bush mobilized the state's evangelical voters[136][156] and outspent McCain.[157] The win allowed Bush to regain lost momentum.[155] McCain said of the rumor spreaders, \"I believe that there is a special place in hell for people like those.\"[96] According to one acquaintance, the South Carolina experience left him in a \"very dark place\".[148]\nMcCain's campaign never completely recovered from his South Carolina defeat, although he did rebound partially by winning in Arizona and Michigan a few days later.[158] He made a speech in Virginia Beach that criticized Christian leaders, including Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell, as divisive conservatives,[148] declaring \"... we embrace the fine members of the religious conservative community. But that does not mean that we will pander to their self-appointed leaders.\"[159] McCain lost the Virginia primary on February 29,[160] and on March 7 lost nine of the thirteen primaries on Super Tuesday to Bush.[161] With little hope of overcoming Bush's delegate lead, McCain withdrew from the race on March 9, 2000.[162] He endorsed Bush two months later,[163] and made occasional appearances with the Texas governor during the general election campaign.[136]\nMcCain began 2001 by breaking with the new George W. Bush administration on a number of matters, including HMO reform, climate change, and gun control legislation; McCain–Feingold was opposed by Bush as well.[125][164] In May 2001, McCain was one of only two Senate Republicans to vote against the Bush tax cuts.[164][165] Besides the differences with Bush on ideological grounds, there was considerable antagonism between the two remaining from the previous year's campaign.[166][167] Later, when a Republican senator, Jim Jeffords, became an Independent, thereby throwing control of the Senate to the Democrats, McCain defended Jeffords against \"self-appointed enforcers of party loyalty\".[164] Indeed, there was speculation at the time, and in years since, about McCain himself leaving the Republican Party, but McCain had always adamantly denied that he ever considered doing so.[164][168][169] Beginning in 2001, McCain used political capital gained from his presidential run, as well as improved legislative skills and relationships with other members, to become one of the Senate's most influential members.[170]\nAfter the September 11, 2001, attacks, McCain supported Bush and the U.S.-led war in Afghanistan.[164][171] He and Democratic senator Joe Lieberman wrote the legislation that created the 9/11 Commission,[172] while he and Democratic senator Fritz Hollings co-sponsored the Aviation and Transportation Security Act that federalized airport security.[173]\nIn March 2002, McCain–Feingold, officially known as the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002, passed in both Houses of Congress and was signed into law by President Bush.[125][164] Seven years in the making, it was McCain's greatest legislative achievement.[164][174]\nMeanwhile, in discussions over proposed U.S. action against Iraq, McCain was a strong supporter of the Bush administration's position.[164] He stated that Iraq was \"a clear and present danger to the United States of America\", and voted accordingly for the Iraq War Resolution in October 2002.[164] He predicted that U.S. forces would be treated as liberators by a large number of the Iraqi people.[175] In May 2003, McCain voted against the second round of Bush tax cuts, saying it was unwise at a time of war.[165] By November 2003, after a trip to Iraq, he was publicly questioning Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, saying that more U.S. troops were needed; the following year, McCain announced that he had lost confidence in Rumsfeld.[176][177]\nIn October 2003, McCain and Lieberman co-sponsored the Climate Stewardship Act that would have introduced a cap and trade system aimed at returning greenhouse gas emissions to 2000 levels; the bill was defeated with 55 votes to 43 in the Senate.[178] They reintroduced modified versions of the Act two additional times, for the final time in January 2007 with the co-sponsorship of Barack Obama, among others.[179]\nIn the 2004 U.S. presidential election campaign, McCain was once again frequently mentioned for the vice-presidential slot, only this time as part of the Democratic ticket under nominee John Kerry.[180][181][182] McCain said that Kerry had never formally offered him the position and that he would not have accepted it if he had.[181][182][183] At the 2004 Republican National Convention, McCain supported Bush for re-election, praising Bush's management of the War on Terror since the September 11 attacks.[184] At the same time, he defended Kerry's Vietnam War record.[185] By August 2004, McCain had the best favorable-to-unfavorable rating (55 percent to 19 percent) of any national politician;[184] he campaigned for Bush much more than he had four years previously, though the two remained situational allies rather than friends.[166]\nMcCain was also up for re-election as senator, in 2004. He defeated little-known Democratic schoolteacher Stuart Starky with his biggest margin of victory, garnering 77 percent of the vote.[186]\nIn May 2005, McCain led the so-called Gang of 14 in the Senate, which established a compromise that preserved the ability of senators to filibuster judicial nominees, but only in \"extraordinary circumstances\".[187] The compromise took the steam out of the filibuster movement, but some Republicans remained disappointed that the compromise did not eliminate filibusters of judicial nominees in all circumstances.[188] McCain subsequently cast Supreme Court confirmation votes in favor of John Roberts and Samuel Alito, calling them \"two of the finest justices ever appointed to the United States Supreme Court.\"[122]\nBreaking from his 2001 and 2003 votes, McCain supported the Bush tax cut extension in May 2006, saying not to do so would amount to a tax increase.[165] Working with Democratic Senator Ted Kennedy, McCain was a strong proponent of comprehensive immigration reform, which would involve legalization, guest worker programs, and border enforcement components. The Secure America and Orderly Immigration Act was never voted on in 2005, while the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2006 passed the Senate in May 2006 but failed in the House.[177] In June 2007, President Bush, McCain, and others made the strongest push yet for such a bill, the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2007, but it aroused intense grassroots opposition among talk radio listeners and others, some of whom furiously characterized the proposal as an \"amnesty\" program,[189] and the bill twice failed to gain cloture in the Senate.[190]\nBy the middle of the 2000s (decade), the increased Indian gaming that McCain had helped bring about was a $23 billion industry.[103] He was twice chairman of the Senate Indian Affairs Committee, in 1995–1997 and 2005–2007, and his Committee helped expose the Jack Abramoff Indian lobbying scandal.[191][192] By 2005 and 2006, McCain was pushing for amendments to the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act which would have limited creation of off-reservation casinos,[103] and also limited the movement of tribes across state lines to build casinos.[193]\nOwing to his time as a POW, McCain was recognized for his sensitivity to the detention and interrogation of detainees in the War on Terror. An opponent of the Bush administration's use of torture and detention without trial at Guantánamo Bay, saying: \"some of these guys are terrible, terrible killers and the worst kind of scum of humanity. But, one, they deserve to have some adjudication of their cases ... even Adolf Eichmann got a trial\".[194] In October 2005, McCain introduced the McCain Detainee Amendment to the Defense Appropriations bill for 2005, and the Senate voted 90–9 to support the amendment.[195] It prohibits inhumane treatment of prisoners, including prisoners at Guantánamo, by confining military interrogations to the techniques in the U.S. Army Field Manual on Interrogation. Although Bush had threatened to veto the bill if McCain's amendment was included,[196] the President announced in December 2005 that he accepted McCain's terms and would \"make it clear to the world that this government does not torture and that we adhere to the international convention of torture, whether it be here at home or abroad\".[197] This stance, among others, led to McCain being named by Time magazine in 2006 as one of America's 10 Best Senators.[198] McCain voted in February 2008 against a bill containing a ban on waterboarding,[199] which provision was later narrowly passed and vetoed by Bush. However, the bill in question contained other provisions to which McCain objected, and his spokesman stated: \"This wasn't a vote on waterboarding. This was a vote on applying the standards of the [Army] field manual to CIA personnel.\"[199]\nMeanwhile, McCain continued questioning the progress of the war in Iraq. In September 2005, he remarked upon Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Richard Myers' optimistic outlook on the war's progress: \"Things have not gone as well as we had planned or expected, nor as we were told by you, General Myers.\"[200] In August 2006, he criticized the administration for continually understating the effectiveness of the insurgency: \"We [have] not told the American people how tough and difficult this could be.\"[177] From the beginning, McCain strongly supported the Iraq troop surge of 2007.[201] The strategy's opponents labeled it \"McCain's plan\"[202] and University of Virginia political science professor Larry Sabato said, \"McCain owns Iraq just as much as Bush does now.\"[177] The surge and the war were unpopular during most of the year, even within the Republican Party,[203] as McCain's presidential campaign was underway; faced with the consequences, McCain frequently responded, \"I would much rather lose a campaign than a war.\"[204] In March 2008, McCain credited the surge strategy with reducing violence in Iraq, as he made his eighth trip to that country since the war began.[205]\nMcCain formally announced his intention to run for President of the United States on April 25, 2007, in Portsmouth, New Hampshire.[206] He stated that: \"I'm not running for president to be somebody, but to do something; to do the hard but necessary things, not the easy and needless things.\"[207]\nMcCain's oft-cited strengths as a presidential candidate for 2008 included national name recognition, sponsorship of major lobbying and campaign finance reform initiatives, his ability to reach across the aisle, his well-known military service and experience as a POW, his experience from the 2000 presidential campaign, and an expectation that he would capture Bush's top fundraisers.[208] During the 2006 election cycle, McCain had attended 346 events[64] and helped raise more than $10.5 million on behalf of Republican candidates. McCain also became more willing to ask business and industry for campaign contributions, while maintaining that such contributions would not affect any official decisions he would make.[209] Despite being considered the front-runner for the nomination by pundits as 2007 began,[210] McCain was in second place behind former Mayor of New York City Rudy Giuliani in national Republican polls as the year progressed.\nMcCain had fundraising problems in the first half of 2007, due in part to his support for the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2007, which was unpopular among the Republican base electorate.[211][212] Large-scale campaign staff downsizing took place in early July, but McCain said that he was not considering dropping out of the race.[212] Later that month, the candidate's campaign manager and campaign chief strategist both departed.[213] McCain slumped badly in national polls, often running third or fourth with 15 percent or less support.\nThe Arizona senator subsequently resumed his familiar position as a political underdog,[214] riding the Straight Talk Express and taking advantage of free media such as debates and sponsored events.[215] By December 2007, the Republican race was unsettled, with none of the top-tier candidates dominating the race and all of them possessing major vulnerabilities with different elements of the Republican base electorate.[216] McCain was showing a resurgence, in particular with renewed strength in New Hampshire—the scene of his 2000 triumph—and was bolstered further by the endorsements of The Boston Globe, the New Hampshire Union Leader, and almost two dozen other state newspapers,[217] as well as from Senator Lieberman (now an Independent Democrat).[218][219] McCain decided not to campaign significantly in the January 3, 2008, Iowa caucuses, which saw a win by former Governor of Arkansas Mike Huckabee.\nMcCain's comeback plan paid off when he won the New Hampshire primary on January 8, defeating former Governor of Massachusetts Mitt Romney in a close contest, to once again become one of the front-runners in the race.[220] In mid-January, McCain placed first in the South Carolina primary, narrowly defeating Mike Huckabee.[221] Pundits credited the third-place finisher, Tennessee's former U.S. Senator Fred Thompson, with drawing votes from Huckabee in South Carolina, thereby giving a narrow win to McCain.[222]\nA week later, McCain won the Florida primary,[223] beating Romney again in a close contest; Giuliani then dropped out and endorsed McCain.[224]\nOn February 5, McCain won both the majority of states and delegates in the Super Tuesday Republican primaries, giving him a commanding lead toward the Republican nomination. Romney departed from the race on February 7.[225] McCain's wins in the March 4 primaries clinched a majority of the delegates, and he became the presumptive Republican nominee.[226]\nHad he been elected, he would have become the first president physically born outside the United States. This raised a potential legal issue, since the United States Constitution requires the president to be a natural-born citizen of the United States. A bipartisan legal review,[227] and a unanimous but non-binding Senate resolution,[228] both concluded that he was a natural-born citizen. If inaugurated in 2009 at the age of 72 years and 144 days, he would have been the oldest person to become president.[229]\nMcCain addressed concerns about his age and past health issues, stating in 2005 that his health was \"excellent\".[230] He had been treated for melanoma and an operation in 2000 for that condition left a noticeable mark on the left side of his face.[231] McCain's prognosis appeared favorable, according to independent experts, especially because he had already survived without a recurrence for more than seven years.[231] In May 2008, McCain's campaign briefly let the press review his medical records, and he was described as appearing cancer-free, having a strong heart, and in general being in good health.[232]\nMcCain clinched enough delegates for the nomination and his focus shifted toward the general election, while Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton fought a prolonged battle for the Democratic nomination.[233] McCain introduced various policy proposals, and sought to improve his fundraising.[234][235] Cindy McCain, who accounted for most of the couple's wealth with an estimated net worth of $100 million,[75] made part of her tax returns public in May.[236] After facing criticism about lobbyists on staff, the McCain campaign issued new rules in May 2008 to avoid conflicts of interest, causing five top aides to leave.[237][238]\nWhen Obama became the Democrats' presumptive nominee in early June, McCain proposed joint town hall meetings, but Obama instead requested more traditional debates for the fall.[239] In July, a staff shake-up put Steve Schmidt in full operational control of the McCain campaign.[240] Rick Davis remained as campaign manager but with a reduced role. Davis had also managed McCain's 2000 presidential campaign; in 2005 and 2006, U.S. intelligence warned McCain's Senate staff about Davis's Russian links but gave no further warnings.[241][242][243][244]\nThroughout the summer of 2008, Obama typically led McCain in national polls by single-digit margins,[245] and also led in several key swing states.[246] McCain reprised his familiar underdog role, which was due at least in part to the overall challenges Republicans faced in the election year.[214][246] McCain accepted public financing for the general election campaign, and the restrictions that go with it, while criticizing his Democratic opponent for becoming the first major party candidate to opt out of such financing for the general election since the system was implemented in 1976.[247][248] The Republican's broad campaign theme focused on his experience and ability to lead, compared to Obama's.[249]\nOn August 29, 2008, McCain revealed Alaska Governor Sarah Palin as his surprise choice for a running mate.[250] McCain was only the second U.S. major-party presidential nominee (after Walter Mondale, who chose Geraldine Ferraro) to select a woman as his running mate and the first Republican to do so. On September 3, 2008, McCain and Palin became the Republican Party's presidential and vice presidential nominees at the 2008 Republican National Convention in Saint Paul, Minnesota. McCain surged ahead of Obama in national polls following the convention, as the Palin pick energized core Republican voters who had previously been wary of him.[251] However, by the campaign's own later admission, the rollout of Palin to the national media went poorly,[252] and voter reactions to Palin grew increasingly negative, especially among independents and other voters concerned about her qualifications.[253]\nMcCain's decision to choose Sarah Palin as his running mate was criticized; New York Times journalist David Brooks said that \"he took a disease that was running through the Republican party – anti-intellectualism, disrespect for facts – and he put it right at the centre of the party\".[254] Laura McGann in Vox says that McCain gave the \"reality TV politics\" and Tea Party movement more political legitimacy, as well as solidifying \"the Republican Party's comfort with a candidate who would say absurdities ... unleashing a political style and a values system that animated the Tea Party movement and laid the groundwork for a Trump presidency.\"[255] Although McCain later expressed regret for not choosing the independent Senator Joe Lieberman (who had previously been Al Gore's running mate in 2000, while still elected as a Democrat) as his VP candidate instead, he consistently defended Palin's performances at his events.[256]\nOn September 24, McCain said he was temporarily suspending his campaign activities, called on Obama to join him, and proposed delaying the first of the general election debates with Obama, in order to work on the proposed U.S. financial system bailout before Congress, which was targeted at addressing the subprime mortgage crisis and the financial crisis of 2007–2008.[257][258] McCain's intervention helped to give dissatisfied House Republicans an opportunity to propose changes to the plan that was otherwise close to agreement.[259][260] After Obama declined McCain's suspension suggestion, McCain went ahead with the debate on September 26.[261] On October 1, McCain voted in favor of a revised $700 billion rescue plan.[262] Another debate was held on October 7; like the first one, polls afterward suggested that Obama had won it.[263] A final presidential debate occurred on October 15.[264] Down the stretch, McCain was outspent by Obama by a four-to-one margin.[265]\nDuring and after the final debate, McCain compared Obama's proposed policies to socialism and often invoked \"Joe the Plumber\" as a symbol of American small business dreams that would be thwarted by an Obama presidency.[266][267] He barred using the Jeremiah Wright controversy in ads against Obama,[268] but the campaign did frequently criticize Obama regarding his purported relationship with Bill Ayers.[269] His rallies became increasingly vitriolic,[270] with attendees denigrating Obama and displaying a growing anti-Muslim and anti-African-American sentiment.[271] During a campaign rally in Minnesota, Gayle Quinnell, a McCain supporter, told him she did not trust Obama because \"he's an Arab\".[272] McCain replied, \"No ma'am. He's a decent family man, citizen, that I just happen to have disagreements with on fundamental issues.\"[271] McCain's response was considered one of the finer moments of the campaign and was still being viewed several years later as a marker for civility in American politics, particularly in light of the anti-Muslim and anti-immigrant animus of the Donald Trump presidency.[270][273] Meghan McCain said that she cannot \"go a day without someone bringing up (that) moment,\" and noted that at the time \"there were a lot of people really trying to get my dad to go (against Obama) with ... you're a Muslim, you're not an American aspect of that,\" but that her father had refused. \"I can remember thinking that it was a morally amazing and beautiful moment, but that maybe there would be people in the Republican Party that would be quite angry,\" she said.[274]\nThe election took place on November 4, and Barack Obama was declared the projected winner at about 11:00 pm Eastern Standard Time; McCain delivered his concession speech in Phoenix, Arizona about twenty minutes later.[275] In it, he noted the historic and special significance of Obama being elected the nation's first African American president.[275] In the end, McCain won 173 electoral votes to Obama's 365;[276] McCain failed to win most of the battleground states and lost some traditionally Republican ones.[277] McCain gained 46 percent of the nationwide popular vote, compared to Obama's 53 percent.[277]\nFollowing his defeat, McCain returned to the Senate amid varying views about what role he might play there.[278] In mid-November 2008 he met with President-elect Obama, and the two discussed issues they had commonality on.[279] Around the same time, McCain indicated that he intended to run for re-election to his Senate seat in 2010.[280] As the inauguration neared, Obama consulted with McCain on a variety of matters, to an extent rarely seen between a president-elect and his defeated rival,[281] and President Obama's inauguration speech contained an allusion to McCain's theme of finding a purpose greater than oneself.[282]\nNevertheless, McCain emerged as a leader of the Republican opposition to the Obama economic stimulus package of 2009, saying it incorporated federal policy changes that had nothing to do with near-term job creation and would expand the growing federal budget deficit.[283] McCain also voted against Obama's Supreme Court nomination of Sonia Sotomayor—saying that while undeniably qualified, \"I do not believe that she shares my belief in judicial restraint\"[284]—and by August 2009 was siding more often with his Republican Party on closely divided votes than ever before in his senatorial career.[285] McCain reasserted that the War in Afghanistan was winnable[286] and criticized Obama for a slow process in deciding whether to send additional U.S. troops there.[287]\nMcCain also harshly criticized Obama for scrapping construction of the U.S. missile defense complex in Poland, declined to enter negotiations over climate change legislation similar to what he had proposed in the past, and strongly opposed the Obama health care plan.[287][288] McCain led a successful filibuster of a measure that would allow repeal of the military's \"Don't ask, don't tell\" policy towards gays.[289] Factors involved in McCain's new direction included Senate staffers leaving, a renewed concern over national debt levels and the scope of federal government, a possible Republican primary challenge from conservatives in 2010, and McCain's campaign edge being slow to wear off.[287][288] As one longtime McCain advisor said, \"A lot of people, including me, thought he might be the Republican building bridges to the Obama Administration. But he's been more like the guy blowing up the bridges.\"[287]\nIn early 2010, a primary challenge from radio talk show host and former U.S. Congressman J. D. Hayworth materialized in the 2010 U.S. Senate election in Arizona and drew support from some but not all elements of the Tea Party movement.[290][291] With Hayworth using the campaign slogan \"The Consistent Conservative\", McCain said—despite his own past use of the term on a number of occasions[291][292]—\"I never considered myself a maverick. I consider myself a person who serves the people of Arizona to the best of his abilities.\"[293] The primary challenge coincided with McCain reversing or muting his stance on some issues such as the bank bailouts, closing of the Guantánamo Bay detention camp, campaign finance restrictions, and gays in the military.[290]\nWhen the health care plan, now called the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, passed Congress and became law in March 2010, McCain strongly opposed the landmark legislation not only on its merits but also on the way it had been handled in Congress. As a consequence, he warned that congressional Republicans would not work with Democrats on anything else: \"There will be no cooperation for the rest of the year. They have poisoned the well in what they've done and how they've done it.\"[294] McCain became a vocal defender of Arizona SB 1070, the April 2010 tough anti-illegal immigration state law that aroused national controversy, saying that the state had been forced to take action given the federal government's inability to control the border.[291][295] In the August 24 primary, McCain beat Hayworth by a 56 to 32 percent margin.[296] McCain proceeded to easily defeat Democratic Tucson city councilman Rodney Glassman in the general election.[297]\nIn the lame duck session of the 111th Congress, McCain voted for the compromise Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010,[298] but against the DREAM Act (which he had once sponsored) and the New START Treaty.[299] Most prominently, he continued to lead the eventually losing fight against \"Don't ask, don't tell\" repeal.[300] In his opposition, he sometimes fell into anger or hostility on the Senate floor, and called its passage \"a very sad day\" that would compromise the battle effectiveness of the military.[299][300]\nWhile control of the House of Representatives went over to the Republicans in the 112th Congress, the Senate stayed Democratic and McCain continued to be the ranking member of the Senate Armed Services Committee. As the Arab Spring took center stage, McCain urged that the embattled Egyptian president, Hosni Mubarak, step down and thought the U.S. should push for democratic reforms in the region despite the associated risks of religious extremists gaining power.[301] McCain was an especially vocal supporter of the 2011 military intervention in Libya. In April of that year he visited the Anti-Gaddafi forces and National Transitional Council in Benghazi, the highest-ranking American to do so, and said that the rebel forces were \"my heroes\".[302] In June, he joined with Senator Kerry in offering a resolution that would have authorized the military intervention, and said: \"The administration's disregard for the elected representatives of the American people on this matter has been troubling and counterproductive.\"[303][304] In August, McCain voted for the Budget Control Act of 2011 that resolved the U.S. debt ceiling crisis.[305] In November, McCain and Senator Carl Levin were leaders in efforts to codify in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012 that terrorism suspects, no matter where captured, could be detained by the U.S. military and its tribunal system; following objections by civil libertarians, some Democrats, and the White House, McCain and Levin agreed to language making it clear that the bill would not pertain to U.S. citizens.[306][307]\nIn the 2012 Republican Party presidential primaries, McCain endorsed former 2008 rival Mitt Romney and campaigned for him, but compared the contest to a Greek tragedy due to its drawn-out nature with massive super PAC-funded attack ads damaging all the contenders.[308] He labeled the Supreme Court's 2010 Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission decision as \"uninformed, arrogant, naïve\", and, decrying its effects and the future scandals he thought it would bring, said it would become considered the court's \"worst decision ... in the 21st century\".[309] McCain took the lead in opposing the defense spending sequestrations brought on by the Budget Control Act of 2011 and gained attention for defending State Department aide Huma Abedin against charges brought by a few House Republicans that she had ties to the Muslim Brotherhood.[310]\nMcCain continued to be one of the most frequently appearing guests on the Sunday morning news talk shows.[310]\nHe became one of the most vocal critics of the Obama administration's handling of the September 11, 2012, attack on the U.S. diplomatic mission in Benghazi, saying it was a \"debacle\" that featured either \"a massive cover-up or incompetence that is not acceptable\" and that it was worse than the Watergate scandal.[312] As an outgrowth of this strong opposition, he and a few other senators were successful in blocking the planned nomination of Ambassador to the UN Susan Rice to succeed Hillary Rodham Clinton as U.S. Secretary of State; McCain's friend and colleague John Kerry was nominated instead.[313]\nRegarding the Syrian civil war that had begun in 2011, McCain repeatedly argued for the U.S. intervening militarily in the conflict on the side of the anti-government forces. He staged a visit to rebel forces inside Syria in May 2013, the first senator to do so, and called for arming the Free Syrian Army with heavy weapons and for the establishment of a no-fly zone over the country. Following reports that two of the people he posed for pictures with had been responsible for the kidnapping of eleven Lebanese Shiite pilgrims the year before, McCain disputed one of the identifications and said he had not met directly with the other.[314] Following the 2013 Ghouta chemical weapons attack, McCain argued again for strong American military action against the government of the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad, and in September 2013 cast a Foreign Relations committee vote in favor of Obama's request to Congress that it authorize a military response.[315] McCain took the lead in criticizing a growing non-interventionist movement within the Republican Party, exemplified by his March 2013 comment that Senators Rand Paul and Ted Cruz and Representative Justin Amash were \"wacko birds\".[316]\nDuring 2013, McCain was a member of a bi-partisan group of senators, the \"Gang of Eight\", which announced principles for another try at comprehensive immigration reform.[317] The resulting Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act of 2013 passed the Senate by a 68–32 margin, but faced an uncertain future in the House.[318] In July 2013, McCain was at the forefront of an agreement among senators to drop filibusters against Obama administration executive nominees without Democrats resorting to the \"nuclear option\" that would disallow such filibusters altogether.[319][320] However, the option would be imposed later in the year anyway, to the senator's displeasure.[321] These developments and some other negotiations showed that McCain now had improved relations with the Obama administration, including the president himself, as well as with Democratic Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, and that he had become the leader of a power center in the Senate for cutting deals in an otherwise bitterly partisan environment.[322][323][324] They also led some observers to conclude that the \"maverick\" McCain had returned.[320][324]\nMcCain was publicly skeptical about the Republican strategy that precipitated the U.S. federal government shutdown of 2013 and U.S. debt-ceiling crisis of 2013 in order to defund or delay the Affordable Care Act; in October 2013 he voted in favor of the Continuing Appropriations Act, 2014, which resolved them and said, \"Republicans have to understand we have lost this battle, as I predicted weeks ago, that we would not be able to win because we were demanding something that was not achievable.\"[325] Similarly, he was one of nine Republican senators who voted for the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 at the end of the year.[326] By early 2014, McCain's apostasies were enough that the Arizona Republican Party formally censured him for having what they saw as a liberal record that had been \"disastrous and harmful\".[327] McCain remained stridently opposed to many aspects of Obama's foreign policy, however, and in June 2014, following major gains by the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant in the 2014 Northern Iraq offensive, decried what he saw as a U.S. failure to protect its past gains in Iraq and called on the president's entire national security team to resign. McCain said, \"Could all this have been avoided? ... The answer is absolutely yes. If I sound angry it's because I am angry.\"[328]\nMcCain was a supporter of the Euromaidan protests against Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych and his government, and appeared in Independence Square in Kyiv in December 2013.[329] Following the overthrow of Yanukovych and subsequent 2014 Russian military intervention in Ukraine, McCain became a vocal supporter of providing arms to Ukrainian military forces, saying the sanctions imposed against Russia were not enough.[330] In 2014, McCain led the opposition to the appointments of Colleen Bell, Noah Mamet, and George Tsunis to the ambassadorships in Hungary, Argentina, and Norway, respectively, arguing they were unqualified appointees being rewarded for their political fundraising.[331] Unlike many Republicans, McCain supported the release and contents of the Senate Intelligence Committee report on CIA torture in December 2014, saying \"The truth is sometimes a hard pill to swallow. It sometimes causes us difficulties at home and abroad. It is sometimes used by our enemies in attempts to hurt us. But the American people are entitled to it, nonetheless.\"[332] He added that the CIA's practices following the September 11 attacks had \"stained our national honor\" while doing \"much harm and little practical good\" and that \"Our enemies act without conscience. We must not.\"[333] He opposed the Obama administration's December 2014 decision to normalize relations with Cuba.[334]\nThe 114th United States Congress assembled in January 2015 with Republicans in control of the Senate, and McCain achieved one of his longtime goals when he became chairman of the Armed Services Committee.[335] In this position, he led the writing of proposed Senate legislation that sought to modify parts of the Goldwater-Nichols Act of 1986 in order to return responsibility for major weapons systems acquisition back to the individual armed services and their secretaries and away from the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics.[336] As chair, McCain tried to maintain a bipartisan approach and forged a good relationship with ranking member Jack Reed.[335] In April 2015, McCain announced that he would run for a sixth term in Arizona's 2016 Senate election.[337] While there was still conservative and Tea Party anger at him, it was unclear if they would mount an effective primary challenge against him.[338] During 2015, McCain strongly opposed the Obama administration's proposed comprehensive agreement on the Iranian nuclear program (later finalized as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA)), saying that Secretary of State Kerry was \"delusional\" and \"giv[ing] away the store\" in negotiations with Iran.[339] McCain supported the Saudi Arabian-led military intervention in Yemen against the Shia Houthis and forces loyal to former President Ali Abdullah Saleh,[340] saying: \"I'm sure civilians die in war. Not nearly as many as the Houthis have executed.\"[341]\nMcCain accused President Obama of being \"directly responsible\" for the Orlando nightclub shooting \"because when he pulled everybody out of Iraq, al-Qaeda went to Syria, became ISIS, and ISIS is what it is today thanks to Barack Obama's failures.\"[342][343]\nDuring the 2016 Republican primaries, McCain said he would support the Republican nominee even if it was Donald Trump, in spite of his personal disagreements with Trump.\nHowever, following Mitt Romney's 2016 anti-Trump speech, McCain endorsed the sentiments expressed in that speech, saying he had serious concerns about Trump's \"uninformed and indeed dangerous statements on national security issues\".[344] Relations between the two had been fraught since early in Trump's 2016 presidential campaign, when McCain referred to a room full of Trump supporters as \"crazies\", and the real estate mogul then said of McCain: \"He insulted me, and he insulted everyone in that room ... He is a war hero because he was captured. I like people who weren't captured ... perhaps he was a war hero, but right now he's said a lot of very bad things about a lot of people.\"[344][345] This was widely condemned by much of the Republican Party, with Senator Marco Rubio referring to Trump's comments as \"offensive rantings\", commentator Rick Santorum tweeting that \"@SenJohnMcCain is an American hero, period\", and Governor Scott Walker using the comments as the basis for his denunciation of Trump in a campaign event in Sioux City.[346] McCain also vocally opposed a federal loan guarantee for a development project Trump was contemplating on the West Side of Manhattan in 1996.[347] Following Trump becoming the presumptive nominee of the party on May 3, McCain said that Republican voters had spoken and he would support Trump.[348]\nMcCain himself faced a primary challenge from Kelli Ward, a fervent Trump supporter, and then was expected to face a potentially strong challenge from Democratic Congresswoman Ann Kirkpatrick in the general election.[349] The senator privately expressed worry over the effect that Trump's unpopularity among Hispanic voters might have on his own chances but also was concerned with more conservative pro-Trump voters; he thus kept his endorsement of Trump in place but tried to speak of him as little as possible given their disagreements.[350][351][352] However McCain defeated Ward in the primary by a double-digit percentage point margin and gained a similar lead over Kirkpatrick in general election polls, and when the Donald Trump Access Hollywood controversy broke, he felt secure enough to on October 8 withdraw his endorsement of Trump.[349] McCain stated that Trump's \"demeaning comments about women and his boasts about sexual assaults\" made it \"impossible to continue to offer even conditional support\" and added that he would not vote for Hillary Clinton, but would instead \"write in the name of some good conservative Republican who is qualified to be president.\"[353][354] McCain, at 80 years of age, went on to defeat Kirkpatrick, securing a sixth term as United States Senator from Arizona.[355]\nIn November 2016, McCain learned of the existence of a dossier regarding the Trump presidential campaign's links to Russia compiled by Christopher Steele. McCain sent a representative to gather more information, who obtained a copy of the dossier.[356] In December 2016, McCain passed on the dossier to FBI Director James Comey in a 1-on-1 meeting. McCain later wrote that he felt the dossier's \"allegations were disturbing\" but unverifiable by himself, so he let the FBI investigate.[357]\nOn December 31, 2016, in Tbilisi, Georgia, McCain stated that the United States should strengthen its sanctions against Russia.[358] One year later, on December 23, 2017, the State Department announced that the United States would provide Ukraine with \"enhanced defensive capabilities\".[359]\nMcCain chaired the January 5, 2017, hearing of the Senate Armed Services Committee where Republican and Democratic senators and intelligence officers, including James R. Clapper Jr., the Director of National Intelligence, Michael S. Rogers, the head of the National Security Agency and United States Cyber Command presented a \"united front\" that \"forcefully reaffirmed the conclusion that the Russian government used hacking and leaks to try to influence the presidential election.\"[361]\nIn June 2017, McCain voted to support President Trump's controversial arms deal with Saudi Arabia.[362][363]\nRepeal and replacement of Obamacare (the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act) was a centerpiece of McCain's 2016 re-election campaign,[364] and in July 2017, he said, \"Have no doubt: Congress must replace Obamacare, which has hit Arizonans with some of the highest premium increases in the nation and left 14 of Arizona's 15 counties with only one provider option on the exchanges this year.\" He added that he supports affordable and quality health care, but objected that the pending Senate bill did not do enough to shield the Medicaid system in Arizona.[365]\nIn response to the death of Chinese Nobel Peace Prize laureate Liu Xiaobo, who died of organ failure while in government custody, McCain said that \"this is only the latest example of Communist China's assault on human rights, democracy, and freedom.\"[366]\nIn September 2017, as the Rohingya crisis in Myanmar became ethnic cleansing of the Rohingya Muslim minority, McCain announced moves to scrap planned future military cooperation with Myanmar.[367]\nIn October 2017, McCain praised President Trump's decision to decertify Iran's compliance with the Iran nuclear deal (JCPOA) while not yet withdrawing the U.S. from the agreement, saying that the Obama-era policy failed \"to meet the multifaceted threat Iran poses. The goals President Trump presented in his speech today are a welcomed long overdue change.\"[368]\nOn July 14, 2017, McCain underwent a minimally invasive craniotomy at Mayo Clinic Hospital in Phoenix, Arizona, in order to remove a blood clot above his left eye. His absence prompted Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to delay a vote on the Better Care Reconciliation Act.[369] Five days later, Mayo Clinic doctors announced that the laboratory results from the surgery confirmed the presence of a glioblastoma, which is a very aggressive cancerous brain tumor.[370] Standard treatment options for this tumor include chemotherapy and radiation, although even with treatment, average survival time is approximately 14 months.[370] McCain was a survivor of previous cancers, including melanoma.[231][371]\nPresident Donald Trump publicly wished Senator McCain well,[372] as did many others, including former President Obama.[373] On July 19, McCain's senatorial office issued a statement that he \"appreciates the outpouring of support he has received over the last few days. He is in good spirits as he continues to recover at home with his family in Arizona. He is grateful to the doctors and staff at Mayo Clinic for their outstanding care, and is confident that any future treatment will be effective.\" On July 24, McCain announced via Twitter that he would return to the United States Senate the following day.[374]\nMcCain returned to the Senate on July 25, less than two weeks after brain surgery. He cast a deciding vote allowing the Senate to begin consideration of bills to replace the Affordable Care Act. Along with that vote, he delivered a speech criticizing the party-line voting process used by the Republicans, as well as by the Democrats in passing the Affordable Care Act to begin with, and McCain also urged a \"return to regular order\" utilizing the usual committee hearings and deliberations.[375][376][377] On July 28, he cast the decisive vote against the Republicans' final proposal that month, the so-called \"skinny repeal\" option, which failed 49–51.[378] McCain supported the passage  of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.\nMcCain did not vote in the Senate after December 2017, remaining instead in Arizona to undergo cancer treatment. On April 15, 2018, he underwent surgery for an infection relating to diverticulitis and the following day was reported to be in stable condition.[379]\nOn August 24, 2018, McCain's family announced that he would no longer receive treatment for his cancer.[382] He died the following day at 4:28 p.m. MST (23:28 UTC), with his wife and family beside him, at his home in Cornville, Arizona.[383][384]\nMcCain lay in state in the Arizona State Capitol in Phoenix on August 29, which would have been his 82nd birthday. This was followed by a service at North Phoenix Baptist Church on August 30. His remains were then moved to Washington, D.C. to lie in state in the rotunda of the United States Capitol[385] on August 31, which was followed by a service at the Washington National Cathedral on September 1. He was a \"lifelong Episcopalian\" who attended, but did not join, a Southern Baptist church for at least 17 years; memorial services were scheduled in both denominations.[386][387] Prior to his death, McCain requested that former Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama deliver eulogies at his funeral, and asked that both President Donald Trump and former Alaska Governor and 2008 vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin not attend any of the services.[388][389] McCain himself planned the funeral arrangements and selected his pallbearers for the service in Washington; the pallbearers included former Vice President Joe Biden, former Wisconsin Senator Russ Feingold, former Secretary of Defense William Cohen, actor Warren Beatty, and Russian dissident Vladimir Vladimirovich Kara-Murza.[390]\nMultiple foreign leaders attended McCain's service: Secretary General of NATO Jens Stoltenberg, President of Ukraine Petro Poroshenko, Speaker of Taiwan's Congress Su Jia-chyuan, National Defense Minister of Canada Harjit Sajjan, Defense Minister Jüri Luik and Foreign Minister Sven Mikser of Estonia, Foreign Minister of Latvia Edgars Rinkēvičs, Foreign Minister of Lithuania Linas Antanas Linkevičius, and Foreign Affairs Minister of Saudi Arabia Adel al-Jubeir.[391][392][393]\nDignitaries who gave eulogies at the Memorial Service in Washington National Cathedral included Barack Obama, George W. Bush, Henry Kissinger, Joe Lieberman, and his daughter Meghan McCain. The New Yorker described the service as the biggest meeting of anti-Trump figures during his presidency.[394]\nMany American political figures paid tribute at the funeral. Those who attended included former United States Presidents Obama, Bush, Clinton, Carter; First Ladies Michelle, Laura, Hillary, Rosalyn; and former Vice Presidents Biden, Cheney, Gore, and Quayle. Former President George H. W. Bush (who died 3 months and 5 days after McCain) was too ill to attend the service, and President Trump was not invited. Many figures from political life, both current and former and from both political parties, attended. Figures included John F. Kelly, Jim Mattis, Bob Dole, Madeleine Albright, John Kerry, Mitch McConnell, Paul Ryan, Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer, Mitt Romney, Lindsey Graham, Jeff Flake, Elizabeth Warren, and Jon Huntsman. President Trump's daughter and son-in-law Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner attended to the displeasure of Meghan McCain.[395] Journalists Carl Bernstein, Tom Brokaw, and Charlie Rose, as well as actors Warren Beatty and Annette Bening and comedians Jay Leno and Joy Behar also attended the funeral.[396]\nOn September 2, the funeral cortege traveled from Washington, D.C. through Annapolis, Maryland, where the streets were lined with crowds of onlookers, to the Naval Academy.[397] A private service was held at the Naval Academy Chapel, attended by the brigade of midshipmen and McCain's classmates. After the chapel service, McCain was buried at the United States Naval Academy Cemetery, next to his Naval Academy classmate and lifelong friend Admiral Charles R. Larson.[398]\nMany celebrities paid tribute to the late Senator on Twitter. Those included Tom Hanks, Whoopi Goldberg, Ellen DeGeneres, Reese Witherspoon, Jimmy Kimmel, and Khloe Kardashian.[399]\nArizona Governor Doug Ducey was empowered to appoint McCain's interim replacement until a special election is held in 2020 to determine who is to serve out the remainder of McCain's term, which ends in January 2023 and thus appointed the then former Arizona U.S. Senator Jon Kyl to fill the vacancy.[400][401] Under Arizona law, the appointed replacement must be of the same party as McCain, a Republican.[402] Newspaper speculation about potential appointees has included McCain's widow Cindy, former Senator Jon Kyl, and former Representatives Matt Salmon and John Shadegg.[403][404] Ducey said that he would not make a formal appointment until after McCain's final funeral and burial; on September 4, two days after McCain was buried, Ducey appointed Kyl to fill McCain's seat.[405][406]\nMcCain received many tributes and condolences, including from Congressional colleagues, all living former presidents – Jimmy Carter, George H. W. Bush, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, Barack Obama – and future president Joe Biden, as well as Vice President Mike Pence and President Richard Nixon's daughters Tricia Nixon Cox and Julie Nixon Eisenhower.[407][408][409][410] French President Emmanuel Macron, Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko and Prime Minister Volodymyr Groysman, Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison, who had just taken office the previous day, and former Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, British Prime Minister Theresa May and former Prime Minister David Cameron, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and former Prime Minister Stephen Harper, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and foreign minister Heiko Maas, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Afghanistan chief executive Abdullah Abdullah, Pakistani foreign minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi, the 14th Dalai Lama, and former Vietnamese ambassador to Washington Nguyễn Quốc Cường also sent condolences.[411][412][413][414][415][416]\nColonel Trần Trọng Duyệt, who ran the Hỏa Lò Prison when McCain was held there, remarked, \"At that time I liked him personally for his toughness and strong stance. Later on, when he became a US Senator, he and Senator John Kerry greatly contributed to promote Vietnam-US relations so I was very fond of him. When I learnt about his death early this morning, I feel very sad. I would like to send condolences to his family.\"[417] In a TV interview, Senator Lindsey Graham said McCain's last words to him were \"I love you, I have not been cheated.\"[418] His daughter, Meghan McCain, shared her grief, stating that she was present at the moment he died.[419]\nAt the 70th Primetime Emmy Awards, McCain was recognized in the \"In Memoriam\" segment, right before Aretha Franklin. Many fans questioned the inclusion of McCain in the segment because he wasn't known for television. He had, however, appeared in various television projects, including hosting and several cameo appearances on Saturday Night Live. He also made appearances on Parks and Recreation and 24.[420]\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) announced that he would introduce a resolution to rename the Russell Senate Office Building after McCain.[421] A quarter peal of Grandsire Caters in memory of McCain was rung by the bellringers of Washington National Cathedral the day following his death.[422] Another memorial quarter peal was rung on September 6 on the Bells of Congress at the Old Post Office in Washington.[423]\nPresident Trump reportedly rejected the White House's plans to release a statement praising McCain's life, and he initially said nothing about McCain himself in a tweet that extended condolences to McCain's family.[424] In addition, the flag at the White House, which had been lowered to half-staff the day of McCain's death (August 25), was raised back to full-staff at 12:01 a.m. on August 27.[425] Trump reportedly felt that media coverage of McCain's death was excessive given that McCain was never president.[426] In contrast with the White House's initial decision, many governors, both Democratic and Republican, had ordered flags in their states to fly at half-staff until McCain's interment, and Senate leaders Mitch McConnell and Chuck Schumer requested support from the Defense Department so that flags would be flown at half-staff on all government buildings.[427][428] Following public backlash from the American Legion and AMVETS, Trump relented and ordered the White House flag back to half-staff later in the day on August 27. Trump belatedly issued a statement praising McCain's service to the country, and he signed a proclamation ordering flags to be flown at half-staff until McCain's interment at the Naval Academy Cemetery.[429][430]\nIn March 2019—seven months after McCain's death—Trump issued a series of public statements that criticized McCain at least four times in five days.[431] Trump also claimed that he approved McCain's funeral but was not thanked for it. However, the Washington National Cathedral responded that no governmental or presidential approval was needed for McCain's funeral because he was not a former president. McCain's lying in state was approved by the Senate, while Trump did approve the transport for McCain's body.[432][433][434] Trump also described himself as having \"got the job done\" on the Veterans Choice Act while claiming McCain failed on the same issue. However, McCain was actually one of the two main authors of the bill, which President Barack Obama signed into law in 2014. Trump had signed the VA MISSION Act of 2018 (S. 2372), an expansion of that law worked on by McCain that includes McCain's name in its full title. Trump also claimed that McCain graduated \"last in his class\", though McCain was actually fifth from last.[435][436]\nVarious advocacy groups have given McCain scores or grades as to how well his votes align with the positions of each group.[438] CrowdPac, which rates politicians based on donations made and received, gave Senator McCain a score of 4.3C with 10C being the most conservative and 10L being the most liberal.[439]\nThe non-partisan National Journal rates a Senator's votes by what percentage of the Senate voted more liberally than him or her, and what percentage more conservatively, in three policy areas: economic, social, and foreign. For 2005–2006 (as reported in the 2008 Almanac of American Politics), McCain's average ratings were as follows: economic policy: 59 percent conservative and 41 percent liberal; social policy: 54 percent conservative and 38 percent liberal; and foreign policy: 56 percent conservative and 43 percent liberal.[440] In 2012, the National Journal gave McCain a composite score of 73 percent conservative and 27 percent liberal,[441] while in 2013 he received a composite score of 60 percent conservative and 40 percent liberal.[442]\nColumnists such as Robert Robb and Matthew Continetti used a formulation devised by William F. Buckley Jr. to describe McCain as \"conservative\" but not \"a conservative\", meaning that while McCain usually tended towards conservative positions, he was not \"anchored by the philosophical tenets of modern American conservatism\".[443][444] Following his 2008 presidential election loss, McCain began adopting more orthodox conservative views; the magazine National Journal rated McCain along with seven of his colleagues as the \"most conservative\" Senators for 2010[445] and he achieved his first 100 percent rating from the American Conservative Union for that year.[437] During Barack Obama's presidency, McCain was one of the top five Republicans most likely to vote with Obama's position on significant votes; McCain voted with Obama's position on such votes more than half the time in 2013 and was \"censured by the Arizona Republican party for a so-called 'liberal' voting record\".[446]\nFrom the late 1990s until 2008, McCain was a board member of Project Vote Smart which was set up by Richard Kimball, his 1986 Senate opponent.[447] The project provides non-partisan information about the political positions of McCain[448] and other candidates for political office. Additionally, McCain used his Senate website to describe his political positions.[449]\nIn his 2008 speech to the CPAC McCain stated that he believed in \"small government; fiscal discipline; low taxes; a strong defense, judges who enforce, and not make, our laws; the social values that are the true source of our strength; and, generally, the steadfast defense of our rights to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness, which I have defended my entire career as God-given to the born and unborn.\"\nIn his 2018 memoir The Restless Wave, McCain described his views as such: \"Last but not least, I was [at the time of entering Congress] a Republican, a Reagan Republican. Still am. Not a Tea Party Republican. Not a Breitbart Republican. Not a talk radio or Fox News Republican. Not an isolationist, protectionist, immigrant-bashing, scapegoating, get-nothing-useful-done Republican. Not, as I am often dismissed by self-declared 'real' conservatives, a RINO, Republican in Name Only. I'm a Reagan Republican, a proponent of lower taxes, less government, free markets, free trade, defense readiness, and democratic internationalism.\"\nMcCain's personal character was a dominant feature of his public image.[451] This image includes the military service of both himself and his family,[452] the circumstances and tensions surrounding the end of his first marriage and beginning of second,[29] his maverick political persona,[123] his temper,[453] his admitted problem of occasional ill-considered remarks,[97] and his close ties to his children from both his marriages.[29]\nMcCain's political appeal was more nonpartisan and less ideological compared to many other national politicians.[454] His stature and reputation stemmed partly from his service in the Vietnam War.[455] He also carried physical vestiges of his war wounds, as well as his melanoma surgery.[456] When campaigning, he quipped: \"I am older than dirt and have more scars than Frankenstein.\"[457]\nWriters often extolled McCain for his courage not just in war but in politics, and wrote sympathetically about him.[64][451][455][458] McCain's shift of political stances and attitudes during and especially after the 2008 presidential campaign, including his self-repudiation of the maverick label, left many writers expressing sadness and wondering what had happened to the McCain they thought they had known.[459][460][461][462] By 2013, some aspects of the older McCain had returned, and his image became that of a kaleidoscope of contradictory tendencies, including as a Republican In Name Only or a \"traitor\" to his party [463] and, as one writer listed, \"the maverick, the former maverick, the curmudgeon, the bridge builder, the war hero bent on transcending the call of self-interest to serve a cause greater than himself, the sore loser, old bull, last lion, loose cannon, happy warrior, elder statesman, lion in winter.\"[321]\nIn his own estimation, McCain was straightforward and direct, but impatient.[464] His other traits included a penchant for lucky charms,[465] a fondness for hiking,[466] and a sense of humor that sometimes backfired spectacularly, as when he made a joke in 1998 about the Clintons that was widely deemed not fit to print in newspapers: \"Do you know why Chelsea Clinton is so ugly? – Because Janet Reno is her father.\"[467][468] McCain subsequently apologized profusely,[469] and the Clinton White House accepted his apology.[470] McCain did not shy away from addressing his shortcomings, and he apologized for them.[97][471] He was known for sometimes being prickly[472] and hot-tempered[473] with Senate colleagues, but his relations with his own Senate staff were more cordial, and inspired loyalty towards him.[474][475] He formed a strong bond with two senators, Joe Lieberman and Lindsey Graham, over hawkish foreign policy and overseas travel, and they became dubbed the \"Three Amigos\".[311]\nMcCain acknowledged having said intemperate things in years past,[476] though he also said that many stories have been exaggerated.[477] One psychoanalytic comparison suggested that McCain was not the first presidential candidate to have a temper,[478] and cultural critic Julia Keller argued that voters want leaders who are passionate, engaged, fiery, and feisty.[453] McCain employed both profanity[479] and shouting on occasion, although such incidents became less frequent over the years.[480][481] Lieberman made this observation: \"It is not the kind of anger that is a loss of control. He is a very controlled person.\"[480] Senator Thad Cochran, who knew McCain for decades and had battled him over earmarks,[482][483] expressed concern about a McCain presidency: \"He is erratic. He is hotheaded. He loses his temper and he worries me.\"[480] Yet Cochran supported McCain for president when it was clear he would win the nomination.[484] The Chicago Tribune editorial board called McCain a patriot, who although sometimes wrong was fearless, and that he deserves to be thought of among the few US senators in history, whose names are more recognizable than some presidents.[485]\nAll McCain's family members were on good terms with him,[29] and he defended them against some of the negative consequences of his high-profile political lifestyle.[486][487] His family's military tradition extends to the latest generation: son John Sidney IV (\"Jack\") graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy in 2009, becoming the fourth generation John S. McCain to do so, and is a helicopter pilot; son James served two tours with the Marines in the Iraq War; and son Doug flew jets in the navy.[29][488][489] His daughter Meghan became a blogging and Twittering presence in the debate about the future of the Republican Party following the 2008 elections, and showed some of his maverick tendencies.[490][491] In 2017 Meghan joined the cast of the popular ABC talk show The View as a co-host.[492] Senator McCain himself also appeared as a guest on the program.[493]\nMcCain appeared in several television shows and films while he was a sitting senator. He made uncredited cameo appearances in Wedding Crashers and 24 and had two uncredited cameos in Parks and Recreation. McCain also hosted Saturday Night Live in 2002 and appeared in two episodes in 2008.[494]\nIn addition to his military honors and decorations, McCain was granted a number of civilian awards and honors.\nIn 1997, Time magazine named McCain as one of the \"25 Most Influential People in America\".[131]\nIn 1999, McCain shared the Profile in Courage Award with Senator Russ Feingold for their work towards campaign finance reform.[135] The following year, the same pair shared the Paul H. Douglas Award for Ethics in Government.[495] In 2005, The Eisenhower Institute awarded McCain the Eisenhower Leadership Prize.[496] The prize recognizes individuals whose lifetime accomplishments reflect Dwight D. Eisenhower's legacy of integrity and leadership. In 2006, the Bruce F. Vento Public Service Award was bestowed upon McCain by the National Park Trust.[497] The same year, McCain was awarded the Henry M. Jackson Distinguished Service Award by the Jewish Institute for National Security Affairs, in honor of Senator Henry M. \"Scoop\" Jackson.[498] In 2007, the World Leadership Forum presented McCain with the Policymaker of the Year Award; it is given internationally to someone who has \"created, inspired or strongly influenced important policy or legislation\".[499] In 2010, President Mikheil Saakashvili of Georgia awarded McCain the Order of National Hero, an award never previously given to a non-Georgian.[500] In 2015, the Kyiv Patriarchate awarded McCain its own version of the Order of St. Vladimir.[501] In 2016, Allegheny College awarded McCain, along with Vice President Joe Biden, its Prize for Civility in Public Life.[502] In August 2016, Petro Poroshenko, the President of Ukraine, awarded McCain with the highest award for foreigners, the Order of Liberty.[503] In 2017, Hashim Thaçi, the President of Kosovo, awarded McCain the \"Urdhër i Lirisë\" (Order of Freedom) medal for his contribution to the freedom and independence of Kosovo, and its partnership with the U.S.[504] McCain also received the Liberty Medal from the National Constitution Center in 2017.[505] In the spring of 2018 McCain was decorated with the Grand Cordon of the Order of the Rising Sun from the Japanese Emperor for 'strengthening bilateral relations and promoting friendship between Japan and the United States'.[506]\nMcCain received several honorary degrees from colleges and universities in the United States and internationally. These include ones from Colgate University (LL.D 2000),[507] The Citadel (DPA 2002),[508] Wake Forest University (LL.D May 20, 2002),[509][510] the University of Southern California (DHL May 2004),[511] Northwestern University (LL.D June 17, 2005),[512][513] Liberty University (2006),[514] The New School (2006),[515] and the Royal Military College of Canada (D.MSc June 27, 2013).[516][517][518] He was also made an Honorary Patron of the University Philosophical Society at Trinity College Dublin in 2005.[519]\nOn July 11, 2018, USS John S. McCain, originally named in honor of the Senator's father and grandfather, was rededicated in the Senator's name also.[520][521]\nOn November 29, 2017, the Phoenix City Council unanimously voted to name Terminal 3 at Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport in Honor of the Senator which opened on January 7, 2019, after his death in August 2018.[522]\nOn April 4, 2019, the Kyiv City Council renamed a street that had previously been named after the NKVD agent Ivan Kudria to \"John McCain Street\".[523][524][525]",

            "report_content": "Support Intelligent, In-Depth, Trustworthy Journalism.\nSen. John McCain, an Arizona Republican and two-time presidential candidate whose military service, foreign policy gravitas and occasional aversion to party politics made him one of the most influential lawmakers of this generation, has died. He was 81.\nMcCain’s life in public service spanned six decades and included a career in the Navy, five-and-a-half brutal years as a Vietnam prisoner of war, two terms in the House and six terms in the Senate.\nHe had been undergoing treatment since July 2017 for glioblastoma, an aggressive form of brain cancer. It is the same form of cancer that took the life of another Senate stalwart, the late Massachusetts Sen. Ted Kennedy, in 2009.\nMcCain initially kept a busy work schedule after his diagnosis. In July 2017, weeks after announcing that he had cancer, McCain made a dramatic appearance on the Senate floor to vote against a Republican plan to repeal the Affordable Care Act. His “no” vote helped sink the bill and was an act of political independence that infuriated his GOP senate colleagues and President Donald Trump. But there were signs in recent months that his health was declining.\nLast November, he was seen on Capitol Hill using a walking boot — and later, a wheelchair — after sustaining what his office said was a minor tear in his Achilles tendon. The following month, he was in Arizona, not Washington, as his Senate Republican colleagues pushed the final version of major tax legislation through the chamber. And in April, he underwent surgery for an intestinal infection. On Aug. 24, his family announced he was no longer seeking treatment for his cancer, saying “the progress of disease and the inexorable advance of age render their verdict.” He died the next day.\nSen. John McCain speaks to reporters as he arrives for a vote on Capitol Hill in Washington,D.C.. REUTERS/Joshua Roberts\nEven as his condition worsened, McCain stuck to the “maverick” persona he cultivated earlier in his political career, a label he embraced and used as a selling point to voters during his campaign for president in 2008.\n“Sometimes it’s meant as a compliment, sometimes it’s not,” McCain said as he accepted the GOP’s presidential nomination at the 2008 Republican National Convention, referring to the maverick reputation. “What it really means is, I understand who I work for. I don’t work for a party. I don’t work for a special interest. I don’t work for myself. I work for you.”\nMcCain in many ways represented a dying breed in the Senate: a member with the experience, stature and willingness to forge lasting relationships across the aisle. McCain partnered with then-Sen. Russ Feingold, a Wisconsin Democrat, on his signature legislative achievement, a campaign finance overhaul that became law in 2002. McCain was also part of two failed bipartisan efforts to pass comprehensive immigration legislation.\nIn the final months of his life, a steady stream of Republicans and Democrats made the pilgrimage to his ranch in Arizona to pay their final respects. They included Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, a close friend of McCain’s, and former Vice President Joe Biden, a Democrat who for years before the White House served with McCain in the Senate.\n“He was a great fire who burned bright, and we lived in his light and warmth for so very long. We know that his flame lives on, in each of us,” his daughter Meghan tweeted Saturday.\n“He passed the way he lived, on his own terms, surrounded by the people he loved, in the the place he loved best,” McCain’s wife Cindy tweeted after the news of his death.\nThe outpouring of public condolences since McCain’s death — including from President Donald Trump, who tweeted his “deepest sympathies and respect” to McCain’s family Saturday — speaks to a lengthy political career that stretched back nearly four decades. McCain’s congressional tenure coincided with broad economic and political changes in the country and within the Republican Party, which transitioned during his time in Washington from a party defined by the traditional conservatism of the Reagan era to one led by a populist, unorthodox outsider in Trump.\nMcCain’s final years in politics were defined by his opposition to the president. During his 2016 presidential campaign, Trump criticized McCain’s status as a war hero, and the veteran senator never seemed to forget it. McCain was a frequent and vocal critic of Trump’s policies and rhetoric, including in his latest book, “The Restless Wave,” which was published in May.\n“The appearance of toughness or a reality show facsimile of toughness seems to matter more than any of our values,” McCain wrote.\nBut politics was McCain’s second calling. Before he was a politician, he was a Navy pilot, and during his time in the military he confronted some of war’s worst horrors firsthand. The year 1967 was especially dark: He survived a deadly fire at sea only to be taken prisoner by North Vietnam a few months later, an experience that would help mold his political views and solidify his dedication to public service.\nJohn Sidney McCain III was born on Aug. 29, 1936, on an American military base in the Panama Canal Zone, where his parents — Roberta McCain and John Sidney McCain, Jr. — were stationed. McCain’s father, a Navy officer at the time, rose to the rank of admiral by the late 1960s and eventually assumed command of U.S. forces in the Pacific. McCain’s grandfather, John Sidney McCain, Sr., was promoted to admiral posthumously after commanding a naval battle group in the Pacific during World War II.\nChildhood in his Navy family meant moving from school to school. But after spending some of his teenage years at an all-boys boarding school outside Washington, D.C., McCain set off — like his father and grandfather before him — for the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland.\nThe senior McCains went on to become admirals, but the late Robert Timberg, a McCain biographer, has noted that they were among the lower-ranking midshipmen in their respective classes at the academy. In this respect, McCain also followed suit: He graduated fifth from the bottom of his class in 1958 before moving on to become a Navy pilot.\nMcCain’s Navy career eventually put him in the middle of the Vietnam War. He was aboard the U.S.S. Forrestal on July 29, 1967, the day a rocket accidentally fired on the deck of the aircraft carrier while it was in the Gulf of Tonkin, setting off a chain reaction that caused the Forrestal to go up in flames. The fire and explosions on board killed more than 130 servicemembers, and the accident remains one of the worst American naval disasters of the last several decades.\nMcCain was injured aboard the Forrestal, but was in the air again that October, taking off on a bombing mission from a different vessel, the U.S.S. Oriskany.\nIn a firsthand account that was published in a May 1973 issue of U.S. News & World Report, McCain recalled how a “missile the size of a telephone pole” blew apart the right wing of his A-4 Skyhawk bomber. McCain ejected from his stricken plane and landed in a lake near Hanoi, where he was pulled out, beaten and captured as a prisoner of war.\nA photo taken in 1967 shows US Navy Airforce Major John McCain being examined by a Vietnamese doctor in Hanoi. (AFP/Getty Images)\nIt was the beginning of a brutal ordeal that lasted more than five years. In that time, McCain endured beatings, torture and solitary confinement, especially early on during his captivity. Still, around the time his father took charge of the Pacific Command, in the summer of 1968, McCain defied his North Vietnamese captors and refused their offers of early release, because it would have meant being released ahead of other U.S. service members who were captured before him.\nFreedom for McCain did not come until March 14, 1973. “We had been peaked up so many times before,” McCain wrote in his U.S. News account that year, “that I had decided that I wouldn’t get excited until I shook hands with an American in uniform. That happened at Gia Lam, and then I knew it was over.”\n“There is no way I can describe how I felt as I walked toward that U.S. Air Force plane,” he recalled.\nMcCain took time to heal after he returned home, but his recovery would be never be complete. Later in life, McCain still had difficulty raising his arms above his head, which helped account for his go-to gesture on the campaign trail: both arms outstretched, at shoulder height, hands waving stiffly at supporters. As he dealt with his lingering injuries, McCain delved into studies at the National War College in Washington. Around that time, in the late 1970s, he also got his first glimpse of politics while working as the Navy liaison to the U.S. Senate.\nThere were changes in McCain’s personal life during that period as well. In 1980, he divorced his wife of 14 years, Carol Shepp, with whom he had a daughter, Sidney. Not long after, McCain married Cindy Lou Hensley, the daughter of a wealthy beer distributor. And in 1981 McCain retired from the Navy, giving up the chance to earn his own admiral’s stars.\nIt was all politics from there. In the 1982 midterm elections, McCain, who had moved by then with his family to Arizona, won a race to replace a retiring Phoenix-area congressman. Four years later, Arizona elected him to the Senate to replace another retiring politician, Barry Goldwater, a former Republican presidential nominee and conservative titan from an earlier era.\nMcCain’s rise in American politics was swift. A New York Times story from August 1988 called the freshman senator “the Senate’s young man in a hurry.” But he would soon be entangled in an influence-peddling scandal, the shadow of which presented McCain’s young political career with its first serious challenge.\nMcCain was among the “Keating Five” senators who came under investigation by the Senate Ethics Committee for their ties to Charles Keating, a bank executive and prominent political donor. The five senators had met with a federal regulator who was probing Keating’s bank, Lincoln Savings & Loan, which eventually failed during the so-called “savings and loan” crisis of the late 1980s and early 1990s.\nJohn McCain, left, with Senator John Kerry and President George H.W. Bush at the White House in 1992. Photo by REUTERS/Mike Theiler\nThe lengthy congressional investigation included multiple public hearings, which McCain, the lone Republican among the “Keating Five,” later called “a public humiliation.” In the end investigators cleared McCain, though they issued him a lesser reprimand for “poor judgment.” (They handed down harsher rebukes to some of the other “Keating Five” senators.)\nStill, the brush with scandal left a deep impression on McCain, who wrote about the investigation in “Worth the Fighting For,” the 2002 book he co-wrote with speechwriter Mark Salter, who also co-wrote McCain’s new memoir.\n“I still wince thinking about it,” McCain wrote, “and find that if I do not repress the memory, its recollection still provokes a vague but real feeling that I had lost something very important, something that was sacrificed in the pursuit of gratifying ambitions, my own and others’, and that I might never possess again as assuredly as I once had.”\nWhatever his feelings, McCain worked hard at the time to put the scandal behind him. His profile rose during the First Gulf War and in the years that followed, as he carved out a niche in the Senate as an expert on military and foreign affairs. On domestic policy, McCain staked out a hawkish stance on government spending. He also became a leading advocate for campaign finance reform, a cause that helped McCain position himself as a foe of business-as-usual politics in Washington.\nEventually, those priorities would double as themes for a national campaign.\nCandidate McCain\nMcCain ran as an anti-establishment candidate in the 2000 GOP presidential primaries, pitching himself to voters as a moderate Republican who was willing to challenge the political status quo. But he faced serious headwinds from the start. Republican Party leaders and donors largely lined up behind McCain’s main opponent, then-Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the son of a former president and a talented retail politician who was viewed by many on the right as the party’s best hope of recapturing the White House.\nBush and his campaign, flush with cash, touted his experience running one of the country’s biggest states. Bush also highlighted his faith and conservative social values at a time when many Republicans were eager to elect someone who could stand in sharp contrast to Bill Clinton, the outgoing Democratic president, whose presidency had been nearly derailed by a sex scandal.\nDespite his underdog status, McCain gained traction in New Hampshire, the site of the year’s first primary. He dubbed his campaign bus “The Straight Talk Express,” and promised as much as he rode from town hall to town hall.\nMcCain, pictured with his wife Cindy arriving at an event in Raymond, New Hampshire on Jan. 29, 2000. (KL/JP)\n“I am speaking plainly,” he told voters at one Rotary Club meeting there. “And I’m not going to do anything that, at the end of this campaign, if you vote for me, that you will say, ‘Gee, McCain told me something there at the Rotary Club in New Hampshire, and he was down in South Carolina and said something else. And then he was in California and said something else.’”\n“In other words,” he continued, “I’m not going to disappoint you.”\nMcCain surprised the political world by beating Bush easily in New Hampshire.  As he celebrated that night with supporters, McCain hailed his win as “a powerful message to Washington that change is coming.”\nHis momentum was stymied soon afterwards, however, as the primary race turned to South Carolina and the Bush campaign stepped up its criticism of McCain with a flurry of attack ads.  McCain also became the target of a racist, unsubstantiated rumor that he had a black child out of wedlock. The rumor was spread through phone calls to voters where they were asked if they would support McCain if they knew he had an illegitimate black child. It took hold with Republicans in the state even though all four of the children John and Cindy McCain had together — daughters Meghan and Bridgette, who was adopted from Bangladesh, and sons Jack and Jimmy — appeared on the campaign trail with their father. (Bush campaign officials have denied that they were behind the attack.)\nRegardless of who was responsible, the damage was done. Voters in South Carolina’s Republican primary ended up siding with Bush over McCain. Despite McCain’s defiant primary night remarks to supporters — “I will not take the low road to the highest office in this land,” he vowed — his campaign never recovered. It folded weeks later.\nReturn to the Senate\nIt was Bush’s Republican National Convention that summer. And McCain, on the sidelines, was openly downplaying, at least in public, any talk of having presidential ambitions in the future.\nHe broached the topic in an interview during the convention with the PBS NewsHour’s Jim Lehrer. “Certainly, it’s been put in deep cold storage,” McCain said of his desire to become president. “In 2004, I expect to be campaigning for the re-election of President George W. Bush. And by 2008, I think I might be ready to go down to the old soldiers’ home and await the cavalry charge there.”\nInstead, the Arizona senator, with his broader national profile, plunged back into his legislative work. Within two years, McCain clinched his signature legislative achievement: the bipartisan “McCain-Feingold” campaign finance law, which placed a new limit on individual and corporate donations to national political parties. Reformers applauded the law, saying that it would reduce the influence of special interests and give small donors more say. Critics argued the law would have the unintended consequence of empowering outside groups that do not have to disclose their campaign spending, and also give rise to a new era of secret, so-called “dark money” spending in politics.\nMcCain and Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., get a briefing from General David Petraeus during a visit to Baghdad in 2007. Photo taken April 1, 2007.

Nevertheless, the law was seen at the time as an important step forward, and remains the last major campaign finance measure to come out of Congress.\nMcCain also joined forces with some Democrats in efforts to overhaul the country’s immigration laws, and to preserve the Senate’s filibuster rules. At the same time, he clashed with the Bush administration on its push for tax cuts, and soured, over time, on its handling of the Iraq War. But even as the American death toll mounted and public opinion of the war eroded, McCain helped lead calls for a “surge” of U.S. troops into the country, and voiced support for then-Army Gen. David Petraeus’ plan to turn the tide there.\n“We who are willing to support this new strategy, and give General Petraeus the time and support he needs, have chosen a hard road,” McCain admitted during an April 2007 speech at the Virginia Military Institute. “But it is a right road. It is necessary and just,” he said, adding, “I would rather lose a campaign than a war.”\nThe speech, in many ways, was classic McCain. It embodied his sense of duty and belief in taking a principled stand, politics be damned. But his support for the troop surge aligned him more closely with Bush at a time when many Americans had grown weary of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. It would come back to haunt McCain when he ran for president again, this time against a young senator from Illinois.\nMcCain vs. Obama\nHis presidential ambitions having thawed from the “deep cold storage” he described after his first loss, McCain formally launched his second campaign for the White House in April 2007 in a speech in New Hampshire.\nThis second presidential bid seemed doomed early on. Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani and other Republicans soaked up attention and fundraising, and McCain was forced to shrink his campaign staff and rely on New Hampshire to save his campaign. It did. Republican primary voters there rewarded McCain again and vaulted him back into contention. The South Carolina primary, which derailed his 2000 bid, fell his way as well. He pressed ahead from there, through Florida, Super Tuesday, and eventually, to the 2008 Republican presidential nomination.\nThe revelry of the night he accepted the nomination gave way to a rocky fall campaign. McCain was pitted against the Democrats’ pick, Sen. Barack Obama, a freshman senator from Illinois who had become the first African-American presidential nominee from either of America’s two major parties. Obama drew large crowds to his events and his campaign set fundraising records.\nAt 47, Obama was also significantly younger than his 72-year-old opponent, and represented a new era of leaders who came of age after the Vietnam War and Watergate scandal — events that had shaped the perspective of politicians of McCain’s generation.\nMcCain and vice presidential nominee Gov. Sarah Palin wave to supporters at the 2008 Republican National Convention in St. Paul, Minnesota on September 4, 2008. Photo by REUTERS/Rick Wilking\nIn part to reduce the enthusiasm gap between the campaigns, McCain gambled by selecting a little-known politician, first-term Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, as his running mate. She helped the campaign draw energetic crowds, too, and the anti-establishment tone of her stump speeches lined up with parts of McCain’s message. But Palin quickly proved to be a major liability, famously displaying a weak grasp of foreign and domestic policy in a series of damaging interviews on national television. (In his recent memoir, McCain defended Palin’s performance that fall, but also said he wished he had gone with his gut instinct and chosen then-Sen. Joe Lieberman, a centrist Democrat from Connecticut, as his running mate.)\nMcCain’s selection of Palin, who had little exposure to national politics before joining the Republican ticket, undercut his main argument against electing Obama: that voters should not take a chance on a young and inexperienced politician. Nevertheless, McCain relied on that message in the presidential debates that fall, repeatedly asserting that Obama wasn’t experienced enough in politics and policy to protect the country from crises abroad and at home. Obama, meanwhile, made the argument that McCain’s politics and policies bore too much of a resemblance to those of the sitting Republican president.\n“I am not President Bush,” McCain told Obama during their third debate. “If you wanted to run against President Bush, you should have run four years ago.”\nThe defense didn’t work. In the end, the party led by McCain and Bush could not hold off what turned out to be a wave of support for the Democrats. McCain, whose campaign had also stumbled in responding to the start of the financial crisis, lost the popular vote by more than 9 million votes, and voters put Democrats in control of the White House and both houses of Congress for the first time since the early 1990s.\nMcCain and Barack Obama take part in the first U.S. presidential debate at the University of Mississippi in Oxford, Mississippi, on September 26, 2008. Photo by REUTERS/Jim Bourg/Pool\nMcCain did not wait long that night to concede. And when he did, he acknowledged the historical significance of Obama’s win, and urged the country to try and bridge its differences after a heated campaign.\n“Whatever our differences, we are fellow Americans,” McCain said in his concession speech. “And please believe me when I say no association has ever meant more to me than that.”\nThe final years\nMcCain remained a force in the Senate even as his career there stretched into fifth and sixth terms. He became a staunch critic of Obama’s foreign policy and eventually came to wield the gavel of the powerful Armed Services Committee.\nThere were also shifts in his politics, as McCain tried to balance his own bipartisan instincts with the demands of Arizona’s conservative base. On immigration, for instance, he was part of a 2013 bipartisan push to overhaul the country’s immigration laws, even after he took up a more conservative tone in a 2010 re-election ad, supporting efforts to “build a dang fence” along Arizona’s border with Mexico.\nBut his “maverick” tendencies persisted as well. He had already been diagnosed with brain cancer when he chastised the Trump administration last year, without referring to the Republican president by name, for letting “some half-baked, spurious nationalism” drive its foreign policy. And it was his dramatic “no” vote last year that sank a Republican proposal to repeal Obama’s health care law. McCain’s criticism of Trump and opposition to the health care repeal drew ire from some conservatives, who never forgave him for supporting the bipartisan immigration plan.\nMcCain attends the Senate Armed Services Committee hearing on worldwide threats in Washington, D.C. on March 23, 2017. Photo by Yuri Gripas/Reuters\nAt the time, the Republican-controlled Senate was struggling to clear any major legislation. McCain was frustrated, and he let it show, in what turned out to be one of his final floor speeches. “We’re getting nothing done, my friends! We’re getting nothing done,” he warned.\nFor most of his 15 minutes on the floor, McCain dwelt on the Senate’s dysfunction, and urged his colleagues to find a way to break it. But as stern as his warnings were, McCain struck a warm tone as well, using the occasion to reminisce on past successes: Those times he helped forge bipartisan solutions to national problems, he said, were the proudest moments of his career.\n“Make no mistake, my service here is the most important job I have had in my life,” he assured fellow senators. “It is an honor to serve the American people in your company.”\nAfter offering one last thanks to his Senate colleagues, he ended his speech, and yielded the floor.\nSupport Provided By:\nLearn more\nSupport PBS NewsHour:\nSubscribe to Here’s the Deal, our politics newsletter for analysis you won’t find anywhere else.\nThank you.

            "report_content": "The president has repeatedly disparaged the intelligence of service members, and asked that wounded veterans be kept out of military parades, multiple sources tell The Atlantic.\nWhen President Donald Trump canceled a visit to the Aisne-Marne American Cemetery near Paris in 2018, he blamed rain for the last-minute decision, saying that “the helicopter couldn’t fly” and that the Secret Service wouldn’t drive him there. Neither claim was true.\nTrump rejected the idea of the visit because he feared his hair would become disheveled in the rain, and because he did not believe it important to honor American war dead, according to four people with firsthand knowledge of the discussion that day. In a conversation with senior staff members on the morning of the scheduled visit, Trump said, “Why should I go to that cemetery? It’s filled with losers.” In a separate conversation on the same trip, Trump referred to the more than 1,800 marines who lost their lives at Belleau Wood as “suckers” for getting killed.\nFrom the April 2020 issue: The president is winning his war on American institutions\nBelleau Wood is a consequential battle in American history, and the ground on which it was fought is venerated by the Marine Corps. America and its allies stopped the German advance toward Paris there in the spring of 1918. But Trump, on that same trip, asked aides, “Who were the good guys in this war?” He also said that he didn’t understand why the United States would intervene on the side of the Allies.\nTrump’s understanding of concepts such as patriotism, service, and sacrifice has interested me since he expressed contempt for the war record of the late Senator John McCain, who spent more than five years as a prisoner of the North Vietnamese. “He’s not a war hero,” Trump said in 2015 while running for the Republican nomination for president. “I like people who weren’t captured.”\nRead: John McCain’s death brought out the worst in the Trump administration\nThere was no precedent in American politics for the expression of this sort of contempt, but the performatively patriotic Trump did no damage to his candidacy by attacking McCain in this manner. Nor did he set his campaign back by attacking the parents of Humayun Khan, an Army captain who was killed in Iraq in 2004.\nTrump remained fixated on McCain, one of the few prominent Republicans to continue criticizing him after he won the nomination. When McCain died, in August 2018, Trump told his senior staff, according to three sources with direct knowledge of this event, “We’re not going to support that loser’s funeral,” and he became furious, according to witnesses, when he saw flags lowered to half-staff. “What the fuck are we doing that for? Guy was a fucking loser,” the president told aides. Trump was not invited to McCain’s funeral. (These sources, and others quoted in this article, spoke on condition of anonymity. The White House did not return earlier calls for comment, but Alyssa Farah, a White House spokesperson, emailed me this statement shortly after this story was posted: “This report is false. President Trump holds the military in the highest regard. He’s demonstrated his commitment to them at every turn: delivering on his promise to give our troops a much needed pay raise, increasing military spending, signing critical veterans reforms, and supporting military spouses. This has no basis in fact.”)\nEliot A. Cohen: America’s generals must stand up to Trump\nTrump’s understanding of heroism has not evolved since he became president. According to sources with knowledge of the president’s views, he seems to genuinely not understand why Americans treat former prisoners of war with respect. Nor does he understand why pilots who are shot down in combat are honored by the military. On at least two occasions since becoming president, according to three sources with direct knowledge of his views, Trump referred to former President George H. W. Bush as a “loser” for being shot down by the Japanese as a Navy pilot in World War II. (Bush escaped capture, but eight other men shot down during the same mission were caught, tortured, and executed by Japanese soldiers.)\nWhen lashing out at critics, Trump often reaches for illogical and corrosive insults, and members of the Bush family have publicly opposed him. But his cynicism about service and heroism extends even to the World War I dead buried outside Paris—people who were killed more than a quarter century before he was born. Trump finds the notion of military service difficult to understand, and the idea of volunteering to serve especially incomprehensible. (The president did not serve in the military; he received a medical deferment from the draft during the Vietnam War because of the alleged presence of bone spurs in his feet. In the 1990s, Trump said his efforts to avoid contracting sexually transmitted diseases constituted his “personal Vietnam.”)\nAmy J. Rutenberg: What Trump’s draft deferments reveal\nOn Memorial Day 2017, Trump visited Arlington National Cemetery, a short drive from the White House. He was accompanied on this visit by John Kelly, who was then the secretary of homeland security, and who would, a short time later, be named the White House chief of staff. The two men were set to visit Section 60, the 14-acre area of the cemetery that is the burial ground for those killed in America’s most recent wars. Kelly’s son Robert is buried in Section 60. A first lieutenant in the Marine Corps, Robert Kelly was killed in 2010 in Afghanistan. He was 29. Trump was meant, on this visit, to join John Kelly in paying respects at his son’s grave, and to comfort the families of other fallen service members. But according to sources with knowledge of this visit, Trump, while standing by Robert Kelly’s grave, turned directly to his father and said, “I don’t get it. What was in it for them?” Kelly (who declined to comment for this story) initially believed, people close to him said, that Trump was making a ham-handed reference to the selflessness of America’s all-volunteer force. But later he came to realize that Trump simply does not understand non-transactional life choices.\n“He can’t fathom the idea of doing something for someone other than himself,” one of Kelly’s friends, a retired four-star general, told me. “He just thinks that anyone who does anything when there’s no direct personal gain to be had is a sucker. There’s no money in serving the nation.” Kelly’s friend went on to say, “Trump can’t imagine anyone else’s pain. That’s why he would say this to the father of a fallen marine on Memorial Day in the cemetery where he’s buried.”\nI’ve asked numerous general officers over the past year for their analysis of Trump’s seeming contempt for military service. They offer a number of explanations. Some of his cynicism is rooted in frustration, they say. Trump, unlike previous presidents, tends to believe that the military, like other departments of the federal government, is beholden only to him, and not the Constitution. Many senior officers have expressed worry about Trump’s understanding of the rules governing the use of the armed forces. This issue came to a head in early June, during demonstrations in Washington, D.C., in response to police killings of Black people. James Mattis, the retired Marine general and former secretary of defense, lambasted Trump at the time for ordering law-enforcement officers to forcibly clear protesters from Lafayette Square, and for using soldiers as props: “When I joined the military, some 50 years ago, I swore an oath to support and defend the Constitution,” Mattis wrote. “Never did I dream that troops taking that same oath would be ordered under any circumstance to violate the Constitutional rights of their fellow citizens—much less to provide a bizarre photo op for the elected commander-in-chief, with military leadership standing alongside.”\nRead: James Mattis denounces President Trump, describes him as a threat to the Constitution\nAnother explanation is more quotidian, and aligns with a broader understanding of Trump’s material-focused worldview. The president believes that nothing is worth doing without the promise of monetary payback, and that talented people who don’t pursue riches are “losers.” (According to eyewitnesses, after a White House briefing given by the then-chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Joe Dunford, Trump turned to aides and said, “That guy is smart. Why did he join the military?”)\nYet another, related, explanation concerns what appears to be Trump’s pathological fear of appearing to look like a “sucker” himself. His capacious definition of sucker includes those who lose their lives in service to their country, as well as those who are taken prisoner, or are wounded in battle. “He has a lot of fear,” one officer with firsthand knowledge of Trump’s views said. “He doesn’t see the heroism in fighting.” Several observers told me that Trump is deeply anxious about dying or being disfigured, and this worry manifests itself as disgust for those who have suffered. Trump recently claimed that he has received the bodies of slain service members “many, many” times, but in fact he has traveled to Dover Air Force Base, the transfer point for the remains of fallen service members, only four times since becoming president. In another incident, Trump falsely claimed that he had called “virtually all” of the families of service members who had died during his term, then began rush-shipping condolence letters when families said the president was not telling the truth.\nRead: Top military officers unload on Trump\nTrump has been, for the duration of his presidency, fixated on staging military parades, but only of a certain sort. In a 2018 White House planning meeting for such an event, Trump asked his staff not to include wounded veterans, on grounds that spectators would feel uncomfortable in the presence of amputees. “Nobody wants to see that,” he said.",

            "report_content": "An article in the Atlantic about President Donald Trump’s private remarks about service members and veterans took social media by storm the moment it was published on Sept. 3. Trump aggressively pushed back, rejecting the article’s conclusion that he had, on multiple occasions, disparaged those serving in the military, particularly service members who had been wounded or killed.\nOne of the claims in the article, which is based on anonymous sources, was about Trump’s private remarks about the late Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz. Trump and the 2008 Republican presidential nominee often tangled, including over McCain’s pivotal vote against a bill that would have overturned much of the Affordable Care Act.\nThe article by Atlantic editor Jeffrey Goldberg reads:\n\"Trump remained fixated on McCain, one of the few prominent Republicans to continue criticizing him after he won the nomination. When McCain died, in August 2018, Trump told his senior staff, according to three sources with direct knowledge of this event, ‘We’re not going to support that loser’s funeral,’ and he became furious, according to witnesses, when he saw flags lowered to half-staff. ‘What the f--- are we doing that for? Guy was a f---ing loser,’ the president told aides.\"\nAfter the article was published, Trump took to Twitter to reject its reporting, including what he said about McCain.\nMore:Trump campaigned in '16 on remaking Michigan manufacturing, Did he deliver?\nMore:Fact-checking Joe Biden’s comparison of violent crime and murders data\nOver three linked tweets, Trump wrote: \"I was never a big fan of John McCain, disagreed with him on many things including ridiculous endless wars and the lack of success he had in dealing with the VA and our great Vets, but the lowering of our Nations American Flags, and the first class funeral he was given by our Country, had to be approved by me, as President, & I did so without hesitation or complaint. Quite the contrary, I felt it was well deserved. I even sent Air Force One to bring his body, in casket, from Arizona to Washington. It was my honor to do so. Also, I never called John a loser and swear on whatever, or whoever, I was asked to swear on, that I never called our great fallen soldiers anything other than HEROES. This is more made up Fake News given by disgusting & jealous failures in a disgraceful attempt to influence the 2020 Election!\"\nHere, we’ll focus on Trump’s assertion that he \"never called (McCain) a loser.\"\nThe reality is that Trump did say that about McCain in a widely noted public event in 2015.\nThe event in question was a family leadership summit in Ames, Iowa, on July 18, 2015. Here’s the full video, with the remarks in question coming at about the 5:10 mark.\nAfter Trump recalled McCain saying something that Trump considered an insult to him and his supporters, \"I said, 'Somebody should run against McCain,' who has been, in my opinion, not so hot. And I supported him for president! I raised a million dollars for him. That's a lot of money! I supported him. He lost. He let us down. But he lost. So I never liked him much after that, because I don't like losers.\"\nAmid audience laughter, the moderator, Republican pollster Frank Luntz, then interjected, \"But he's a war hero!\"\nTrump responded, \"He’s not a war hero. He’s a war hero because he was captured. I like people that weren’t captured.\"\nLater that day, Trump retweeted, with seeming approval, a web post headlined \"Donald Trump: John McCain Is ‘A Loser,’\" that recapped his exchange at the summit.\nNeither the White House nor Trump’s campaign responded to an inquiry for this article.\nOur ruling: Trump tweeted, \"I never called John (McCain) a loser.\"\nThat’s false. He called McCain a loser at a televised event in 2015 and then, later that day, tweeted out a web post recapping the event.\nWe rate the statement Pants on Fire!",

            "report_content": "Advertisement\nSupported by\ntranscript\n“We’re getting nothing done, my friends. We’re getting nothing done.” It was a few days before the historic Obamacare repeal vote, and Republicans desperately needed John McCain. “It was a dramatic and consequential return for John McCain to the Senate floor.” “What a dramatic morning this is turning out to be, with John McCain making that surprise return to Washington.” “And McCain’s vote is going to give leadership a lot more breathing room.” But the maverick of the Senate had just been diagnosed with terminal brain cancer, and he was playing hard to get. “We’ve been spinning our wheels on too many important issues, because we keep trying to find a way to win without help from across the aisle.” But would he vote with his party, or would he defect? “I will not vote for this bill as it is today.” This was the kind of moment that John McCain lives for. He is going to be the deciding vote, and he’s got control of a major piece of legislation in his hand. “You heard John McCain. A really historic moment. Trying to set a new tone when it comes to fixing our health care system.” When you go against the grain in Washington, you get a lot of attention. “Shutting down the government injured the people of my state. Why? Why would we want to do that?” John McCain had a big ego, and he liked the attention. But also, I do think that the maverick aspect to McCain was real. He saw a lot of the things that went on in Washington as semi-idiotic, or corrupt. “I think the Congress of the United States — both Republicans and Democrats — should be ashamed of themselves. These may be worthy projects. They may be. Generally they aren’t. How many more lawmakers, staffers, government officials, and contractors have to go to jail before we actually fix this process?” He liked challenging authority. It may be part of that is just growing up in a military family and having all that military experience, where you’re subject to so much authority. “I have trouble with this. More than two-syllable words —” In the political phase of his life, he was willing to step up, take a chance, and shake up the system. “Eleven million people live in the shadows, and they live here in de facto amnesty, and, by God, they are being exploited every single day.” Of course, he switched back and forth when it suited his politics. “We will secure the borders first when I am president of the United States. I am proud that Republicans are the party of lower taxes. I cannot in good conscience vote in favor of tax cuts.” There have been so many John McCains over the years. He came to Congress as this exalted war hero who’d already had a national reputation because of his time as a P.O.W. in Vietnam. McCain was shot down, held for years in terrible conditions in the Hanoi Hilton. He had a high profile because of his father. “The commander in chief of our Pacific forces, Admiral John S. McCain Jr.” “As you know, we are living in a troubled world —” They knew that they had something of a celebrity prisoner there. He was tortured, subjected to really unthinkable experiences. He resisted and resisted, but ultimately did make a confession. That really haunted him through the rest of his life. He felt that he had caved and betrayed his country. When he returned from Vietnam, to much acclaim, he was an ambitious guy, and he quickly turned to politics. “John McCain, a name Arizonans are talking about.” He ran for the House. Came in as a pretty conventional conservative — somebody who wanted to get on board the Reagan Revolution. “Speaker, like a poor fellow who brought his horse to water but could not make it drink, Walter Mondale proposes to throw more tax money at the deficit with little chance of making it shrink.” But there was a watershed moment coming for John McCain — “— a major congressional scandal —” The Keating Five Scandal. “Charles Keating, a millionaire banker who has come to embody the savings and loan scandal —” A group of senators — a bipartisan group — had interceded on behalf of a big businessman, and they tried to help him out of a regulatory problem. It was a big scandal at the moment, because the S&amp;L crisis was huge back then. “Do you swear under oath to this committee you were unaware of that at the time?” McCain was ultimately cleared of any wrongdoing. “But I understand why the committee made the arrangements they did.” He thought it be besmirched his honor, which is probably the most important thing to John McCain besides his family, is his honor. This was a searing experience for McCain, and it really helped shape his later image as a maverick, because he immediately became someone, I think, who wanted to shake up the system and rein in the influence of money and politics. “There’s too much money washing around, and this money makes good people do bad things, and bad people do worse things.” John McCain was ready to do that. His party really wasn’t. They liked the campaign system the way it was, particularly Mitch McConnell. “To effectively discuss issues in this country, one must have access to money.” He was the leading foe of John McCain. “Who do you want to be the next president of these United States? McCain! That’s right.” So McCain had presidential ambitions. 2000 seemed like a good opportunity for him. This was the year of the famous Straight Talk Express. He was really letting it hang out in a lot of ways. “If I were a tree, I would be a —” “If I were a tree, I would be a root. What does that mean? I’d be glad to tell you —” But he ran into a real buzzsaw with the Bush family and Karl Rove. “Let me finish. Let me finish.” “All right, then.” The Bush campaign did some really tough negative advertising. “McCain’s campaign is crawling with lobbyists.” “His conservative hometown paper warns — It’s time the rest of the nation learns about the McCain we know.” McCain was stung when he came back to the Senate, you could tell. “Gentlemen —” “Senator John McCain, the Republican, and Senator Barack Obama, the —” In 2008, this was really John McCain’s last opportunity. He took the nomination, but he was really in trouble from the start. Obama, the celebrity candidate, the economic collapse — “The fundamentals of our economy are strong —” — picking Sarah Palin as his running mate. “This is absolutely overwhelming.” People really questioned John McCain’s judgment on that. Even at the end, McCain was still fighting the leaders of his party. “Yesterday, I received a call from President Putin of Russia —” Being cozy with the Russians, pulling back in Asia. To John McCain, this was anathema. He wouldn’t mention Trump by name, but he would talk about failures of American foreign policy and the conduct. “— refuse the obligations of international leadership for the sake of some half-baked, spurious nationalism cooked up by people who would rather find scapegoats than solve problems.” This was amped up more after the diagnosis of brain cancer. I think that was also part of his vote on the health care repeal. At the climactic moment, he walked out onto the floor, turned thumbs down, and killed the repeal effort. It was one of his last big acts as a U.S. senator. “Making news in the 11th hour —” “The resistance to President Trump had its biggest victory yet.” “This is a major defeat.” “You could look at this one moment like a Renaissance painting.” “It was unbelievable.” McCain wasn’t going to go quietly.\nBy Robert D. McFadden\nJohn S. McCain, the proud naval aviator who climbed from depths of despair as a prisoner of war in Vietnam to pinnacles of power as a Republican congressman and senator from Arizona and a two-time contender for the presidency, died on Saturday at his home in Arizona. He was 81.\nAccording to a statement from his office, Mr. McCain died at 4:28 p.m. local time. He had suffered from a malignant brain tumor, called a glioblastoma, for which he had been treated periodically with radiation and chemotherapy since its discovery in 2017.\nDespite his grave condition, he soon made a dramatic appearance in the Senate to cast a thumbs-down vote against his party’s drive to repeal the Affordable Care Act. But while he was unable to be in the Senate for a vote on the Republican tax bill in December, his endorsement was crucial, though not decisive, in the Trump administration’s lone legislative triumph of the year.\nA son and grandson of four-star admirals who were his larger-than-life heroes, Mr. McCain carried his renowned name into battle and into political fights for more than a half-century. It was an odyssey driven by raw ambition, the conservative instincts of a shrewd military man, a rebelliousness evident since childhood and a temper that sometimes bordered on explosiveness.\nNowhere were those traits more manifest than in Vietnam, where he was stripped of all but his character. He boiled over in foul curses at his captors. Because his father was the commander of all American forces in the Pacific during most of his five and a half years of captivity, Mr. McCain, a Navy lieutenant commander, became the most famous prisoner of the war, a victim of horrendous torture and a tool of enemy propagandists.\nShot down over Hanoi, suffering broken arms and a shattered leg, he was subjected to solitary confinement for two years and beaten frequently. Often he was suspended by ropes lashing his arms behind him. He attempted suicide twice. His weight fell to 105 pounds. He rejected early release to keep his honor and to avoid an enemy propaganda coup or risk demoralizing his fellow prisoners.\nHe finally cracked under torture and signed a “confession.” No one believed it, although he felt the burden of betraying his country. To millions of Americans, Mr. McCain was the embodiment of courage: a war hero who came home on crutches, psychologically scarred and broken in body, but not in spirit. He underwent long medical treatments and rehabilitation, but was left permanently disabled, unable to raise his arms over his head. Someone had to comb his hair.\nA memorial to those who lost their lives in 2018\nHis mother, Roberta McCain, Navy all the way, inspired his political career. After retiring from the Navy and settling in Arizona, he won two terms in the House of Representatives, from 1983 to 1987, and six in the Senate. He was a Reagan Republican to start with, but later moved right or left, a maverick who defied his party’s leaders and compromised with Democrats.\nHe lost the 2000 Republican presidential nomination to George W. Bush, who won the White House.\nIn 2008, against the backdrop of a growing financial crisis, Mr. McCain made the most daring move of his political career, seeking the presidency against the first major-party African-American nominee, Barack Obama. With national name recognition, a record for campaign finance reform and a reputation for candor — his campaign bus was called the Straight Talk Express — Mr. McCain won a series of primary elections and captured the Republican nomination.\n12 Photos\nView Slide Show ›\nBut his selection of Gov. Sarah Palin of Alaska as his running mate, although meant to be seen as a bold, unconventional move in keeping with his maverick’s reputation, proved a severe handicap. She was the second female major-party nominee for vice president (and the first Republican), but voters worried about her qualifications to serve as president, and about Mr. McCain’s age — he would be 72, the oldest person ever to take the White House. In a 2018 memoir, “The Restless Wave: Good Times, Just Causes, Great Fights and Other Appreciations,” he defended Ms. Palin’s campaign performance, but expressed regret that he had not instead chosen Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, a Democrat-turned-independent.\nAt some McCain rallies, vitriolic crowds disparaged black people and Muslims, and when a woman said she did not trust Mr. Obama because “he’s an Arab,” Mr. McCain, in one of the most lauded moments of his campaign, replied: “No, ma’am. He’s a decent family man, a citizen that I just happen to have disagreements with on fundamental issues.”\nAnalysts later said that Mr. Obama had engineered a nearly perfect campaign. And Mr. McCain confronted a hostile political environment for Republicans, who were dragged down by President George W. Bush’s dismal approval ratings amid the economic crisis and an unpopular war in Iraq.\nOn Election Day, Mr. McCain lost most of the battleground states and some that were traditionally Republican. Mr. Obama won  with 53 percent of the popular vote to Mr. McCain’s 46 percent, and 365 Electoral College votes to Mr. McCain’s 173.\n“Few of us have been tested the way John once was, or required to show the kind of courage that he did,” Mr. Obama said Saturday. “But all of us can aspire to the courage to put the greater good above our own. At John’s best, he showed us what that means.”\nReturning to his Senate duties, the resilient Mr. McCain moved to the right politically to fend off a Tea Party challenge to his 2010 re-election. He voted against the Affordable Care Act, Mr. Obama’s signature health care plan, which became law in 2010. He endorsed Mitt Romney’s losing Republican bid for the presidency in 2012.\nBut while he was a persistent and outspoken critic of the Obama administration, Mr. McCain had by 2013 become a pivotal figure in the Senate, meeting with Mr. Obama and occasionally fashioning deals with him. He joined a bipartisan group of senators, known as the Gang of Eight, that sought compromises on comprehensive immigration reform.\n“When Mr. McCain is with the president — on immigration and in brokering the recent deal to secure Senate approval of stalled Obama nominees — they can usually trump the political right,” The New York Times said in a 2013 news analysis. “When he is against him — sabotaging Mr. Obama’s plan last year to nominate Susan E. Rice as secretary of state — the White House rarely prevails.”\nAs Congress reconvened in January 2015 with Republicans in control of the Senate, Mr. McCain achieved his longtime goal to become chairman of the Armed Services Committee, with the power to advance his national security and fiscal objectives under a $600 billion military policy bill. He considered the post second only to occupying the White House as commander in chief.\nWith the rise of Donald J. Trump, the Republican flame thrower who steered American politics sharply to the right after his election in 2016 as the nation’s 45th president, Mr. McCain was one of the few powerful Republican voices in Congress to push back against Mr. Trump’s often harsh, provocative statements and Twitter posts and his tide of changes.\nIn his end-of-life memoir, Mr. McCain scorned Mr. Trump’s seeming admiration for autocrats and disdain for refugees. “He seems uninterested in the moral character of world leaders and their regimes,” he wrote of the president. “The appearance of toughness or a reality show facsimile of toughness seems to matter more than any of our values. Flattery secures his friendship, criticism his enmity.”\nLong before Mr. Trump was criticized as setting new lows for public discourse, Mr. McCain himself had used coarse language and blunt insults, although they were far less assertive, and he often used them in jest. He called Secretary of State John Kerry, a Democrat, “a human wrecking ball,” and the right-wing Republican Senators Ted Cruz of Texas and Rand Paul of Kentucky “wacko birds.”\nPersonal animus between Mr. McCain and Mr. Trump arose in the Republican presidential primaries in 2016. After months of boasts by Trump about his wealth, celebrity and deal-making as qualifications for the White House, and his dismissive capsule characterizations of climate change as “a hoax” and the Iraq war as “a mistake,” Mr. McCain and Mr. Romney, with standing as the previous two Republican presidential nominees, denounced Mr. Trump as unfit for the presidency.\nSaying Mr. Trump had neither the temperament nor the judgment for the White House, Mr. McCain and Mr. Romney called him ignorant on foreign policy and said he had made “dangerous” statements on national security. They warned that his election might imperil the United States and its democratic systems.\nIn a venomous response, Mr. Trump denigrated Mr. Romney as a “failed candidate” and “a loser” beaten by Mr. Obama. He had little to say about Mr. McCain. But months earlier, Mr. Trump, who had never served in the military (or held public office) had derided Mr. McCain as a bogus war hero and made light of his years of captivity and torture.\n“He’s a war hero because he was captured,” Mr. Trump said. “I like people who weren’t captured.”\nMr. McCain held his fire. But the nation was shocked. An avalanche of denunciations tumbled from editorial boards and political leaders, but the outrage faded into the tapestry of Mr. Trump’s provocations against Mexicans, Muslims, women and black and Hispanic people. Trump supporters, who were mostly white, said his biases showed a refreshing willingness to disregard political correctness.\nOn Saturday night, Mr. Trump expressed his sympathies and respect for Mr. McCain’s family, but refrained from commenting on the senator himself.\nAs the Trump juggernaut rolled on, Mr. McCain, campaigning for re-election to his sixth six-year term, did not attend the Republican National Convention in Cleveland, but said he would support his party’s nominee. (Mr. McCain withdrew that support months later after a recording surfaced exposing lewd comments about women by Mr. Trump, who bragged that his celebrity allowed him to grope them.)\nDays after the Democrats nominated Hillary Clinton as the first major-party female candidate for the presidency, Mr. McCain rebuked Mr. Trump for his comments about the family of a Muslim Army captain killed by a suicide bomber as he tried to save fellow American troops in Iraq in 2004. Given the podium at the Democratic convention, Khizr Khan, the father of the captain, Humayun Khan, had denounced Mr. Trump for suggesting that Muslims harbored terrorist sympathies.\nWith his wife, Ghazala, at his side, the father held up a pocket-size copy of the Constitution and asked if Mr. Trump had read it.\nIn response, Mr. Trump belittled the parents, saying the soldier’s father had delivered the speech because his wife had not been “allowed” to speak. His implication, that Mrs. Khan had not spoken because of female subservience in some strains of Islam, drew widespread condemnation, led on Capitol Hill by Senator McCain.\n“While our party has bestowed upon him the nomination, it is not accompanied by unfettered license to defame those who are the best among us,” Mr. McCain said. “I challenge the nominee to set the example for what our country can and should represent.”\nSoon after Mr. McCain’s statement, other Republican senators offered their own condemnations. In ensuing days, as outrage over the Trump remarks spread, Mr. Trump told his Twitter followers that Mr. Khan had “no right” to “viciously” attack him.\nSeemingly impervious to criticism of any kind, Mr. Trump, who had easily won nomination, turned his guns on Mrs. Clinton. After a bruising campaign laden with Trump falsehoods and scurrilous innuendo, he defeated her in the general election, losing the popular vote by nearly three million but winning in the Electoral College.\nAfter the election, Mr. McCain, determined to let the new administration take shape, said he would temporarily not discuss Mr. Trump publicly.\nBut weeks after President Trump moved into the White House and began blindsiding the public and sometimes the government with executive orders and mixed messages on immigration, foreign policy and other issues, Mr. McCain, himself newly re-elected, let loose.\nAt a security conference in Munich, he delivered a forceful critique of Mr. Trump’s “America First” program before a receptive audience of allied officials and foreign policy experts dismayed at the administration’s drift from seven decades of Western alliances.\n“Make no mistake, my friends, these are dangerous times,” Mr. McCain said. “But you should not count America out, and we should not count each other out.”\nAs for Mr. Trump’s claim that his White House was operating like a “fine-tuned machine,” Mr. McCain said, “In many respects, this administration is in disarray.”\nAppearing on the NBC News program “Meet the Press” a day later, Mr. McCain punctured Mr. Trump’s contention that the news media was “the enemy of the American people.”\n“The first thing that dictators do is shut down the press,” Mr. McCain, a strong defender of the First Amendment, told his national television audience. While not expressly calling the president a dictator, he said, “We need to learn the lessons of history.”\n[John McCain to lie in state at capitols in Washington and Arizona. Here’s what that means.]\nFor a senator who had long backed free trade, NATO and assertive foreign policies, and who had harbored suspicions about Russian intentions, Mr. McCain’s differences with Mr. Trump ran deep. He denounced Russia for “interfering” in the presidential election and called for a select Senate committee to investigate the Kremlin’s cyberactivities.\nHis disapproval of Mr. Trump perhaps peaked in July, after the president and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia met privately in Helsinki, Finland, and then participated in an extraordinary joint news conference there. Responding to Mr. Trump’s performance, in which the president spoke favorably of his Russian counterpart and questioned American intelligence findings that the Russians had interfered in the 2016 presidential election, Mr. McCain declared, “No prior president has ever abased himself more abjectly before a tyrant.”\nWeeks later, in signing a $716 billion military spending bill named in Mr. McCain’s honor, Mr. Trump did not mention the senator by name in what was widely interpreted as a deliberate snub.\nAlthough Mr. McCain was sharply critical of Mr. Trump, especially when he thought the new president had threatened to overstep domestic or national interests, he remained broadly supportive of the administration’s agenda.\nAfter an acrimonious yearlong fight over replacing the late Justice Antonin Scalia on the Supreme Court, Mr. McCain joined the Senate’s 54-to-45 majority to confirm Mr. Trump’s selection of Neil Gorsuch as an associate justice. Justice Gorsuch’s installation tipped the court’s balance in favor of a conservative majority that seemed destined to last for years.\nMr. McCain voted for all but two of Mr. Trump’s 15 cabinet selections and eight other administration posts requiring Senate confirmation. But he also chastised Mr. Trump for comments equating Russian and American interests. “That moral equivalency is a contradiction of everything the United States has ever stood for in the 20th and 21st centuries,” he said.\nDuring a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing taking testimony from James B. Comey, the former F.B.I. director who was fired by Mr. Trump, Mr. McCain posed confusing questions, seeming to conflate the 2016 investigation of Mrs. Clinton’s use of a private email server as secretary of state with the 2017 investigation of Russian interference in the American election. He later issued a clarification.\n“What I was trying to get at was whether Mr. Comey believes that any of his interactions with the president rise to the level of obstruction of justice,” he said. “In the case of Secretary Clinton’s emails, Mr. Comey was willing to step beyond his role as an investigator and state his belief about what ‘no reasonable prosecutor’ would conclude about the evidence. I wanted Mr. Comey to apply the same approach to the key question surrounding his interactions with President Trump — whether or not the president’s conduct constitutes obstruction of justice.”\nSince he had opposed the Affordable Care Act, Mr. Obama’s signature health care law, Mr. McCain became a critical vote on the Republican bill to repeal and replace it. Written in secret, the Republicans’ bill was opposed by health care and patient advocacy groups. Mr. McCain, fearing his constituents might be harmed, was noncommittal. After struggling to write a passable bill and with no votes to spare, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, put off a showdown when Mr. McCain was sidelined by surgery for a cranial blood clot over his left eye in July.\nSenator McCain’s office disclosed that, behind the clot, his doctors had found a glioblastoma, an aggressive and malignant brain tumor. Medical experts said that such cancers may be treated with radiation and chemotherapy but almost always grow back, and that the median length of survival with a glioblastoma is about 16 months.\nDays after surgery for the brain cancer, Mr. McCain returned to the Senate and provided a crucial vote for the Republicans to open debate on their efforts to repeal the health law. But when a last-ditch repeal vote was taken later, Mr. McCain made a stirring televised reappearance in the well of the Senate and shocked his colleagues and the nation by turning his thumb down, casting the decisive vote against it.\nThe seven-year Republican drive to derail the Affordable Care Act had collapsed. Some pundits called the McCain vote cold revenge for Mr. Trump’s mockery of his ordeal as a prisoner of war. But the senator told colleagues that he felt compelled only to “do the right thing.” And in a later statement, he gave a fuller explanation.\n[Read John McCain: The last lion in the Senate.]\n“The vote last night presents the Senate with an opportunity to start fresh,” he said. “I encourage my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to trust each other, stop the political gamesmanship and put the health care needs of the American people first. We can do this.”\nIn December, Mr. McCain had been expected to be a pivotal vote in the Republican drive to rewrite the nation’s tax code and cut taxes for individuals and businesses by adding up to $1.5 trillion to the federal deficit. Critics of the measure had identified him as a potential holdout against his party’s legislation. Days before the vote, however, Mr. McCain returned home to Arizona for medical treatment, and he did not cast a ballot in the Senate proceedings. But he endorsed the bill, and his support was important, though not decisive, in the Senate’s 51-48 adoption of the tax package.\nJohn Sidney McCain III was born on Aug. 29, 1936, at the Coco Solo Naval Air Station in the Panama Canal Zone, one of many posts where his father, John Sidney McCain Jr., served in a long, distinguished Navy career. He was the middle sibling of three children. His mother, born Roberta Wright, was a California oil heiress. His parents eloped to Tijuana, Mexico, to marry in 1933.\nWith his older sister, Jean Alexandra (who was known as Sandy), and brother, Joseph Pinckney McCain II, John grew up with frequent moves, an often-absent father, a rock-solid mother and family lore that traced ancestral lineages to combatants in every American war and to Scottish clans. There were also highly dubious family claims of having descended from Robert the Bruce, the 14th-century king of the Scots.\nThe patriarch of the 20th-century military family was John’s grandfather, Adm. John Sidney McCain Sr. A pioneer of aircraft carriers, he led many naval and air operations in the Western Pacific in World War II, covering Gen. Douglas MacArthur’s invasion of the Philippines and inflicting heavy losses on the enemy in the war’s final stages. He was in the front row of officers aboard the battleship Missouri in Tokyo Bay when the Japanese signed the documents of surrender in 1945.\nJohn’s father was a decorated submarine commander in World War II. In Washington, the elder Mr. McCain was influential in political affairs as the postwar Navy’s chief information officer and liaison with Congress. Senators, representatives and military brass were often guests at his home. Raised to full admiral, he was the commander of American naval forces in Europe and, from 1968 to 1972, of all American forces in the Pacific, including those in the Vietnam War theater.\n(Two Navy destroyers were named McCain, for the senator’s father and grandfather, the first father-and-son full admirals in American naval history.)\nWhipsawed by family relocations, young John attended some 20 schools before finally settling into Episcopal High School, an all-white, all-boys boarding school in Alexandria, Va., in the fall of 1951 for his last three years of secondary education. The school, with an all-male faculty and enrollments drawn mostly from upper-crust families of the Old South, required jackets and ties for classes.\nBut the scion of one of the Navy’s most illustrious families was defiant and unruly. He mocked the dress code by wearing dirty bluejeans. His shoes were held together with tape, and his coat looked like a reject from the Salvation Army. He was cocky and combative, easily provoked and ready to fight anyone. Classmates called him McNasty. Most gave him a wide berth.\n“He cultivated the image,” Robert Timberg wrote in a biography, “John McCain: An American Odyssey” (1995). “The Episcopal yearbook pictures him in a trench coat, collar up, cigarette dangling Bogey-style from his lips. That pose, if hardly the impression Episcopal sought to project, at least had a fashionable world-weary style to it.”\nJohn and a few friends often sneaked off campus at night to patronize bars and burlesque houses in Washington. He joined the wrestling team — a 127-pound dynamo, he once pinned an opponent in 37 seconds, a school record — and the junior varsity football team, as a linebacker and offensive guard. His grades were abysmal, except in literature and history, his favorite subjects. He graduated in 1954.\nThat summer, he followed his father and grandfather into the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis, Md. He resisted the discipline. His grades were poor. He stood up to upperclassmen, broke rules and piled up demerits, though never enough to warrant expulsion. But he became a ferocious boxer, a magnet for attractive young women and one of the most popular midshipmen in his class.\nMr. McCain possessed the rugged independence of a natural leader. It came out at parties and in carousing with friends. Caught by the Shore Patrol at an off-limits bar, he led a carload of drinking buddies in a daring escape. “Being on liberty with John McCain was like being in a train wreck,” one recalled. In 1958, he graduated 894th in his class, fifth from the bottom.\nAccepted for flight training, the newly commissioned Ensign McCain learned to fly attack jets at the Naval Air Station in Pensacola, Fla. He also had flings with a succession of young women, from schoolteachers to strippers, and once with a tobacco heiress, “often returning to base just in time to change clothes and drag himself out to the flight line,” Mr. Timberg said.\nHe liked flying, but his performance was subpar, sometimes careless or even reckless. In the 1960s he crashed in Corpus Christi Bay in Texas and Tidewater, Va., but escaped with minor injuries — and his flying skills improved over time. Early assignments were aboard aircraft carriers: the Intrepid in the Caribbean during the 1962 Cuban missile crisis, and the Enterprise in the Mediterranean.\nIn 1965, Mr. McCain married Carol Shepp, a model. He adopted her two children, Douglas and Andrew, and they had a daughter, Sidney. After a long separation, the couple were divorced in 1980. He then married Cindy Lou Hensley, a Phoenix teacher whose father owned a beer distributorship. They had two sons, John IV and James, and a daughter, Meghan, and adopted a girl, Bridget, from a Bangladeshi orphanage.\nSenator McCain’s survivors include his wife; his mother, who is 106; his brother; his sister, Sandy McCain Morgan; his seven children; and five grandchildren.\nPromoted to lieutenant commander in early 1967, Mr. McCain requested combat duty and was assigned to the carrier Forrestal, operating in the Gulf of Tonkin. Its A-4E Skyhawk warplanes were bombing North Vietnam in the campaign known as Operation Rolling Thunder. He flew five missions.\nThen, on July 29, 1967, he had just strapped himself into his cockpit on a deck crowded with planes when a missile fired accidentally from another jet struck his 200-gallon exterior fuel tank, and it exploded in flames. He scrambled out, crawled onto the plane’s nose, dived onto a deck seething with burning fuel and rolled away until he cleared the flames.\nAs he stood up, other aircraft and bomb loads exploded on deck. He was hit in the legs and chest by burning shrapnel. At one point, the Forrestal skipper considered abandoning ship. When the fire was finally brought under control, 134 men had been killed.\nDespite his misgivings, Mr. McCain volunteered for more missions and was transferred to the carrier Oriskany. On Oct. 26 he took off on his 23rd mission of the war, part of a 20-plane attack on a heavily defended power plant in central Hanoi. Moments after releasing his bombs on target, as he pulled out of his dive, a Soviet-made surface-to-air missile sheared off his right wing.\nHe ejected as the plane plunged, but hit something as he exited. Both arms were broken and his right knee was shattered. He fell into a lake and, with 50 pounds of gear, sank 15 feet to the bottom, then pulled the inflating pins of his Mae West life jacket with his teeth and rose to the surface, gasping for air. Swimmers dragged him ashore, where he was set upon by a mob.\nMr. McCain was stripped to his skivvies, kicked and spat upon, then bayoneted in the left ankle and groin. A North Vietnamese soldier struck him with his rifle butt, breaking a shoulder. A woman tried to give him a cup of tea as a photographer snapped pictures. Carried to a truck, Mr. McCain was driven to Hoa Lo, the prison compound its American inmates had labeled the Hanoi Hilton.\nThere he was denied medical care. His knee swelled to the size and color of a football. He lapsed in and out of consciousness for days. When he awoke in a cell infested with roaches and rats, he was interrogated and beaten. The beatings continued for days. He gave his name, rank and serial number and defied his tormentors with curses.\nAfter two weeks, a doctor, without anesthesia, tried to set his right arm, broken in three places, but gave up in frustration and encased it in a plaster cast. He was moved to another site and tended by two American prisoners of war, who brought him back from near death.\nCommander McCain’s prisoner-of-war status was widely reported around the world. Only after his captors learned that his father was an admiral was he given a modicum of medical treatment. Other prisoners said he spoke, incongruously, of someday being president of the United States.\nOnce he was visited by a group of North Vietnamese dignitaries. A prisoner, Jack Van Loan, said Mr. McCain shrieked at them. “Here’s a guy that’s all crippled up, all busted up, and he doesn’t know if he’s going to live to the next day, and he literally blew them out of there with a verbal assault,” Mr. Van Loan told Mr. Timberg. “You can’t imagine the example John set for the rest of the camp by doing that.”\nIn March 1968, Mr. McCain was put in solitary confinement, fed only watery pumpkin soup and scraps of bread. It lasted two years. When Admiral McCain became the Pacific Theater commander in July, his son was offered early repatriation repeatedly. Commander McCain refused, following a military code that prisoners were to be released in the order taken. He was beaten frequently and tortured with ropes.\nYears after his confession to “war crimes” and “air piracy,” Mr. McCain wrote: “I had learned what we all learned over there: that every man has his breaking point. I had reached mine.”\nHis ordeal finally ended on March 14, 1973, two months after the Paris Peace Accords had ended American involvement in the war. The place he had lived longest in his nomadic life was Hanoi. At 36, his hair had gone white. He went home a celebrity, cheered in parades, showered with medals, embraced by President Richard M. Nixon and Gov. Ronald Reagan of California.\nFor a Navy man who had always tried to live up to his father’s accomplishments, the Silver and Bronze Stars, the Distinguished Flying Cross and other decorations he received were not enough. But a psychiatrist’s report seemed to capture his happiest moment. “Felt fulfillment,” it said, “when his dad was introduced at a dinner as ‘Commander McCain’s father.’ ”\nAfter months of rehabilitation and recovery, he returned to duty and became the Navy’s Senate liaison, as his father had once been. But he knew that his Navy future would be limited by his physical disabilities, and that he would never be an admiral like his forebears. With his mother’s encouragement, he was already thinking about a political career when he retired as a captain in 1981.\nSetting his sights on a congressional seat, he settled in Phoenix and became a public relations executive for his father-in-law’s beer distributorship. He developed contacts in the news media and business community, and got to know real estate developers and bankers like Charles Keating Jr.\nWhen Representative John Rhodes of Arizona retired after 30 years in Congress in 1982, Mr. McCain, in a campaign partly financed by his wife, easily won the seat in a Republican district. He embraced President Reagan’s agenda of tax and budget cuts and a strong national defense, but voted to override Mr. Reagan’s veto of sanctions against South Africa for its racist policies. He was re-elected in 1984.\nAfter Senator Barry M. Goldwater decided not to seek re-election as Arizona’s conservative stalwart in 1986, Mr. McCain crushed Richard Kimball, a former Democratic state legislator, for the seat. He won appointments to the Armed Services Committee, the Commerce Committee and the Indian Affairs Committee, and soon gained national attention.\nA longtime gambler with ties to the gaming industry, Mr. McCain helped write the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act in 1988, codifying regulations for Native American gambling enterprises. He backed legislation, sponsored by Senators Phil Gramm of Texas and Warren B. Rudman of New Hampshire, for automatic spending cuts in deficit budgets. He was shortlisted as a vice-presidential running mate by the 1988 Republican nominee, George Bush, who won the White House (with Senator Dan Quayle on the ticket).\nBut Mr. McCain’s rising political career was almost upended by scandal. He was one of five senators who took favors from Charles Keating to intercede with federal regulators on behalf of the Lincoln Savings and Loan Association, which collapsed with catastrophic losses. The scandal cost the government and investors billions, and Mr. Keating went to prison for fraud; the so-called Keating Five, cleared of wrongdoing by Senate investigators, were only rebuked for ethical lapses.\nIn the years that followed, Mr. McCain reinvented himself as a scourge of special interests, crusading for stricter ethics and campaign finance rules, a man of honor chastened by a brush with shame.\nThe Persian Gulf War in 1991 also helped restore Mr. McCain’s tarnished image. As a television commentator, he showcased his military savvy and impressed Americans as an authoritative voice on foreign policy. While Mr. Bush lost the White House to Bill Clinton in 1992, Mr. McCain easily won re-election.\nAfter years of voting along party lines, Mr. McCain, in the 1990s, emphasized his independence. With the presidency in his distant sights, he challenged Republican leaders and Democrats and was harder to peg politically. He became a self-appointed Republican spokesman on national security — challenging the Clinton administration’s intervention in Somalia, counseling against deploying American troops to the Balkans and sounding an early warning on North Korea’s nuclear ambitions.\nMr. McCain was a member of the Select Committee on P.O.W./M.I.A. Affairs, which found “no compelling evidence” that Americans were still alive in captivity in Southeast Asia. (Senator John Kerry, a Democrat and fellow Vietnam War veteran, was the chairman.) Veterans groups and families of long-missing troops rejected the report. He also pressed for full diplomatic relations with Vietnam, which were achieved in 1995.\nIn the 1996 election, Mr. McCain appeared to be a favorite for the Republican vice-presidential slot, but former Senator Bob Dole, the Republican presidential nominee, chose Jack Kemp, the former congressman and football star. They would lose to Mr. Clinton and Al Gore.\nMr. McCain won re-election to a third term by a landslide in 1998, and a year later he published a memoir, “Faith of My Fathers,” which became a best seller in time for the 2000 election campaign and was later made into a television movie, starring Shawn Hatosy as Mr. McCain.\nSeeking the 2000 Republican presidential nomination, Mr. McCain pledged “a fight to take our government back from the power brokers and special interests.” Gov. George W. Bush of Texas was favored, but Mr. McCain won the New Hampshire primary, 49 to 30 percent. South Carolina’s primary then loomed as crucial.\nIt was one of the era’s dirtiest campaigns. Anonymous smears falsely claimed that Mr. McCain had fathered a black child out of wedlock, that his wife was a drug addict and that he was a homosexual, a traitor and mentally unstable. McCain ads portrayed Mr. Bush as a liar and called his religious supporters, the Rev. Jerry Falwell and the televangelist Pat Robertson, “agents of intolerance.”\nMr. McCain later said he regretted calling a Confederate flag on the State Capitol in Columbia a “symbol of heritage.” Civil rights groups had denounced it as a symbol of slavery and oppression of African-Americans. “I feared that if I answered honestly, I could not win the South Carolina primary,” Mr. McCain admitted.\nMr. Bush won the primary and the nomination, and narrowly defeated the Democrat, Vice President Gore, in the general election.\n[Reflections of John McCain’s decades in public life by reporters and editors at The Times.]\nAlways wary of an adventurousness that might blind Mr. McCain to potential embarrassments, his advisers grew anxious during the 2000 campaign when a lobbyist, Vicki Iseman, began turning up with him at fund-raisers and at his office. It came to nothing. But a long report in The Times in 2008 said that aides, fearing a romantic involvement, had cautioned Mr. McCain and warned Ms. Iseman off.\nThe article raised a flap of angry denials, and Ms. Iseman sued the newspaper for libel. The Times did not retract its article but published a note to readers saying it had not intended to suggest a romantic affair, and the suit was dropped.\nAfter the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, Mr. McCain supported the Bush administration’s war on terrorism; its invasion of Afghanistan to suppress a fanatic Taliban regime and hunt for Osama bin Laden, the mastermind of the terrorist attacks; and later the invasion of Iraq to depose President Saddam Hussein, the tyrant who was wrongly believed to have weapons of mass destruction.\nRewarded for years of pushing campaign-finance reforms, Mr. McCain and Senator Russ Feingold, Democrat of Wisconsin, finally saw passage in 2002 of the McCain-Feingold Act. It banned a key source of financing for both parties, so-called soft money donated in unlimited amounts to build party strengths, and it limited donations for national candidates to “hard money,” subject to annual limits and other rules. The law’s effects became tangled in lawsuits, court rulings and financing schemes.\nAs a torture victim, Mr. McCain was sensitive to the detention and interrogation of detainees in the fight against terrorism. In 2005 the Senate passed his bill to bar inhumane treatment of prisoners, including those at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, by limiting military practices to those permitted by the United States Army Field Manual on Interrogation. His 2008 bill to ban waterboarding as torture was adopted, but vetoed by President Bush.\nMr. McCain wrote six books with his aide, Mark Salter, all with themes of courage. Besides his 2018 memoir, they were “Worth the Fighting For” (2002), “Why Courage Matters: The Way to a Braver Life” (2004), “Character Is Destiny: Inspiring Stories Every Young Person Should Know and Every Adult Should Remember” (2005), “Hard Call: Great Decisions and the Extraordinary People Who Made Them” (2007) and “Thirteen Soldiers: A Personal History of Americans at War” (2014).\nIn 1993, Mr. McCain gave the commencement address at Annapolis: the sorcerer’s apprentice, home to inspire the midshipmen. He spoke of Navy aviators hurled from the decks of pitching aircraft carriers, of Navy gunners blazing into the silhouettes of onrushing kamikazes, of trapped Marines battling overwhelming Chinese hordes in a breakout from the Chosin Reservoir in North Korea.\n“I have spent time in the company of heroes,” he said. “I have watched men suffer the anguish of imprisonment, defy appalling cruelty until further resistance is impossible, break for a moment, then recover inhuman strength to defy their enemies once more. All these things and more I have seen. And so will you. I will go to my grave in gratitude to my Creator for allowing me to stand witness to such courage and honor. And so will you.\n“My time is slipping by. Yours is fast approaching. You will know where your duty lies. You will know.”\nAdvertisement",
