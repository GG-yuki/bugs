SEBELIUS648 F. 3d 1235, affirmed in part and reversed in part.\nNOTE: Where it is feasible, a syllabus (headnote) will be released, as is being done in connection with this case, at the time the opinion is issued. The syllabus constitutes no part of the opinion of the Court but has been prepared by the Reporter of Decisions for the convenience of the reader. See United States v. Detroit Timber & Lumber Co., 200 U. S. 321, 337.\nSUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES\nSyllabus\nNATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT BUSINESS et al. v. SEBELIUS, SECRETARY OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, et al.\nIn 2010, Congress enacted the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act in order to increase the number of Americans covered by health insurance and decrease the cost of health care.  One key provision is the individual mandate, which requires most Americans to maintain “minimum essential” health insurance coverage.  26 U. S. C. §5000A.  For individuals who are not exempt, and who do not receive health insurance through an employer or government program, the means of satisfying the requirement is to purchase insurance from a private company.  Beginning in 2014, those who do not comply with the mandate must make a “[s]hared responsibility payment” to the Federal Government.  §5000A(b)(1).  The Act provides that this “penalty” will be paid to the Internal Revenue Service with an individual’s taxes, and “shall be assessed and collected in the same manner” as tax penalties.  §§5000A(c), (g)(1).\nAnother key provision of the Act is the Medicaid expansion.  The current Medicaid program offers federal funding to States to assist pregnant women, children, needy families, the blind, the elderly, and the disabled in obtaining medical care.  42 U. S. C. §1396d(a).  The Affordable Care Act expands the scope of the Medicaid program and increases the number of individuals the States must cover.  For ex ample, the Act requires state programs to provide Medicaid coverage by 2014 to adults with incomes up to 133 percent of the federal poverty level, whereas many States now cover adults with children only if their income is considerably lower, and do not cover childless adults at all.  §1396a(a)(10)(A)(i)(VIII).  The Act increases federal funding to cover the States’ costs in expanding Medicaid coverage.  §1396d(y)(1).  But if a State does not comply with the Act’s new coverage requirements, it may lose not only the federal funding for those requirements, but all of its federal Medicaid funds.  §1396c.\nTwenty-six States, several individuals, and the National Federation of Independent Business brought suit in Federal District Court, challenging the constitutionality of the individual mandate and the Medicaid expansion.  The Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit upheld the Medicaid expansion as a valid exercise of Congress’s spending power, but concluded that Congress lacked authority to enact the individual mandate.  Finding the mandate severable from the Act’s other provisions, the Eleventh Circuit left the rest of the Act intact.\nHeld: The judgment is affirmed in part and reversed in part.\n648 F. 3d 1235, affirmed in part and reversed in part.\n1. Chief Justice Roberts delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to Part II, concluding that the Anti-Injunction Act does not bar this suit.\nThe Anti-Injunction Act provides that “no suit for the purpose of restraining the assessment or collection of any tax shall be maintained in any court by any person,” 26 U. S. C. §7421(a), so that those subject to a tax must first pay it and then sue for a refund.  The present challenge seeks to restrain the collection of the shared responsibility payment from those who do not comply with the individual mandate.  But Congress did not intend the payment to be treated as a “tax” for purposes of the Anti-Injunction Act.  The Affordable Care Act describes the payment as a “penalty,” not a “tax.”  That label cannot control whether the payment is a tax for purposes of the Constitution, but it does determine the application of the Anti-Injunction Act.  The Anti-Injunction Act therefore does not bar this suit.  Pp. 11–15.\n2. Chief Justice Roberts concluded in Part III–A that the individual mandate is not a valid exercise of Congress’s power under the Commerce Clause and the Necessary and Proper Clause.  Pp. 16–30.\n(a) The Constitution grants Congress the power to “regulate Commerce.”  Art. I, §8, cl. 3 (emphasis added).  The power to regulate commerce presupposes the existence of commercial activity to be regulated.  This Court’s precedent reflects this understanding: As expansive as this Court’s cases construing the scope of the commerce  power have been, they uniformly describe the power as reaching “activity.”  E.g., United States v. Lopez, 514 U. S. 549, 560.  The individual mandate, however, does not regulate existing commercial activity.  It instead compels individuals to become active in commerce by purchasing a product, on the ground that their failure to do so affects interstate commerce.\nConstruing the Commerce Clause to permit Congress to regulate individuals precisely because they are doing nothing would open a new and potentially vast domain to congressional authority.  Congress already possesses expansive power to regulate what people do.  Upholding the Affordable Care Act under the Commerce Clause would give Congress the same license to regulate what people do not do.  The Framers knew the difference between doing something and doing nothing.  They gave Congress the power to regulate commerce, not to compel it.  Ignoring that distinction would undermine the principle that the Federal Government is a government of limited and enumerated powers.  The individual mandate thus cannot be sustained under Congress’s power to “regulate Commerce.”  Pp. 16–27.\n(b) Nor can the individual mandate be sustained under the Necessary and Proper Clause as an integral part of the Affordable Care Act’s other reforms.  Each of this Court’s prior cases upholding laws under that Clause involved exercises of authority derivative of, and in service to, a granted power.  E.g., United States v. Comstock, 560 U. S. ___.  The individual mandate, by contrast, vests Congress with the extraordinary ability to create the necessary predicate to the exercise of an enumerated power and draw within its regulatory scope those who would otherwise be outside of it.  Even if the individual mandate is “necessary” to the Affordable Care Act’s other reforms, such an expansion of federal power is not a “proper” means for making those reforms effective.  Pp. 27–30.\n3. Chief Justice Roberts concluded in Part III–B that the individual mandate must be construed as imposing a tax on those who do not have health insurance, if such a construction is reasonable.\nThe most straightforward reading of the individual mandate is that it commands individuals to purchase insurance.  But, for the reasons explained, the Commerce Clause does not give Congress that power.  It is therefore necessary to turn to the Government’s alternative argument: that the mandate may be upheld as within Congress’s power to “lay and collect Taxes.”  Art. I, §8, cl. 1.  In pressing its taxing power argument, the Government asks the Court to view the mandate as imposing a tax on those who do not buy that product.  Because “every reasonable construction must be resorted to, in order to save a statute from unconstitutionality,” Hooper v. California, 155 U. S. 648, 657, the question is whether it is “fairly possible” to inter pret the mandate as imposing such a tax, Crowell v. Benson, 285 U. S. 22, 62.  Pp. 31–32.\n4. Chief Justice Roberts delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to Part III–C, concluding that the individual mandate may be upheld as within Congress’s power under the Taxing Clause.  Pp. 33–44.\n(a) The Affordable Care Act describes the “[s]hared responsibility payment” as a “penalty,” not a “tax.”  That label is fatal to the application of the Anti-Injunction Act.  It does not, however, control whether an exaction is within Congress’s power to tax.  In answering that constitutional question, this Court follows a functional approach, “[d]isregarding the designation of the exaction, and viewing its substance and application.”  United States v. Constantine, 296 U. S. 287, 294.  Pp. 33–35.\n(b) Such an analysis suggests that the shared responsibility payment may for constitutional purposes be considered a tax.  The payment is not so high that there is really no choice but to buy health insurance; the payment is not limited to willful violations, as penalties for unlawful acts often are; and the payment is collected solely by the IRS through the normal means of taxation.  Cf. Bailey v. Drexel Furniture Co., 259 U. S. 20, 36–37.  None of this is to say that payment is not intended to induce the purchase of health insurance.  But the mandate need not be read to declare that failing to do so is unlawful.  Neither the Affordable Care Act nor any other law attaches negative legal consequences to not buying health insurance, beyond requiring a payment to the IRS.  And Congress’s choice of language—stating that individuals “shall” obtain insurance or pay a “penalty”—does not require reading §5000A as punishing unlawful conduct.  It may also be read as imposing a tax on those who go without insurance.  See New York v. United States, 505 U. S. 144, 169–174.  Pp. 35–40.\n(c) Even if the mandate may reasonably be characterized as a tax, it must still comply with the Direct Tax Clause, which provides: “No Capitation, or other direct, Tax shall be laid, unless in Proportion to the Census or Enumeration herein before directed to be taken.”  Art. I, §9, cl. 4.  A tax on going without health insurance is not like a capitation or other direct tax under this Court’s precedents.  It therefore need not be apportioned so that each State pays in proportion to its population.  Pp. 40–41.\n5. Chief Justice Roberts, joined by Justice Breyer and Justice Kagan, concluded in Part IV that the Medicaid expansion violates the Constitution by threatening States with the loss of their existing Medicaid funding if they decline to comply with the expansion.  Pp. 45–58.\n(a) The Spending Clause grants Congress the power “to pay the Debts and provide for the . . . general Welfare of the United States.”  Art. I, §8, cl. 1.  Congress may use this power to establish cooperative state-federal Spending Clause programs.  The legitimacy of Spending Clause legislation, however, depends on whether a State voluntarily and knowingly accepts the terms of such programs.  Pennhurst State School and Hospital v. Halderman, 451 U. S. 1, 17.  “[T]he Constitution simply does not give Congress the authority to require the States to regulate.”  New York v. United States, 505 U. S. 144, 178.  When Congress threatens to terminate other grants as a means of pressuring the States to accept a Spending Clause program, the legislation runs counter to this Nation’s system of federalism.  Cf. South Dakota v. Dole, 483 U. S. 203, 211.  Pp. 45–51.\n(b) Section 1396c gives the Secretary of Health and Human Services the authority to penalize States that choose not to participate in the Medicaid expansion by taking away their existing Medicaid funding.  42 U. S. C. §1396c.  The threatened loss of over 10 percent of a State’s overall budget is economic dragooning that leaves the States with no real option but to acquiesce in the Medicaid expansion.  The Government claims that the expansion is properly viewed as only a modification of the existing program, and that this modification is permissible because Congress reserved the “right to alter, amend, or repeal any provision” of Medicaid.  §1304.  But the expansion accomplishes a shift in kind, not merely degree.  The original program was designed to cover medical services for particular categories of vulnerable individuals.  Under the Affordable Care Act, Medicaid is transformed into a program to meet the health care needs of the entire nonelderly population with income below 133 percent of the poverty level.  A State could hardly anticipate that Congress’s reservation of the right to “alter” or “amend” the Medicaid program included the power to transform it so dramatically.  The Medicaid expansion thus violates the Constitution by threatening States with the loss of their existing Medicaid funding if they decline to comply with the expansion.  Pp. 51–55.\n(c) The constitutional violation is fully remedied by precluding the Secretary from applying §1396c to withdraw existing Medicaid funds for failure to comply with the requirements set out in the expansion.  See §1303.  The other provisions of the Affordable Care Act are not affected.  Congress would have wanted the rest of the Act to stand, had it known that States would have a genuine choice whether to participate in the Medicaid expansion.  Pp. 55–58.\n6. Justice Ginsburg, joined by Justice Sotomayor, is of the view that the Spending Clause does not preclude the Secretary from withholding Medicaid funds based on a State’s refusal to comply with the  expanded Medicaid program.  But given the majority view, she agrees with The Chief Justice’s conclusion in Part IV–B that the Medicaid Act’s severability clause, 42 U. S. C. §1303, determines the appropriate remedy.  Because The Chief Justice finds the withholding—not the granting—of federal funds incompatible with the Spending Clause, Congress’ extension of Medicaid remains available to any State that affirms its willingness to participate.  Even absent §1303’s command, the Court would have no warrant to invalidate the funding offered by the Medicaid expansion, and surely no basis to tear down the ACA in its entirety.  When a court confronts an unconstitutional statute, its endeavor must be to conserve, not destroy, the legislation.  See, e.g., Ayotte v. Planned Parenthood of Northern New Eng., 546 U. S. 320, 328–330.  Pp. 60–61.\nRoberts, C. J., announced the judgment of the Court and delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to Parts I, II, and III–C, in which Ginsburg, Breyer, Sotomayor, and Kagan, JJ., joined; an opinion with respect to Part IV, in which Breyer and Kagan, JJ., joined; and an opinion with respect to Parts III–A, III–B, and III–D.  Ginsburg, J., filed an opinion concurring in part, concurring in the judgment in part, and dissenting in part, in which Sotomayor, J., joined, and in which Breyer and Kagan, JJ., joined as to Parts I, II, III, and IV.

We do not consider whether the Act embodies sound policies.  That judgment is entrusted to the Nation’s elected leaders.  We ask only whether Congress has the power under the Constitution to enact the challenged provisions.\nIn our federal system, the National Government possesses only limited powers; the States and the people retain the remainder.  Nearly two centuries ago, Chief Justice Marshall observed that “the question respecting the extent of the powers actually granted” to the Federal Government “is perpetually arising, and will probably continue to arise, as long as our system shall exist.”  McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 405 (1819).  In this case we must again determine whether the Constitution grants Congress powers it now asserts, but which many States and individuals believe it does not possess.  Resolving this controversy requires us to examine both the limits of the Government’s power, and our own limited role in policing those boundaries.\nThe Federal Government “is acknowledged by all to be one of enumerated powers.”  Ibid.  That is, rather than granting general authority to perform all the conceiv-able functions of government, the Constitution lists, or enumerates, the Federal Government’s powers.  Congress may, for example, “coin Money,” “establish Post Offices,” and “raise and support Armies.”  Art. I, §8, cls. 5, 7, 12.  The enumeration of powers is also a limitation of pow- ers, because “[t]he enumeration presupposes something not enumerated.”  Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1, 195 (1824).  The Constitution’s express conferral of some powers makes clear that it does not grant others.  And the Federal  Government “can exercise only the powers granted to it.”  McCulloch, supra, at 405.\nToday, the restrictions on government power foremost in many Americans’ minds are likely to be affirmative pro-hibitions, such as contained in the Bill of Rights.  These affirmative prohibitions come into play, however, only where the Government possesses authority to act in the first place.  If no enumerated power authorizes Congress to pass a certain law, that law may not be enacted, even if it would not violate any of the express prohibitions in the Bill of Rights or elsewhere in the Constitution.\nIndeed, the Constitution did not initially include a Bill of Rights at least partly because the Framers felt the enu-meration of powers sufficed to restrain the Government.  As Alexander Hamilton put it, “the Constitution is itself, in every rational sense, and to every useful purpose, a bill of rights.”  The Federalist No. 84, p. 515 (C. Ros-siter ed. 1961).  And when the Bill of Rights was ratified, it made express what the enumeration of powers necessarily implied: “The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution . . . are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.”  U. S. Const., Amdt. 10.  The Federal Government has expanded dramatically over the past two centuries, but it still must show that a constitutional grant of power authorizes each of its actions.  See, e.g., United States v. Comstock, 560 U. S. ___ (2010).\nThe same does not apply to the States, because the Con-stitution is not the source of their power.  The Consti-tution may restrict state governments—as it does, for example, by forbidding them to deny any person the equal protection of the laws.  But where such prohibitions do not apply, state governments do not need constitutional au-thorization to act.  The States thus can and do perform many of the vital functions of modern government—punishing street crime, running public schools, and zoning property for development, to name but a few—even though  the Constitution’s text does not authorize any government to do so.  Our cases refer to this general power of governing, possessed by the States but not by the Federal Government, as the “police power.”  See, e.g., United States v. Morrison, 529 U. S. 598, 618–619 (2000).\n“State sovereignty is not just an end in itself: Rather, federalism secures to citizens the liberties that derive from the diffusion of sovereign power.”  New York v. United States, 505 U. S. 144, 181 (1992) (internal quotation marks omitted).  Because the police power is controlled by 50 different States instead of one national sovereign, the facets of governing that touch on citizens’ daily lives are normally administered by smaller governments closer to the governed.  The Framers thus ensured that powers which “in the ordinary course of affairs, concern the lives, liberties, and properties of the people” were held by governments more local and more accountable than a dis- tant federal bureaucracy.  The Federalist No. 45, at 293 (J. Madison).  The independent power of the States also serves as a check on the power of the Federal Government: “By denying any one government complete jurisdiction over all the concerns of public life, federalism protects the liberty of the individual from arbitrary power.”  Bond v. United States, 564 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 9–10).\nThis case concerns two powers that the Constitution does grant the Federal Government, but which must be read carefully to avoid creating a general federal authority akin to the police power.  The Constitution authorizes Congress to “regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes.”  Art. I, §8, cl. 3.  Our precedents read that to mean that Congress may regulate “the channels of interstate commerce,” “persons or things in interstate commerce,” and “those activities that substantially affect interstate commerce.”  Morrison, supra, at 609 (internal quotation marks omitted).  The power over activities that substantially  affect interstate commerce can be expansive.  That power has been held to authorize federal regulation of such seem-ingly local matters as a farmer’s decision to grow wheat for himself and his livestock, and a loan shark’s extor-tionate collections from a neighborhood butcher shop. See Wickard v. Filburn, 317 U. S. 111 (1942); Perez v. United States, 402 U. S. 146 (1971).\nCongress may also “lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises, to pay the Debts and provide for the common Defence and general Welfare of the United States.”  U. S. Const., Art. I, §8, cl. 1.  Put simply, Congress may tax and spend.  This grant gives the Federal Government considerable influence even in areas where it cannot directly regulate.  The Federal Government may enact a tax on an activity that it cannot authorize, forbid, or otherwise control.  See, e.g., License Tax Cases, 5 Wall. 462, 471 (1867).  And in exercising its spending power, Congress may offer funds to the States, and may condition those offers on compliance with specified conditions.  See, e.g., College Savings Bank v. Florida Prepaid Postsecondary Ed. Expense Bd., 527 U. S. 666, 686 (1999).  These offers may well induce the States to adopt policies that the Federal Government itself could not impose.  See, e.g., South Dakota v. Dole, 483 U. S. 203, 205–206 (1987) (conditioning federal highway funds on States raising their drinking age to 21).\nThe reach of the Federal Government’s enumerated powers is broader still because the Constitution authorizes Congress to “make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into Execution the foregoing Powers.”  Art. I, §8, cl. 18.  We have long read this provision to give Congress great latitude in exercising its powers: “Let the end be legitimate, let it be within the scope of the constitution, and all means which are appropriate, which are plainly adapted to that end, which are not prohibited, but consist with the letter and spirit of the constitution, are  constitutional.”  McCulloch, 4 Wheat., at 421.\nOur permissive reading of these powers is explained in part by a general reticence to invalidate the acts of the Nation’s elected leaders.  “Proper respect for a co-ordinate branch of the government” requires that we strike down an Act of Congress only if “the lack of constitutional authority to pass [the] act in question is clearly demonstrated.”  United States v. Harris, 106 U. S. 629, 635 (1883).  Members of this Court are vested with the authority to interpret the law; we possess neither the expertise nor the prerogative to make policy judgments.  Those decisions are entrusted to our Nation’s elected leaders, who can be thrown out of office if the people disagree with them.  It is not our job to protect the people from the consequences of their political choices.\nOur deference in matters of policy cannot, however, become abdication in matters of law.  “The powers of the legislature are defined and limited; and that those lim- its may not be mistaken, or forgotten, the constitution is written.”  Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137, 176 (1803).  Our respect for Congress’s policy judgments thus can never extend so far as to disavow restraints on federal power that the Constitution carefully constructed.  “The peculiar circumstances of the moment may render a measure more or less wise, but cannot render it more or less constitutional.”  Chief Justice John Marshall, A Friend of the Constitution No. V, Alexandria Gazette, July 5, 1819, in John Marshall’s Defense of McCulloch v. Maryland 190–191 (G. Gunther ed. 1969).  And there can be no question that it is the responsibility of this Court to enforce the limits on federal power by striking down acts of Congress that transgress those limits.  Marbury v. Madison, supra, at 175–176.\nThe questions before us must be considered against the background of these basic principles.\nIn 2010, Congress enacted the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, 124 Stat. 119.  The Act aims to increase the number of Americans covered by health in-surance and decrease the cost of health care.  The Act’s 10 titles stretch over 900 pages and contain hundreds of provisions.  This case concerns constitutional challenges to two key provisions, commonly referred to as the individual mandate and the Medicaid expansion.\nThe individual mandate requires most Americans to maintain “minimum essential” health insurance coverage.  26 U. S. C. §5000A.  The mandate does not apply to some individuals, such as prisoners and undocumented aliens.  §5000A(d).  Many individuals will receive the required cov-erage through their employer, or from a government program such as Medicaid or Medicare.  See §5000A(f).  But for individuals who are not exempt and do not receive health insurance through a third party, the means of satisfying the requirement is to purchase insurance from a private company.\nBeginning in 2014, those who do not comply with the mandate must make a “[s]hared responsibility payment” to the Federal Government.  §5000A(b)(1).  That payment, which the Act describes as a “penalty,” is calculated as a percentage of household income, subject to a floor based on a specified dollar amount and a ceiling based on the average annual premium the individual would have to pay for qualifying private health insurance.  §5000A(c).  In 2016, for example, the penalty will be 2.5 percent of an individ-ual’s household income, but no less than $695 and no more than the average yearly premium for insurance that covers 60 percent of the cost of 10 specified services (e.g., prescription drugs and hospitalization).  Ibid.; 42 U. S. C. §18022.  The Act provides that the penalty will be paid to the Internal Revenue Service with an individual’s taxes, and “shall be assessed and collected in the same manner”  as tax penalties, such as the penalty for claiming too large an income tax refund.  26 U. S. C. §5000A(g)(1).  The Act, however, bars the IRS from using several of its normal enforcement tools, such as criminal prosecutions and levies.  §5000A(g)(2).  And some individuals who are subject to the mandate are nonetheless exempt from the penalty—for example, those with income below a certain threshold and members of Indian tribes.  §5000A(e).\nOn the day the President signed the Act into law, Florida and 12 other States filed a complaint in the Federal District Court for the Northern District of Florida.  Those plaintiffs—who are both respondents and petitioners here, depending on the issue—were subsequently joined by 13 more States, several individuals, and the National Fed-eration of Independent Business.  The plaintiffs alleged, among other things, that the individual mandate provisions of the Act exceeded Congress’s powers under Article I of the Constitution.  The District Court agreed, holding that Congress lacked constitutional power to enact the individual mandate.  780 F. Supp. 2d 1256 (ND Fla. 2011).  The District Court determined that the individual mandate could not be severed from the remainder of the Act, and therefore struck down the Act in its entirety.  Id., at 1305–1306.\nThe Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit affirmed in part and reversed in part.  The court affirmed the District Court’s holding that the individual mandate exceeds Congress’s power.  648 F. 3d 1235 (2011).  The panel unanimously agreed that the individual mandate did not impose a tax, and thus could not be authorized by Congress’s power to “lay and collect Taxes.”  U. S. Const., Art. I, §8, cl. 1.  A majority also held that the individual mandate was not supported by Congress’s power to “regulate Commerce . . . among the several States.”  Id., cl. 3.  According to the majority, the Commerce Clause does not empower the Federal Government to order individuals to  engage in commerce, and the Government’s efforts to cast the individual mandate in a different light were unpersuasive.  Judge Marcus dissented, reasoning that the individual mandate regulates economic activity that has a clear effect on interstate commerce.\nHaving held the individual mandate to be unconstitutional, the majority examined whether that provision could be severed from the remainder of the Act.  The ma-jority determined that, contrary to the District Court’s view, it could.  The court thus struck down only the individual mandate, leaving the Act’s other provisions intact.  648 F. 3d, at 1328.\nOther Courts of Appeals have also heard challenges to the individual mandate.  The Sixth Circuit and the D. C. Circuit upheld the mandate as a valid exercise of Congress’s commerce power.  See Thomas More Law Center v. Obama, 651 F. 3d 529 (CA6 2011); Seven-Sky v. Holder, 661 F. 3d 1 (CADC 2011).  The Fourth Circuit determined that the Anti-Injunction Act prevents courts from considering the merits of that question.  See Liberty Univ., Inc. v. Geithner, 671 F. 3d 391 (2011).  That statute bars suits “for the purpose of restraining the assessment or collection of any tax.”  26 U. S. C. §7421(a).  A majority of the Fourth Circuit panel reasoned that the individual mandate’s penalty is a tax within the meaning of the Anti-Injunction Act, because it is a financial assessment collected by the IRS through the normal means of taxation.  The majority therefore determined that the plaintiffs could not challenge the individual mandate until after they paid the penalty.1\nThe second provision of the Affordable Care Act directly challenged here is the Medicaid expansion.  Enacted in 1965, Medicaid offers federal funding to States to assist pregnant women, children, needy families, the blind, the elderly, and the disabled in obtaining medical care.  See 42 U. S. C. §1396a(a)(10).  In order to receive that funding, States must comply with federal criteria governing matters such as who receives care and what services are provided at what cost.  By 1982 every State had chosen to participate in Medicaid.  Federal funds received through the Medicaid program have become a substantial part of state budgets, now constituting over 10 percent of most States’ total revenue.\nThe Affordable Care Act expands the scope of the Medicaid program and increases the number of individuals the States must cover.  For example, the Act requires state programs to provide Medicaid coverage to adults with incomes up to 133 percent of the federal poverty level, whereas many States now cover adults with children only if their income is considerably lower, and do not cover childless adults at all.  See §1396a(a)(10)(A)(i)(VIII).  The Act increases federal funding to cover the States’ costs in expanding Medicaid coverage, although States will bear a portion of the costs on their own.  §1396d(y)(1).  If a State does not comply with the Act’s new coverage requirements, it may lose not only the federal funding for those requirements, but all of its federal Medicaid funds.  See §1396c.\nAlong with their challenge to the individual mandate, the state plaintiffs in the Eleventh Circuit argued that the Medicaid expansion exceeds Congress’s constitutional  powers.  The Court of Appeals unanimously held that the Medicaid expansion is a valid exercise of Congress’s power under the Spending Clause.  U. S. Const., Art. I, §8, cl. 1.  And the court rejected the States’ claim that the threatened loss of all federal Medicaid funding violates the Tenth Amendment by coercing them into complying with the Medicaid expansion.  648 F. 3d, at 1264, 1268.\nWe granted certiorari to review the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit with respect to both the individual mandate and the Medicaid expansion.  565 U. S. ___ (2011).  Because no party supports the Eleventh Circuit’s holding that the individual mandate can be completely severed from the remainder of the Affordable Care Act, we appointed an amicus curiae to defend that aspect of the judgment below.  And because there is a reasonable argument that the Anti-Injunction Act deprives us of jurisdiction to hear challenges to the individ-ual mandate, but no party supports that proposition, we appointed an amicus curiae to advance it.2\nBefore turning to the merits, we need to be sure we have the authority to do so.  The Anti-Injunction Act provides that “no suit for the purpose of restraining the assessment or collection of any tax shall be maintained in any court by any person, whether or not such person is the per- son against whom such tax was assessed.”  26 U. S. C. §7421(a).  This statute protects the Government’s ability to collect a consistent stream of revenue, by barring litigation to enjoin or otherwise obstruct the collection of taxes.  Because of the Anti-Injunction Act, taxes can ordinarily be  challenged only after they are paid, by suing for a refund.  See Enochs v. Williams Packing & Nav. Co., 370 U. S. 1, 7–8 (1962).\nThe penalty for not complying with the Affordable Care Act’s individual mandate first becomes enforceable in 2014.  The present challenge to the mandate thus seeks to restrain the penalty’s future collection.  Amicus contends that the Internal Revenue Code treats the penalty as a tax, and that the Anti-Injunction Act therefore bars this suit.\nThe text of the pertinent statutes suggests otherwise.  The Anti-Injunction Act applies to suits “for the purpose of restraining the assessment or collection of any tax.”  §7421(a) (emphasis added).  Congress, however, chose to describe the “[s]hared responsibility payment” imposed on those who forgo health insurance not as a “tax,” but as a “penalty.”  §§5000A(b), (g)(2).  There is no immediate reason to think that a statute applying to “any tax” would apply to a “penalty.”\nCongress’s decision to label this exaction a “penalty” rather than a “tax” is significant because the Affordable Care Act describes many other exactions it creates as “taxes.”  See Thomas More, 651 F. 3d, at 551.  Where Congress uses certain language in one part of a statute and different language in another, it is generally presumed that Congress acts intentionally.  See Russello v. United States, 464 U. S. 16, 23 (1983).\nAmicus argues that even though Congress did not label the shared responsibility payment a tax, we should treat it as such under the Anti-Injunction Act because it functions like a tax.  It is true that Congress cannot change whether an exaction is a tax or a penalty for constitutional pur-poses simply by describing it as one or the other.  Congress may not, for example, expand its power under the Taxing Clause, or escape the Double Jeopardy Clause’s constraint on criminal sanctions, by labeling a severe financial pun- ishment a “tax.”  See Bailey v. Drexel Furniture Co., 259 U. S. 20, 36–37 (1922); Department of Revenue of Mont. v. Kurth Ranch, 511 U. S. 767, 779 (1994).\nThe Anti-Injunction Act and the Affordable Care Act, however, are creatures of Congress’s own creation.  How they relate to each other is up to Congress, and the best evidence of Congress’s intent is the statutory text.  We have thus applied the Anti-Injunction Act to statutorily described “taxes” even where that label was inaccurate.  See Bailey v. George, 259 U. S. 16 (1922) (Anti-Injunction Act applies to “Child Labor Tax” struck down as exceeding Congress’s taxing power in Drexel Furniture).\nCongress can, of course, describe something as a penalty but direct that it nonetheless be treated as a tax for purposes of the Anti-Injunction Act.  For example, 26 U. S. C. §6671(a) provides that “any reference in this title to ‘tax’ imposed by this title shall be deemed also to refer to the penalties and liabilities provided by” subchapter 68B of the Internal Revenue Code.  Penalties in subchapter 68B are thus treated as taxes under Title 26, which includes the Anti-Injunction Act.  The individual mandate, however, is not in subchapter 68B of the Code.  Nor does any other provision state that references to taxes in Title 26 shall also be “deemed” to apply to the individual mandate.\nAmicus attempts to show that Congress did render the Anti-Injunction Act applicable to the individual mandate, albeit by a more circuitous route.  Section 5000A(g)(1) spec-ifies that the penalty for not complying with the man- date “shall be assessed and collected in the same manner as an assessable penalty under subchapter B of chapter 68.”  Assessable penalties in subchapter 68B, in turn, “shall be assessed and collected in the same manner as taxes.”  §6671(a).  According to amicus, by directing that the penalty be “assessed and collected in the same man-ner as taxes,” §5000A(g)(1) made the Anti-Injunction Act applicable to this penalty.\nThe Government disagrees.  It argues that §5000A(g)(1) does not direct courts to apply the Anti-Injunction Act, because §5000A(g) is a directive only to the Secretary of the Treasury to use the same “ ‘methodology and procedures’ ” to collect the penalty that he uses to collect taxes.  Brief for United States 32–33 (quoting Seven-Sky, 661 F. 3d, at 11).\nWe think the Government has the better reading.  As it observes, “Assessment” and “Collection” are chapters of the Internal Revenue Code providing the Secretary author-ity to assess and collect taxes, and generally specifying the means by which he shall do so.  See §6201 (assess-ment authority); §6301 (collection authority).  Section 5000A(g)(1)’s command that the penalty be “assessed and collected in the same manner” as taxes is best read as referring to those chapters and giving the Secretary the same authority and guidance with respect to the penalty.  That interpretation is consistent with the remainder of §5000A(g), which instructs the Secretary on the tools he may use to collect the penalty.  See §5000A(g)(2)(A) (barring criminal prosecutions); §5000A(g)(2)(B) (prohibiting the Secretary from using notices of lien and levies).  The Anti-Injunction Act, by contrast, says nothing about the procedures to be used in assessing and collecting taxes.\nAmicus argues in the alternative that a different section of the Internal Revenue Code requires courts to treat the penalty as a tax under the Anti-Injunction Act.  Section 6201(a) authorizes the Secretary to make “assessments of all taxes (including interest, additional amounts, additions to the tax, and assessable penalties).”  (Emphasis added.)  Amicus contends that the penalty must be a tax, because it is an assessable penalty and §6201(a) says that taxes include assessable penalties.\nThat argument has force only if §6201(a) is read in isolation.  The Code contains many provisions treating taxes and assessable penalties as distinct terms.  See, e.g.,  §§860(h)(1), 6324A(a), 6601(e)(1)–(2), 6602, 7122(b).  There would, for example, be no need for §6671(a) to deem “tax” to refer to certain assessable penalties if the Code al- ready included all such penalties in the term “tax.”  Indeed, amicus’s earlier observation that the Code requires assessable penalties to be assessed and collected “in the same manner as taxes” makes little sense if assessable penalties are themselves taxes.  In light of the Code’s consistent distinction between the terms “tax” and “assessable penalty,” we must accept the Government’s in-terpretation: §6201(a) instructs the Secretary that his authority to assess taxes includes the authority to assess penalties, but it does not equate assessable penalties to taxes for other purposes.\nThe Affordable Care Act does not require that the penalty for failing to comply with the individual mandate be treated as a tax for purposes of the Anti-Injunction Act.  The Anti-Injunction Act therefore does not apply to this suit, and we may proceed to the merits.\nThe Government advances two theories for the proposition that Congress had constitutional authority to enact the individual mandate.  First, the Government argues that Congress had the power to enact the mandate under the Commerce Clause.  Under that theory, Congress may order individuals to buy health insurance because the failure to do so affects interstate commerce, and could un-dercut the Affordable Care Act’s other reforms.  Second, the Government argues that if the commerce power does not support the mandate, we should nonetheless uphold it as an exercise of Congress’s power to tax.  According to the Government, even if Congress lacks the power to direct individuals to buy insurance, the only effect of the individual mandate is to raise taxes on those who do not do so, and thus the law may be upheld as a tax.\nThe Government’s first argument is that the individual mandate is a valid exercise of Congress’s power under the Commerce Clause and the Necessary and Proper Clause.  According to the Government, the health care market is characterized by a significant cost-shifting problem.  Everyone will eventually need health care at a time and to an extent they cannot predict, but if they do not have insurance, they often will not be able to pay for it.  Because state and federal laws nonetheless require hospitals to provide a certain degree of care to individuals without regard to their ability to pay, see, e.g., 42 U. S. C. §1395dd; Fla. Stat. Ann. §395.1041, hospitals end up receiving compensation for only a portion of the services they provide.  To recoup the losses, hospitals pass on the cost to insurers through higher rates, and insurers, in turn, pass on the cost to policy holders in the form of higher premiums.  Congress estimated that the cost of uncompensated care raises family health insurance premiums, on average, by over $1,000 per year.  42 U. S. C. §18091(2)(F).\nIn the Affordable Care Act, Congress addressed the problem of those who cannot obtain insurance coverage because of preexisting conditions or other health issues.  It did so through the Act’s “guaranteed-issue” and “community- rating” provisions.  These provisions together prohibit insurance companies from denying coverage to those with such conditions or charging unhealthy individuals higher premiums than healthy individuals.  See §§300gg, 300gg–1, 300gg–3, 300gg–4.\nThe guaranteed-issue and community-rating reforms do not, however, address the issue of healthy individuals who choose not to purchase insurance to cover potential health care needs.  In fact, the reforms sharply exacerbate that problem, by providing an incentive for individuals to delay purchasing health insurance until they become sick, relying on the promise of guaranteed and affordable coverage.   The reforms also threaten to impose massive new costs on insurers, who are required to accept unhealthy individuals but prohibited from charging them rates necessary to pay for their coverage.  This will lead insurers to significantly increase premiums on everyone.  See Brief for America’s Health Insurance Plans et al. as Amici Curiae in No. 11–393 etc. 8–9.\nThe individual mandate was Congress’s solution to these problems.  By requiring that individuals purchase health insurance, the mandate prevents cost-shifting by those who would otherwise go without it.  In addition, the mandate forces into the insurance risk pool more healthy individuals, whose premiums on average will be higher than their health care expenses.  This allows insurers to subsidize the costs of covering the unhealthy individuals the reforms require them to accept.  The Government claims that Congress has power under the Commerce and Necessary and Proper Clauses to enact this solution.\nThe Government contends that the individual mandate is within Congress’s power because the failure to pur-chase insurance “has a substantial and deleterious effect on interstate commerce” by creating the cost-shifting prob-lem.  Brief for United States 34.  The path of our Commerce Clause decisions has not always run smooth, see United States v. Lopez, 514 U. S. 549, 552–559 (1995), but it is now well established that Congress has broad authority under the Clause.  We have recognized, for example, that “[t]he power of Congress over interstate commerce is not confined to the regulation of commerce among the states,” but extends to activities that “have a substantial effect on interstate commerce.”  United States v. Darby, 312 U. S. 100, 118–119 (1941).  Congress’s power, more-over, is not limited to regulation of an activity that by itself substantially affects interstate commerce, but also extends  to activities that do so only when aggregated with similar activities of others.  See Wickard, 317 U. S., at 127–128.\nGiven its expansive scope, it is no surprise that Congress has employed the commerce power in a wide variety of ways to address the pressing needs of the time.  But Congress has never attempted to rely on that power to compel individuals not engaged in commerce to purchase an unwanted product.3  Legislative novelty is not nec-essarily fatal; there is a first time for everything.  But sometimes “the most telling indication of [a] severe con-stitutional problem . . . is the lack of historical precedent” for Congress’s action.  Free Enterprise Fund v. Public Company Accounting Oversight Bd., 561 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 25) (internal quotation marks omitted).  At the very least, we should “pause to consider the implications of the Government’s arguments” when confronted with such new conceptions of federal power.  Lopez, supra, at 564.\nThe Constitution grants Congress the power to “regulate Commerce.”  Art. I, §8, cl. 3 (emphasis added).  The power to regulate commerce presupposes the existence of commercial activity to be regulated.  If the power to “regulate” something included the power to create it, many of the provisions in the Constitution would be superfluous.  For example, the Constitution gives Congress the power to “coin Money,” in addition to the power to “regulate the Value thereof.”  Id., cl. 5.  And it gives Congress the power  to “raise and support Armies” and to “provide and maintain a Navy,” in addition to the power to “make Rules for the Government and Regulation of the land and naval Forces.”  Id., cls. 12–14.  If the power to regulate the armed forces or the value of money included the power to bring the subject of the regulation into existence, the specific grant of such powers would have been unnecessary.  The language of the Constitution reflects the natural understanding that the power to regulate assumes there is already something to be regulated.  See Gibbons, 9 Wheat., at 188 (“[T]he enlightened patriots who framed our constitution, and the people who adopted it, must be understood to have employed words in their natural sense, and to have intended what they have said”).4\nOur precedent also reflects this understanding.  As expansive as our cases construing the scope of the commerce power have been, they all have one thing in common: They uniformly describe the power as reaching “activity.”  It is nearly impossible to avoid the word when quoting them.  See, e.g., Lopez, supra, at 560 (“Where economic activity substantially affects interstate commerce, legislation regulating that activity will be sus tained”); Perez, 402 U. S., at 154 (“Where the class of activities is regulated and that class is within the reach of federal power, the courts have no power to excise, as trivial, individual instances of the class” (emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted)); Wickard, supra, at 125 (“[E]ven if appellee’s activity be local and though it may not be regarded as commerce, it may still, whatever its nature, be reached by Congress if it exerts a substantial economic effect on interstate commerce”); NLRB v. Jones & Laughlin Steel Corp., 301 U. S. 1, 37 (1937) (“Although activities may be intrastate in character when separately considered, if they have such a close and substantial relation to interstate commerce that their control is essential or appropriate to protect that commerce from burdens and obstructions, Congress cannot be denied the power to exercise that control”); see also post, at 15, 25–26, 28, 32 (Ginsburg, J., concurring in part, concurring in judgment in part, and dissenting in part).5\nThe individual mandate, however, does not regulate existing commercial activity.  It instead compels individ-uals to become active in commerce by purchasing a product, on the ground that their failure to do so affects interstate commerce.  Construing the Commerce Clause to permit Con-gress to regulate individuals precisely because they are doing nothing would open a new and potentially vast do-main to congressional authority.  Every day individuals do not do an infinite number of things.  In some cases they  decide not to do something; in others they simply fail to do it.  Allowing Congress to justify federal regulation by pointing to the effect of inaction on commerce would bring countless decisions an individual could potentially make within the scope of federal regulation, and—under the Government’s theory—empower Congress to make those decisions for him.\nApplying the Government’s logic to the familiar case of Wickard v. Filburn shows how far that logic would carry us from the notion of a government of limited powers.  In Wickard, the Court famously upheld a federal penalty im-posed on a farmer for growing wheat for consumption on his own farm.  317 U. S., at 114–115, 128–129.  That amount of wheat caused the farmer to exceed his quota under a program designed to support the price of wheat by limiting supply.  The Court rejected the farmer’s argument that growing wheat for home consumption was beyond the reach of the commerce power.  It did so on the ground that the farmer’s decision to grow wheat for his own use allowed him to avoid purchasing wheat in the market.  That decision, when considered in the aggregate along with sim-ilar decisions of others, would have had a substantial ef-fect on the interstate market for wheat.  Id., at 127–129.\nWickard has long been regarded as “perhaps the most far reaching example of Commerce Clause authority over intrastate activity,” Lopez, 514 U. S., at 560, but the Government’s theory in this case would go much further.  Under Wickard it is within Congress’s power to regulate the market for wheat by supporting its price.  But price can be supported by increasing demand as well as by decreasing supply.  The aggregated decisions of some consumers not to purchase wheat have a substantial effect on the price of wheat, just as decisions not to purchase health insurance have on the price of insurance.  Congress can therefore command that those not buying wheat do so, just as it argues here that it may command that those not  buying health insurance do so.  The farmer in Wickard was at least actively engaged in the production of wheat, and the Government could regulate that activity because of its effect on commerce.  The Government’s theory here would effectively override that limitation, by establishing that individuals may be regulated under the Commerce Clause whenever enough of them are not doing something the Government would have them do.\nIndeed, the Government’s logic would justify a mandatory purchase to solve almost any problem.  See Seven-Sky, 661 F. 3d, at 14–15 (noting the Government’s inability to “identify any mandate to purchase a product or ser- vice in interstate commerce that would be unconstitu-tional” under its theory of the commerce power).  To consider a different example in the health care market, many Americans do not eat a balanced diet.  That group makes up a larger percentage of the total population than those without health insurance.  See, e.g., Dept. of Agriculture and Dept. of Health and Human Services, Dietary Guidelines for Americans 1 (2010).  The failure of that group to have a healthy diet increases health care costs, to a greater extent than the failure of the uninsured to purchase insurance.  See, e.g., Finkelstein, Trogdon, Cohen, & Dietz, Annual Medical Spending Attributable to Obesity: Payer- and Service-Specific Estimates, 28 Health Affairs w822 (2009) (detailing the “undeniable link between ris-ing rates of obesity and rising medical spending,” and esti-mating that “the annual medical burden of obesity has risen to almost 10 percent of all medical spending and could amount to $147 billion per year in 2008”).  Those in-creased costs are borne in part by other Americans who must pay more, just as the uninsured shift costs to the insured.  See Center for Applied Ethics, Voluntary Health Risks: Who Should Pay?, 6 Issues in Ethics 6 (1993) (noting “overwhelming evidence that individuals with unhealthy habits pay only a fraction of the costs associated  with their behaviors; most of the expense is borne by the rest of society in the form of higher insurance premiums, government expenditures for health care, and disability benefits”).  Congress addressed the insurance problem by ordering everyone to buy insurance.  Under the Gov-ernment’s theory, Congress could address the diet problem by ordering everyone to buy vegetables.  See Dietary Guidelines, supra, at 19 (“Improved nutrition, appropriate eating behaviors, and increased physical activity have tre-mendous potential to . . . reduce health care costs”).\nPeople, for reasons of their own, often fail to do things that would be good for them or good for society.  Those failures—joined with the similar failures of others—can readily have a substantial effect on interstate commerce.  Under the Government’s logic, that authorizes Congress to use its commerce power to compel citizens to act as the Government would have them act.\nThat is not the country the Framers of our Constitution envisioned.  James Madison explained that the Commerce Clause was “an addition which few oppose and from which no apprehensions are entertained.”  The Federalist No. 45, at 293.  While Congress’s authority under the Commerce Clause has of course expanded with the growth of the national economy, our cases have “always recognized that the power to regulate commerce, though broad indeed, has limits.”  Maryland v. Wirtz, 392 U. S. 183, 196 (1968).  The Government’s theory would erode those limits, permitting Congress to reach beyond the natural extent of its authority, “everywhere extending the sphere of its activity and drawing all power into its impetuous vortex.”  The Federalist No. 48, at 309 (J. Madison).  Congress already enjoys vast power to regulate much of what we do.  Accepting the Government’s theory would give Congress the same license to regulate what we do not do, fundamentally changing the relation between the citizen and the Federal  Government.6\nTo an economist, perhaps, there is no difference between activity and inactivity; both have measurable economic effects on commerce.  But the distinction between doing something and doing nothing would not have been lost on the Framers, who were “practical statesmen,” not metaphysical philosophers.  Industrial Union Dept., AFL–CIO v. American Petroleum Institute, 448 U. S. 607, 673 (1980) (Rehnquist, J., concurring in judgment).  As we have ex-plained, “the framers of the Constitution were not mere visionaries, toying with speculations or theories, but practical men, dealing with the facts of political life as they understood them, putting into form the government they were creating, and prescribing in language clear and intelligible the powers that government was to take.”  South Carolina v. United States, 199 U. S. 437, 449 (1905).  The Framers gave Congress the power to regulate commerce, not to compel it, and for over 200 years both our decisions and Congress’s actions have reflected this understanding.  There is no reason to depart from that understanding now.\nThe Government sees things differently.  It argues that because sickness and injury are unpredictable but unavoidable, “the uninsured as a class are active in the market for health care, which they regularly seek and obtain.”  Brief for United States 50.  The individual mandate “merely regulates how individuals finance and pay for that  active participation—requiring that they do so through insurance, rather than through attempted self-insurance with the back-stop of shifting costs to others.”  Ibid.\nThe Government repeats the phrase “active in the market for health care” throughout its brief, see id., at 7, 18, 34, 50, but that concept has no constitutional significance.  An individual who bought a car two years ago and may buy another in the future is not “active in the car market” in any pertinent sense.  The phrase “active in the market” cannot obscure the fact that most of those regulated by the individual mandate are not currently engaged in any commercial activity involving health care, and that fact is fatal to the Government’s effort to “regulate the uninsured as a class.”  Id., at 42.  Our precedents recognize Congress’s power to regulate “class[es] of activities,” Gonzales v. Raich, 545 U. S. 1, 17 (2005) (emphasis added), not classes of individuals, apart from any activity in which they are engaged, see, e.g., Perez, 402 U. S., at 153 (“Petitioner is clearly a member of the class which engages in ‘extortionate credit transactions’ . . .” (emphasis deleted)).\nThe individual mandate’s regulation of the uninsured as a class is, in fact, particularly divorced from any link to existing commercial activity.  The mandate primarily affects healthy, often young adults who are less likely to need significant health care and have other priorities for spending their money.  It is precisely because these individuals, as an actuarial class, incur relatively low health care costs that the mandate helps counter the effect of forcing insurance companies to cover others who impose greater costs than their premiums are allowed to reflect.  See 42 U. S. C. §18091(2)(I) (recognizing that the mandate would “broaden the health insurance risk pool to include healthy individuals, which will lower health insurance premiums”).  If the individual mandate is targeted at a class, it is a class whose commercial inactivity rather than activity is its defining feature.\nThe Government, however, claims that this does not matter.  The Government regards it as sufficient to trigger Congress’s authority that almost all those who are uninsured will, at some unknown point in the future, engage in a health care transaction.  Asserting that “[t]here is no temporal limitation in the Commerce Clause,” the Government argues that because “[e]veryone subject to this regulation is in or will be in the health care market,” they can be “regulated in advance.”  Tr. of Oral Arg. 109 (Mar. 27, 2012).\nThe proposition that Congress may dictate the conduct of an individual today because of prophesied future ac-tivity finds no support in our precedent.  We have said that Congress can anticipate the effects on commerce of an eco-nomic activity.  See, e.g., Consolidated Edison Co. v. NLRB, 305 U. S. 197 (1938) (regulating the labor practices of  utility companies); Heart of Atlanta Motel, Inc. v. United States, 379 U. S. 241 (1964) (prohibiting discrimination by hotel operators); Katzenbach v. McClung, 379 U. S. 294 (1964) (prohibiting discrimination by restaurant owners).  But we have never permitted Congress to anticipate that activity itself in order to regulate individuals not currently engaged in commerce.  Each one of our cases, including those cited by Justice Ginsburg, post, at 20–21, involved preexisting economic activity.  See, e.g., Wickard, 317 U. S., at 127–129 (producing wheat); Raich, supra, at 25 (growing marijuana).\nEveryone will likely participate in the markets for food, clothing, transportation, shelter, or energy; that does not authorize Congress to direct them to purchase particular products in those or other markets today.  The Commerce Clause is not a general license to regulate an individual from cradle to grave, simply because he will predictably engage in particular transactions.  Any police power to regulate individuals as such, as opposed to their activities, remains vested in the States.\nThe Government argues that the individual mandate can be sustained as a sort of exception to this rule, because health insurance is a unique product.  According to the Government, upholding the individual mandate would not justify mandatory purchases of items such as cars or broccoli because, as the Government puts it, “[h]ealth in-surance is not purchased for its own sake like a car or broccoli; it is a means of financing health-care consumption and covering universal risks.”  Reply Brief for United States 19.  But cars and broccoli are no more purchased for their “own sake” than health insurance.  They are purchased to cover the need for transportation and food.\nThe Government says that health insurance and health care financing are “inherently integrated.”  Brief for United States 41.  But that does not mean the compelled purchase of the first is properly regarded as a regulation of the second.  No matter how “inherently integrated” health insurance and health care consumption may be, they are not the same thing: They involve different transactions, entered into at different times, with different providers.  And for most of those targeted by the mandate, significant health care needs will be years, or even decades, away.  The proximity and degree of connection between the mandate and the subsequent commercial activity is too lack-ing to justify an exception of the sort urged by the Gov- ernment.  The individual mandate forces individuals into commerce precisely because they elected to refrain from commercial activity.  Such a law cannot be sus- tained under a clause authorizing Congress to “regulate Commerce.”\nThe Government next contends that Congress has the power under the Necessary and Proper Clause to enact the individual mandate because the mandate is an “integral part of a comprehensive scheme of economic regulation”— the guaranteed-issue and community-rating insurance reforms.  Brief for United States 24.  Under this argument, it is not necessary to consider the effect that an individual’s inactivity may have on interstate commerce; it is enough that Congress regulate commercial activity in a way that requires regulation of inactivity to be effective.\nThe power to “make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into Execution” the powers enumerated in the Constitution, Art. I, §8, cl. 18, vests Congress with authority to enact provisions “incidental to the [enumerated] power, and conducive to its beneficial exercise,” McCulloch, 4 Wheat., at 418.  Although the Clause gives Congress authority to “legislate on that vast mass of incidental powers which must be involved in the con-stitution,” it does not license the exercise of any “great substantive and independent power[s]” beyond those specifi-cally enumerated.  Id., at 411, 421.  Instead, the Clause is “ ‘merely a declaration, for the removal of all uncertainty, that the means of carrying into execution those [powers] otherwise granted are included in the grant.’ ”  Kinsella v. United States ex rel. Singleton, 361 U. S. 234, 247 (1960) (quoting VI Writings of James Madison 383 (G. Hunt ed. 1906)).\nAs our jurisprudence under the Necessary and Proper Clause has developed, we have been very deferential to Congress’s determination that a regulation is “necessary.”  We have thus upheld laws that are “ ‘convenient, or use-ful’ or ‘conducive’ to the authority’s ‘beneficial exercise.’ ”  Comstock, 560 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 5) (quoting McCulloch, supra, at 413, 418).  But we have also carried out our responsibility to declare unconstitutional those laws that undermine the structure of government established by the Constitution.  Such laws, which are not “consist[ent] with the letter and spirit of the constitution,” McCulloch, supra, at 421, are not “proper [means] for carrying into Execution” Congress’s enumerated powers.  Rather, they are, “in  the words of The Federalist, ‘merely acts of usurpation’ which ‘deserve to be treated as such.’ ”  Printz v. United States, 521 U. S. 898, 924 (1997) (alterations omitted) (quoting The Federalist No. 33, at 204 (A. Hamilton)); see also New York, 505 U. S., at 177; Comstock, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 5) (Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment) (“It is of fundamental importance to consider whether essential attributes of state sovereignty are compromised by the assertion of federal power under the Necessary and Proper Clause . . .”).\nApplying these principles, the individual mandate cannot be sustained under the Necessary and Proper Clause as an essential component of the insurance reforms.  Each of our prior cases upholding laws under that Clause involved exercises of authority derivative of, and in service to, a granted power.  For example, we have upheld provisions permitting continued confinement of those already in federal custody when they could not be safely released, Comstock, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 1–2); criminaliz- ing bribes involving organizations receiving federal funds, Sabri v. United States, 541 U. S. 600, 602, 605 (2004); and tolling state statutes of limitations while cases are pending in federal court, Jinks v. Richland County, 538 U. S. 456, 459, 462 (2003).  The individual mandate, by con-trast, vests Congress with the extraordinary ability to create the necessary predicate to the exercise of an enumerated power.\nThis is in no way an authority that is “narrow in scope,” Comstock, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 20), or “incidental” to the exercise of the commerce power, McCulloch, supra, at 418.  Rather, such a conception of the Necessary and Proper Clause would work a substantial expansion of federal authority.  No longer would Congress be limited to regulating under the Commerce Clause those who by some preexisting activity bring themselves within the sphere of federal regulation.  Instead, Congress could reach beyond  the natural limit of its authority and draw within its regulatory scope those who otherwise would be outside of it.  Even if the individual mandate is “necessary” to the Act’s insurance reforms, such an expansion of federal power is not a “proper” means for making those reforms effective.\nThe Government relies primarily on our decision in Gonzales v. Raich.  In Raich, we considered “comprehensive legislation to regulate the interstate market” in marijuana.  545 U. S., at 22.  Certain individuals sought an exemption from that regulation on the ground that they engaged in only intrastate possession and consumption.  We denied any exemption, on the ground that marijuana is a fungible commodity, so that any marijuana could be readily diverted into the interstate market.  Congress’s attempt to regulate the interstate market for marijuana would therefore have been substantially undercut if it could not also regulate intrastate possession and consumption.  Id., at 19.  Accordingly, we recognized that “Congress was acting well within its authority” under the Necessary and Proper Clause even though its “regulation ensnare[d] some purely intrastate activity.”  Id., at 22; see also Perez, 402 U. S., at 154.  Raich thus did not involve the exercise of any “great substantive and independent power,” McCulloch, supra, at 411, of the sort at issue here.  Instead, it concerned only the constitutionality of “individual applications of a concededly valid statutory scheme.”  Raich, supra, at 23 (emphasis added).\nJust as the individual mandate cannot be sustained as a law regulating the substantial effects of the failure to purchase health insurance, neither can it be upheld as a “necessary and proper” component of the insurance re-forms.  The commerce power thus does not authorize the mandate.  Accord, post, at 4–16 (joint opinion of Scalia, Kennedy, Thomas, and Alito, JJ., dissenting).\nThat is not the end of the matter.  Because the Commerce Clause does not support the individual mandate, it is necessary to turn to the Government’s second argument: that the mandate may be upheld as within Congress’s enumerated power to “lay and collect Taxes.”  Art. I, §8, cl. 1.\nThe Government’s tax power argument asks us to view the statute differently than we did in considering its commerce power theory.  In making its Commerce Clause argument, the Government defended the mandate as a regulation requiring individuals to purchase health in-surance.  The Government does not claim that the taxing power allows Congress to issue such a command.  Instead, the Government asks us to read the mandate not as ordering individuals to buy insurance, but rather as imposing a tax on those who do not buy that product.\nThe text of a statute can sometimes have more than one possible meaning.  To take a familiar example, a law that reads “no vehicles in the park” might, or might not, ban bicycles in the park.  And it is well established that if a statute has two possible meanings, one of which violates the Constitution, courts should adopt the meaning that does not do so.  Justice Story said that 180 years ago: “No court ought, unless the terms of an act rendered it unavoidable, to give a construction to it which should involve a violation, however unintentional, of the constitution.”  Parsons v. Bedford, 3 Pet. 433, 448–449 (1830).  Justice Holmes made the same point a century later: “[T]he rule is settled that as between two possible interpretations of a statute, by one of which it would be unconstitutional and by the other valid, our plain duty is to adopt that which will save the Act.”  Blodgett v. Holden, 275 U. S. 142, 148 (1927) (concurring opinion).\nThe most straightforward reading of the mandate is that it commands individuals to purchase insurance.   After all, it states that individuals “shall” maintain health insurance.  26 U. S. C. §5000A(a).  Congress thought it could enact such a command under the Commerce Clause, and the Government primarily defended the law on that basis.  But, for the reasons explained above, the Commerce Clause does not give Congress that power.  Under our precedent, it is therefore necessary to ask whether the Government’s alternative reading of the statute—that it only imposes a tax on those without insurance—is a reasonable one.\nUnder the mandate, if an individual does not maintain health insurance, the only consequence is that he must make an additional payment to the IRS when he pays his taxes.  See §5000A(b).  That, according to the Government, means the mandate can be regarded as establishing a condition—not owning health insurance—that triggers a tax—the required payment to the IRS.  Under that theory, the mandate is not a legal command to buy insurance.  Rather, it makes going without insurance just another thing the Government taxes, like buying gasoline or earning income.  And if the mandate is in effect just a tax hike on certain taxpayers who do not have health insurance, it may be within Congress’s constitutional power to tax.\nThe question is not whether that is the most natural interpretation of the mandate, but only whether it is a “fairly possible” one.  Crowell v. Benson, 285 U. S. 22, 62 (1932).  As we have explained, “every reasonable construction must be resorted to, in order to save a statute from unconstitutionality.”  Hooper v. California, 155 U. S. 648, 657 (1895).  The Government asks us to interpret the mandate as imposing a tax, if it would otherwise violate the Constitution.  Granting the Act the full measure of deference owed to federal statutes, it can be so read, for the reasons set forth below.\nThe exaction the Affordable Care Act imposes on those without health insurance looks like a tax in many respects.  The “[s]hared responsibility payment,” as the statute entitles it, is paid into the Treasury by “taxpayer[s]” when they file their tax returns.  26 U. S. C. §5000A(b).  It does not apply to individuals who do not pay federal income taxes because their household income is less than the filing threshold in the Internal Revenue Code.  §5000A(e)(2).  For taxpayers who do owe the payment, its amount is determined by such familiar factors as taxable income, number of dependents, and joint filing status.  §§5000A(b)(3), (c)(2), (c)(4).  The requirement to pay is found in the Internal Revenue Code and enforced by the IRS, which—as we previously explained—must assess and collect it “in the same manner as taxes.”  Supra, at 13–14.  This process yields the essential feature of any tax: it produces at least some revenue for the Government.  United States v. Kahriger, 345 U. S. 22, 28, n. 4 (1953).  Indeed, the payment is expected to raise about $4 billion per year by 2017.  Congressional Budget Office, Payments of Penalties for Being Uninsured Under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Apr. 30, 2010), in Selected CBO Publications Related to Health Care Legislation, 2009–2010, p. 71 (rev. 2010).\nIt is of course true that the Act describes the payment as a “penalty,” not a “tax.”  But while that label is fatal to the application of the Anti-Injunction Act, supra, at 12–13, it does not determine whether the payment may be viewed as an exercise of Congress’s taxing power.  It is up to Con-gress whether to apply the Anti-Injunction Act to any particular statute, so it makes sense to be guided by Congress’s choice of label on that question.  That choice does not, however, control whether an exaction is within Congress’s constitutional power to tax.\nOur precedent reflects this: In 1922, we decided two  challenges to the “Child Labor Tax” on the same day.  In the first, we held that a suit to enjoin collection of the so-called tax was barred by the Anti-Injunction Act.  George, 259 U. S., at 20.  Congress knew that suits to obstruct taxes had to await payment under the Anti-Injunction Act; Congress called the child labor tax a tax; Congress therefore intended the Anti-Injunction Act to apply.  In the second case, however, we held that the same exaction, although labeled a tax, was not in fact authorized by Con-gress’s taxing power.  Drexel Furniture, 259 U. S., at 38.  That constitutional question was not controlled by Congress’s choice of label.\nWe have similarly held that exactions not labeled taxes nonetheless were authorized by Congress’s power to tax.  In the License Tax Cases, for example, we held that federal licenses to sell liquor and lottery tickets—for which the licensee had to pay a fee—could be sustained as exercises of the taxing power.  5 Wall., at 471.  And in New York v. United States we upheld as a tax a “surcharge” on out-of-state nuclear waste shipments, a portion of which was paid to the Federal Treasury.  505 U. S., at 171.  We thus ask whether the shared responsibility payment falls within Congress’s taxing power, “[d]isregarding the designa-tion of the exaction, and viewing its substance and application.”  United States v. Constantine, 296 U. S. 287, 294 (1935); cf. Quill Corp. v. North Dakota, 504 U. S. 298, 310 (1992) (“[M]agic words or labels” should not “disable an otherwise constitutional levy” (internal quotation marks omitted)); Nelson v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 312 U. S. 359, 363 (1941) (“In passing on the constitutionality of a tax law, we are concerned only with its practical operation, not its definition or the precise form of descriptive words which may be applied to it” (internal quotation marks omitted)); United States v. Sotelo, 436 U. S. 268, 275 (1978) (“That the funds due are referred to as a ‘penalty’  . . . does not alter their essential character as taxes”).7\nOur cases confirm this functional approach.  For example, in Drexel Furniture, we focused on three practical characteristics of the so-called tax on employing child laborers that convinced us the “tax” was actually a penalty.  First, the tax imposed an exceedingly heavy burden—10 percent of a company’s net income—on those who employed children, no matter how small their infraction.  Second, it imposed that exaction only on those who knowingly employed underage laborers.  Such scienter require-ments are typical of punitive statutes, because Congress often wishes to punish only those who intentionally break the law.  Third, this “tax” was enforced in part by the Department of Labor, an agency responsible for pun-ishing violations of labor laws, not collecting revenue.  259 U. S., at 36–37; see also, e.g., Kurth Ranch, 511 U. S., at 780–782 (considering, inter alia, the amount of the exaction, and the fact that it was imposed for violation of a separate criminal law); Constantine, supra, at 295 (same).\nThe same analysis here suggests that the shared responsibility payment may for constitutional purposes be considered a tax, not a penalty: First, for most Americans the amount due will be far less than the price of insurance, and, by statute, it can never be more.8  It may often  be a reasonable financial decision to make the payment rather than purchase insurance, unlike the “prohibitory” financial punishment in Drexel Furniture.  259 U. S., at 37.  Second, the individual mandate contains no scienter requirement.  Third, the payment is collected solely by the IRS through the normal means of taxation—except that the Service is not allowed to use those means most suggestive of a punitive sanction, such as criminal prosecution.  See §5000A(g)(2).  The reasons the Court in Drexel Furniture held that what was called a “tax” there was a penalty support the conclusion that what is called a “penalty” here may be viewed as a tax.9\nNone of this is to say that the payment is not intended to affect individual conduct.  Although the payment will raise considerable revenue, it is plainly designed to expand health insurance coverage.  But taxes that seek to influence conduct are nothing new.  Some of our earliest federal taxes sought to deter the purchase of imported manufactured goods in order to foster the growth of domestic industry.  See W. Brownlee, Federal Taxation in America 22 (2d ed. 2004); cf. 2 J. Story, Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States §962, p. 434 (1833) (“the taxing power is often, very often, applied for other purposes, than revenue”).  Today, federal and state taxes can compose more than half the retail price of cigarettes,  not just to raise more money, but to encourage people to quit smoking.  And we have upheld such obviously regulatory measures as taxes on selling marijuana and sawed-off shotguns.  See United States v. Sanchez, 340 U. S. 42, 44–45 (1950); Sonzinsky v. United States, 300 U. S. 506, 513 (1937).  Indeed, “[e]very tax is in some measure regula-tory.  To some extent it interposes an economic impediment to the activity taxed as compared with others not taxed.”  Sonzinsky, supra, at 513.  That §5000A seeks to shape decisions about whether to buy health insurance does not mean that it cannot be a valid exercise of the taxing power.\nIn distinguishing penalties from taxes, this Court has explained that “if the concept of penalty means anything, it means punishment for an unlawful act or omission.”  United States v. Reorganized CF&I Fabricators of Utah, Inc., 518 U. S. 213, 224 (1996); see also United States v. La Franca, 282 U. S. 568, 572 (1931) (“[A] penalty, as the word is here used, is an exaction imposed by statute as punishment for an unlawful act”).  While the individual mandate clearly aims to induce the purchase of health insurance, it need not be read to declare that failing to do so is unlawful.  Neither the Act nor any other law attaches negative legal consequences to not buying health insurance, beyond requiring a payment to the IRS.  The Government agrees with that reading, confirming that if someone chooses to pay rather than obtain health insurance, they have fully complied with the law.  Brief for United States 60–61; Tr. of Oral Arg. 49–50 (Mar. 26, 2012).\nIndeed, it is estimated that four million people each year will choose to pay the IRS rather than buy insurance.  See Congressional Budget Office, supra, at 71.  We would expect Congress to be troubled by that prospect if such conduct were unlawful.  That Congress apparently regards such extensive failure to comply with the mandate as  tolerable suggests that Congress did not think it was creating four million outlaws.  It suggests instead that the shared responsibility payment merely imposes a tax citizens may lawfully choose to pay in lieu of buying health insurance.\nThe plaintiffs contend that Congress’s choice of language—stating that individuals “shall” obtain insurance or pay a “penalty”—requires reading §5000A as punishing unlawful conduct, even if that interpretation would ren-der the law unconstitutional.  We have rejected a similar argument before.  In New York v. United States we examined a statute providing that “ ‘[e]ach State shall be responsible for providing . . . for the disposal of . . . low-level radioactive waste.’ ”  505 U. S., at 169 (quoting 42 U. S. C. §2021c(a)(1)(A)).  A State that shipped its waste to another State was exposed to surcharges by the receiving State, a portion of which would be paid over to the Federal Government.   And a State that did not adhere to the statutory scheme faced “[p]enalties for failure to comply,” including increases in the surcharge.  §2021e(e)(2); New York, 505 U. S., at 152–153.  New York urged us to read the statute as a federal command that the state legislature enact legislation to dispose of its waste, which would have violated the Constitution.  To avoid that outcome, we interpreted the statute to impose only “a series of incentives” for the State to take responsibility for its waste.  We then sustained the charge paid to the Federal Government as an exercise of the taxing power.  Id., at 169–174.  We see no insurmountable obstacle to a similar approach here.10\nThe joint dissenters argue that we cannot uphold §5000A as a tax because Congress did not “frame” it as such.  Post, at 17.  In effect, they contend that even if the Constitution permits Congress to do exactly what we interpret this statute to do, the law must be struck down because Congress used the wrong labels.  An example may help illustrate why labels should not control here.  Suppose Congress enacted a statute providing that every taxpayer who owns a house without energy efficient windows must pay $50 to the IRS.  The amount due is adjusted based on factors such as taxable income and joint filing status, and is paid along with the taxpayer’s income tax return.  Those whose income is below the filing threshold need not pay.  The required payment is not called a “tax,” a “penalty,” or anything else.  No one would doubt that this law imposed a tax, and was within Congress’s power to tax.  That conclusion should not change simply because Congress used the word “penalty” to describe the pay-ment.  Interpreting such a law to be a tax would hardly “[i]mpos[e] a tax through judicial legislation.”  Post, at 25.  Rather, it would give practical effect to the Legislature’s enactment.\nOur precedent demonstrates that Congress had the power to impose the exaction in §5000A under the taxing power, and that §5000A need not be read to do more than impose a tax.  That is sufficient to sustain it.  The “question of the constitutionality of action taken by Congress does not depend on recitals of the power which it undertakes to exercise.”  Woods v. Cloyd W. Miller Co., 333 U. S.  138, 144 (1948).\nEven if the taxing power enables Congress to impose a tax on not obtaining health insurance, any tax must still comply with other requirements in the Constitution.  Plaintiffs argue that the shared responsibility payment does not do so, citing Article I, §9, clause 4.  That clause provides: “No Capitation, or other direct, Tax shall be laid, unless in Proportion to the Census or Enumeration herein before directed to be taken.”  This requirement means that any “direct Tax” must be apportioned so that each State pays in proportion to its population.  According to the plaintiffs, if the individual mandate imposes a tax, it is a direct tax, and it is unconstitutional because Congress made no effort to apportion it among the States.\nEven when the Direct Tax Clause was written it was unclear what else, other than a capitation (also known as a “head tax” or a “poll tax”), might be a direct tax.  See Springer v. United States, 102 U. S. 586, 596–598 (1881).  Soon after the framing, Congress passed a tax on ownership of carriages, over James Madison’s objection that it was an unapportioned direct tax.  Id., at 597.  This Court upheld the tax, in part reasoning that apportioning such a tax would make little sense, because it would have required taxing carriage owners at dramatically different rates depending on how many carriages were in their home State.  See Hylton v. United States, 3 Dall. 171, 174 (1796) (opinion of Chase, J.).  The Court was unanimous, and those Justices who wrote opinions either directly asserted or strongly suggested that only two forms of taxation were direct: capitations and land taxes.  See id., at 175; id., at 177 (opinion of Paterson, J.); id., at 183 (opinion of Iredell, J.).\nThat narrow view of what a direct tax might be per-sisted for a century.  In 1880, for example, we explained that “direct taxes, within the meaning of the Constitution, are only capitation taxes, as expressed in that instrument,  and taxes on real estate.”  Springer, supra, at 602.  In 1895, we expanded our interpretation to include taxes on personal property and income from personal property, in the course of striking down aspects of the federal income tax.  Pollock v. Farmers’ Loan & Trust Co., 158 U. S. 601, 618 (1895).  That result was overturned by the Sixteenth Amendment, although we continued to consider taxes on personal property to be direct taxes.  See Eisner v. Macom-ber, 252 U. S. 189, 218–219 (1920).\nA tax on going without health insurance does not fall within any recognized category of direct tax.  It is not a capitation.  Capitations are taxes paid by every person, “without regard to property, profession, or any other circumstance.”  Hylton, supra, at 175 (opinion of Chase, J.) (emphasis altered).  The whole point of the shared responsibility payment is that it is triggered by specific cir-cumstances—earning a certain amount of income but not obtaining health insurance.  The payment is also plainly not a tax on the ownership of land or personal property.  The shared responsibility payment is thus not a direct tax that must be apportioned among the several States.\nThere may, however, be a more fundamental objection to a tax on those who lack health insurance.  Even if only a tax, the payment under §5000A(b) remains a burden that the Federal Government imposes for an omission, not an act.  If it is troubling to interpret the Commerce Clause as authorizing Congress to regulate those who abstain from commerce, perhaps it should be similarly troubling to permit Congress to impose a tax for not doing something.\nThree considerations allay this concern.  First, and most importantly, it is abundantly clear the Constitution does not guarantee that individuals may avoid taxation through inactivity.  A capitation, after all, is a tax that every- one must pay simply for existing, and capitations are expressly contemplated by the Constitution.  The Court today holds that our Constitution protects us from federal  regulation under the Commerce Clause so long as we ab-stain from the regulated activity.  But from its creation, the Constitution has made no such promise with respect to taxes.  See Letter from Benjamin Franklin to M. Le Roy (Nov. 13, 1789) (“Our new Constitution is now established . . . but in this world nothing can be said to be certain, except death and taxes”).\nWhether the mandate can be upheld under the Commerce Clause is a question about the scope of federal authority.  Its answer depends on whether Congress can exercise what all acknowledge to be the novel course of directing individuals to purchase insurance.  Congress’s use of the Taxing Clause to encourage buying something is, by contrast, not new.  Tax incentives already promote, for example, purchasing homes and professional educations.  See 26 U. S. C. §§163(h), 25A.  Sustaining the mandate as a tax depends only on whether Congress has properly exercised its taxing power to encourage purchasing health insurance, not whether it can.  Upholding the individual mandate under the Taxing Clause thus does not recognize any new federal power.  It determines that Congress has used an existing one.\nSecond, Congress’s ability to use its taxing power to influence conduct is not without limits.  A few of our cases policed these limits aggressively, invalidating punitive exactions obviously designed to regulate behavior otherwise regarded at the time as beyond federal authority.  See, e.g., United States v. Butler, 297 U. S. 1 (1936); Drexel Furniture, 259 U. S. 20.  More often and more recently we have declined to closely examine the regulatory motive or effect of revenue-raising measures.  See Kahriger, 345 U. S., at 27–31 (collecting cases).  We have nonetheless maintained that “ ‘there comes a time in the extension of the penalizing features of the so-called tax when it loses its character as such and becomes a mere penalty with the characteristics of regulation and punishment.’ ”  Kurth Ranch, 511 U. S., at 779 (quoting Drexel Furniture, supra, at 38).\nWe have already explained that the shared responsibility payment’s practical characteristics pass muster as a tax under our narrowest interpretations of the taxing power.  Supra, at 35–36.  Because the tax at hand is within even those strict limits, we need not here decide the precise point at which an exaction becomes so punitive that the taxing power does not authorize it.  It remains true, however, that the “ ‘power to tax is not the power to destroy while this Court sits.’ ”  Oklahoma Tax Comm’n v. Texas Co., 336 U. S. 342, 364 (1949) (quoting Panhandle Oil Co. v. Mississippi ex rel. Knox, 277 U. S. 218, 223 (1928) (Holmes, J., dissenting)).\nThird, although the breadth of Congress’s power to tax is greater than its power to regulate commerce, the taxing power does not give Congress the same degree of control over individual behavior.  Once we recognize that Congress may regulate a particular decision under the Commerce Clause, the Federal Government can bring its full weight to bear.  Congress may simply command individ-uals to do as it directs.  An individual who disobeys may be subjected to criminal sanctions.  Those sanctions can include not only fines and imprisonment, but all the attendant consequences of being branded a criminal: deprivation of otherwise protected civil rights, such as the right to bear arms or vote in elections; loss of employment opportunities; social stigma; and severe disabilities in other controversies, such as custody or immigration disputes.\nBy contrast, Congress’s authority under the taxing power is limited to requiring an individual to pay money into the Federal Treasury, no more.  If a tax is properly paid, the Government has no power to compel or punish individuals subject to it.  We do not make light of the se-vere burden that taxation—especially taxation motivated by a regulatory purpose—can impose.  But imposition   of a tax nonetheless leaves an individual with a lawful choice to do or not do a certain act, so long as he is willing to pay a tax levied on that choice.11\nThe Affordable Care Act’s requirement that certain in-dividuals pay a financial penalty for not obtaining health insurance may reasonably be characterized as a tax.  Be-cause the Constitution permits such a tax, it is not our role to forbid it, or to pass upon its wisdom or fairness.\nJustice Ginsburg questions the necessity of rejecting the Government’s commerce power argument, given that §5000A can be upheld under the taxing power.  Post, at 37. But the statute reads more naturally as a command to buy insurance than as a tax, and I would uphold it as a command if the Constitution allowed it.  It is only because the Commerce Clause does not authorize such a command that it is necessary to reach the taxing power question.  And it is only because we have a duty to construe a stat-ute to save it, if fairly possible, that §5000A can be interpreted as a tax.  Without deciding the Commerce Clause question, I would find no basis to adopt such a saving construction.\nThe Federal Government does not have the power to order people to buy health insurance.  Section 5000A would therefore be unconstitutional if read as a command.  The Federal Government does have the power to impose a tax on those without health insurance.  Section 5000A is  therefore constitutional, because it can reasonably be read as a tax.\nThe States also contend that the Medicaid expansion exceeds Congress’s authority under the Spending Clause.  They claim that Congress is coercing the States to adopt the changes it wants by threatening to withhold all of a State’s Medicaid grants, unless the State accepts the new expanded funding and complies with the conditions that come with it.  This, they argue, violates the basic principle that the “Federal Government may not compel the States to enact or administer a federal regulatory program.”  New York, 505 U. S., at 188.\nThere is no doubt that the Act dramatically increases state obligations under Medicaid.  The current Medicaid program requires States to cover only certain discrete categories of needy individuals—pregnant women, children, needy families, the blind, the elderly, and the dis-abled.  42 U. S. C. §1396a(a)(10).  There is no mandatory coverage for most childless adults, and the States typically do not offer any such coverage.  The States also enjoy considerable flexibility with respect to the coverage levels for parents of needy families.  §1396a(a)(10)(A)(ii).  On average States cover only those unemployed parents who make less than 37 percent of the federal poverty level, and only those employed parents who make less than 63 percent of the poverty line.  Kaiser Comm’n on Medicaid and the Uninsured, Performing Under Pressure 11, and fig. 11 (2012).\nThe Medicaid provisions of the Affordable Care Act, in contrast, require States to expand their Medicaid programs by 2014 to cover all individuals under the age of 65 with incomes below 133 percent of the federal poverty line.  §1396a(a)(10)(A)(i)(VIII).  The Act also establishes a new  “[e]ssential health benefits” package, which States must provide to all new Medicaid recipients—a level sufficient to satisfy a recipient’s obligations under the individual man-date.  §§1396a(k)(1), 1396u–7(b)(5), 18022(b).  The Af-fordable Care Act provides that the Federal Government will pay 100 percent of the costs of covering these newly eligible individuals through 2016.  §1396d(y)(1).  In the following years, the federal payment level gradually decreases, to a minimum of 90 percent.  Ibid.  In light of the expansion in coverage mandated by the Act, the Federal Government estimates that its Medicaid spending will in-crease by approximately $100 billion per year, nearly 40 percent above current levels.  Statement of Douglas W. Elmendorf, CBO’s Analysis of the Major Health Care Legislation Enacted in March 2010, p. 14, Table 2 (Mar. 30, 2011).\nThe Spending Clause grants Congress the power “to pay the Debts and provide for the . . . general Welfare of the United States.”  U. S. Const., Art. I, §8, cl. 1.  We have long recognized that Congress may use this power to grant federal funds to the States, and may condition such a grant upon the States’ “taking certain actions that Congress could not require them to take.”  College Savings Bank, 527 U. S., at 686.  Such measures “encourage a State to regulate in a particular way, [and] influenc[e] a State’s policy choices.”  New York, supra, at 166.  The con-ditions imposed by Congress ensure that the funds are used by the States to “provide for the . . . general Welfare” in the manner Congress intended.\nAt the same time, our cases have recognized limits on Congress’s power under the Spending Clause to secure state compliance with federal objectives.  “We have repeatedly characterized . . . Spending Clause legislation as ‘much in the nature of a contract.’ ”  Barnes v. Gorman, 536 U. S. 181, 186 (2002) (quoting Pennhurst State School and Hospital v. Halderman, 451 U. S. 1, 17 (1981)).  The  legitimacy of Congress’s exercise of the spending power “thus rests on whether the State voluntarily and knowingly accepts the terms of the ‘contract.’ ”  Pennhurst, supra, at 17.  Respecting this limitation is critical to ensuring that Spending Clause legislation does not undermine the status of the States as independent sovereigns in our fed-eral system.  That system “rests on what might at first seem a counterintuitive insight, that ‘freedom is enhanced by the creation of two governments, not one.’ ”  Bond, 564 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 8) (quoting Alden v. Maine, 527 U. S. 706, 758 (1999)).  For this reason, “the Constitution has never been understood to confer upon Congress the ability to require the States to govern according to Congress’ instructions.”  New York, supra, at 162.  Otherwise the two-government system established by the Framers would give way to a system that vests power in one central government, and individual liberty would suffer.\nThat insight has led this Court to strike down fed- eral legislation that commandeers a State’s legislative or administrative apparatus for federal purposes.  See, e.g., Printz, 521 U. S., at 933 (striking down federal legisla- tion compelling state law enforcement officers to perform federally mandated background checks on handgun purchasers); New York, supra, at 174–175 (invalidating provisions of an Act that would compel a State to either take title to nuclear waste or enact particular state waste regulations).  It has also led us to scrutinize Spending Clause legislation to ensure that Congress is not using financial inducements to exert a “power akin to undue influence.”  Steward Machine Co. v. Davis, 301 U. S. 548, 590 (1937).  Congress may use its spending power to create incentives for States to act in accordance with federal policies.  But when “pressure turns into compulsion,” ibid., the legislation runs contrary to our system of federalism.  “[T]he Constitution simply does not give Congress the authority to require the States to regulate.”  New York,  505 U. S., at 178.  That is true whether Congress directly commands a State to regulate or indirectly coerces a State to adopt a federal regulatory system as its own.\nPermitting the Federal Government to force the States to implement a federal program would threaten the political accountability key to our federal system.  “[W]here the Federal Government directs the States to regulate, it may be state officials who will bear the brunt of public disapproval, while the federal officials who devised the regu-latory program may remain insulated from the electoral ramifications of their decision.”  Id., at 169.  Spending Clause programs do not pose this danger when a State has a legitimate choice whether to accept the federal conditions in exchange for federal funds.  In such a situation, state officials can fairly be held politically accountable for choosing to accept or refuse the federal offer.  But when the State has no choice, the Federal Government can achieve its objectives without accountability, just as in New York and Printz.  Indeed, this danger is heightened when Congress acts under the Spending Clause, because Congress can use that power to implement federal policy it could not impose directly under its enumerated powers.\nWe addressed such concerns in Steward Machine.  That case involved a federal tax on employers that was abated if the businesses paid into a state unemployment plan that met certain federally specified conditions.  An employer sued, alleging that the tax was impermissibly “driv[ing] the state legislatures under the whip of economic pressure into the enactment of unemployment compensation laws at the bidding of the central government.”  301 U. S., at 587.  We acknowledged the danger that the Federal Government might employ its taxing power to exert a “power akin to undue influence” upon the States.  Id., at 590.  But we observed that Congress adopted the challenged tax and abatement program to channel money to the States that would otherwise have gone into the Federal Treasury for  use in providing national unemployment services.  Congress was willing to direct businesses to instead pay the money into state programs only on the condition that the money be used for the same purposes.  Predicating tax abatement on a State’s adoption of a particular type of un-employment legislation was therefore a means to “safeguard [the Federal Government’s] own treasury.”  Id., at 591.  We held that “[i]n such circumstances, if in no others, inducement or persuasion does not go beyond the bounds of power.”  Ibid.\nIn rejecting the argument that the federal law was a “weapon[ ] of coercion, destroying or impairing the autonomy of the states,” the Court noted that there was no reason to suppose that the State in that case acted other than through “her unfettered will.”  Id., at 586, 590.  Indeed, the State itself did “not offer a suggestion that in passing the unemployment law she was affected by duress.”  Id., at 589.\nAs our decision in Steward Machine confirms, Congress may attach appropriate conditions to federal taxing and spending programs to preserve its control over the use of federal funds.  In the typical case we look to the States to defend their prerogatives by adopting “the simple expedient of not yielding” to federal blandishments when they do not want to embrace the federal policies as their own.  Massachusetts v. Mellon, 262 U. S. 447, 482 (1923).  The States are separate and independent sovereigns.  Sometimes they have to act like it.\nThe States, however, argue that the Medicaid expansion is far from the typical case.  They object that Congress has “crossed the line distinguishing encouragement from coercion,” New York, supra, at 175, in the way it has structured the funding: Instead of simply refusing to grant the new funds to States that will not accept the new conditions, Congress has also threatened to withhold those States’ existing Medicaid funds.  The States claim that  this threat serves no purpose other than to force unwilling States to sign up for the dramatic expansion in health care coverage effected by the Act.\nGiven the nature of the threat and the programs at issue here, we must agree.  We have upheld Congress’s authority to condition the receipt of funds on the States’ complying with restrictions on the use of those funds, because that is the means by which Congress ensures that the funds are spent according to its view of the “general Welfare.”  Conditions that do not here govern the use of the funds, however, cannot be justified on that ba- sis.  When, for example, such conditions take the form of threats to terminate other significant independent grants, the conditions are properly viewed as a means of pressuring the States to accept policy changes.\nIn South Dakota v. Dole, we considered a challenge to a federal law that threatened to withhold five percent of a State’s federal highway funds if the State did not raise its drinking age to 21.  The Court found that the condition was “directly related to one of the main purposes for which highway funds are expended—safe interstate travel.”  483 U. S., at 208.  At the same time, the condition was not a restriction on how the highway funds—set aside for specific highway improvement and maintenance efforts—were to be used.\nWe accordingly asked whether “the financial inducement offered by Congress” was “so coercive as to pass the point at which ‘pressure turns into compulsion.’ ”  Id., at 211 (quoting Steward Machine, supra, at 590).  By “financial inducement” the Court meant the threat of losing five percent of highway funds; no new money was offered to the States to raise their drinking ages.  We found that the inducement was not impermissibly coercive, because Congress was offering only “relatively mild encouragement to the States.”  Dole, 483 U. S., at 211. We observed that “all South Dakota would lose if she adheres to her chosen  course as to a suitable minimum drinking age is 5%” of her highway funds.  Ibid.  In fact, the federal funds at stake constituted less than half of one percent of South Dakota’s budget at the time.  See Nat. Assn. of State Budget Officers, The State Expenditure Report 59 (1987); South Dakota v. Dole, 791 F. 2d 628, 630 (CA8 1986).  In consequence, “we conclude[d] that [the] encouragement to state action [was] a valid use of the spending power.”  Dole, 483 U. S., at 212.  Whether to accept the drinking age change “remain[ed] the prerogative of the States not merely in theory but in fact.”  Id., at 211–212.\nIn this case, the financial “inducement” Congress has chosen is much more than “relatively mild encouragement”—it is a gun to the head.  Section 1396c of the Medicaid Act provides that if a State’s Medicaid plan does not comply with the Act’s requirements, the Secretary of Health and Human Services may declare that “further payments will not be made to the State.”  42 U. S. C. §1396c.  A State that opts out of the Affordable Care Act’s expansion in health care coverage thus stands to lose not merely “a relatively small percentage” of its existing Medicaid funding, but all of it.  Dole, supra, at 211.  Medicaid spending accounts for over 20 percent of the average State’s total budget, with federal funds covering 50 to 83 percent of those costs.  See Nat. Assn. of State Budget Officers, Fiscal Year 2010 State Expenditure Report, p. 11, Table 5 (2011); 42 U. S. C. §1396d(b).  The Federal Government estimates that it will pay out approximately $3.3 trillion between 2010 and 2019 in order to cover the costs of pre-expansion Medicaid.  Brief for United States 10, n. 6.  In addition, the States have developed intricate statutory and administrative regimes over the course of many decades to implement their objectives under existing Medicaid.  It is easy to see how the Dole Court could conclude that the threatened loss of less than half of one percent of South Dakota’s budget left that State with a  “prerogative” to reject Congress’s desired policy, “not merely in theory but in fact.”  483 U. S., at 211–212.  The threatened loss of over 10 percent of a State’s overall budget, in contrast, is economic dragooning that leaves the States with no real option but to acquiesce in the Medicaid expansion.12\nJustice Ginsburg claims that Dole is distinguishable because here “Congress has not threatened to withhold funds earmarked for any other program.”  Post, at 47.  But that begs the question: The States contend that the expansion is in reality a new program and that Congress is forcing them to accept it by threatening the funds for the existing Medicaid program.  We cannot agree that existing Medicaid and the expansion dictated by the Affordable Care Act are all one program simply because “Congress styled” them as such.  Post, at 49.  If the expansion is not properly viewed as a modification of the existing Medicaid program, Congress’s decision to so title it is irrelevant.13\nHere, the Government claims that the Medicaid expansion is properly viewed merely as a modification of the ex-isting program because the States agreed that Congress could change the terms of Medicaid when they signed on in the first place.  The Government observes that the Social Security Act, which includes the original Medicaid provisions, contains a clause expressly reserving “[t]he right to alter, amend, or repeal any provision” of that statute.  42 U. S. C. §1304.  So it does.  But “if Congress intends to impose a condition on the grant of federal moneys, it must do so unambiguously.”  Pennhurst, 451 U. S., at 17.  A State confronted with statutory language reserving the right to “alter” or “amend” the pertinent provisions of the Social Security Act might reasonably assume that Congress was entitled to make adjustments to the Medicaid program as it developed.  Congress has in fact done so, sometimes conditioning only the new funding, other times both old and new.  See, e.g., Social Security Amendments of 1972, 86 Stat. 1381–1382, 1465 (extending Med-icaid eligibility, but partly conditioning only the new funding); Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990, §4601, 104 Stat. 1388–166 (extending eligibility, and conditioning old and new funds).\nThe Medicaid expansion, however, accomplishes a shift in kind, not merely degree.  The original program was de-signed to cover medical services for four particular cat-egories of the needy: the disabled, the blind, the elderly, and needy families with dependent children.  See 42 U. S. C. §1396a(a)(10).  Previous amendments to Medicaid eligibility merely altered and expanded the boundaries of these categories.  Under the Affordable Care Act, Medicaid is transformed into a program to meet the health care needs of the entire nonelderly population with income below 133 percent of the poverty level.  It is no longer a program to care for the neediest among us, but rather an element of a comprehensive national plan to provide uni versal health insurance coverage.14\nIndeed, the manner in which the expansion is structured indicates that while Congress may have styled the expansion a mere alteration of existing Medicaid, it recognized it was enlisting the States in a new health care program.   Congress created a separate funding provision to cover the costs of providing services to any person made newly eligible by the expansion.  While Congress pays 50 to 83 percent of the costs of covering individuals currently enrolled in Medicaid, §1396d(b), once the expansion is fully implemented Congress will pay 90 percent of the costs for newly eligible persons, §1396d(y)(1).  The conditions on use of the different funds are also distinct.  Congress mandated that newly eligible persons receive a level of coverage that is less comprehensive than the traditional Medicaid benefit package.  §1396a(k)(1); see Brief for United States 9.\nAs we have explained, “[t]hough Congress’ power to legislate under the spending power is broad, it does not include surprising participating States with postacceptance or ‘retroactive’ conditions.”  Pennhurst, supra, at 25.  A State could hardly anticipate that Congress’s reservation of the right to “alter” or “amend” the Medicaid program included the power to transform it so dramatically.\nJustice Ginsburg claims that in fact this expansion is  no different from the previous changes to Medicaid, such that “a State would be hard put to complain that it lacked fair notice.”  Post, at 56.  But the prior change she dis-cusses—presumably the most dramatic alteration she could find—does not come close to working the transformation the expansion accomplishes.  She highlights an amendment requiring States to cover pregnant women and increasing the number of eligible children.  Ibid.  But this modification can hardly be described as a major change in a program that—from its inception—provided health care for “families with dependent children.”  Previous Medicaid amendments simply do not fall into the same category as the one at stake here.\nThe Court in Steward Machine did not attempt to “fix the outermost line” where persuasion gives way to coercion.  301 U. S., at 591.  The Court found it “[e]nough for present purposes that wherever the line may be, this statute is within it.”  Ibid.  We have no need to fix a line either.  It is enough for today that wherever that line may be, this statute is surely beyond it.  Congress may not simply “conscript state [agencies] into the national bureaucratic army,” FERC v. Mississippi, 456 U. S. 742, 775 (1982) (O’Connor, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part), and that is what it is attempting to do with the Medicaid expansion.\nNothing in our opinion precludes Congress from offering funds under the Affordable Care Act to expand the availability of health care, and requiring that States accepting such funds comply with the conditions on their use.  What Congress is not free to do is to penalize States that choose not to participate in that new program by taking away their existing Medicaid funding.  Section 1396c gives the Secretary of Health and Human Services the authority to  do just that.  It allows her to withhold all “further [Medicaid] payments . . . to the State” if she determines that the State is out of compliance with any Medicaid requirement, including those contained in the expansion.  42 U. S. C. §1396c.  In light of the Court’s holding, the Secretary cannot apply §1396c to withdraw existing Medicaid funds for failure to comply with the requirements set out in the expansion.\nThat fully remedies the constitutional violation we have identified.  The chapter of the United States Code that contains §1396c includes a severability clause confirming that we need go no further.  That clause specifies that “[i]f any provision of this chapter, or the application thereof to any person or circumstance, is held invalid, the remainder of the chapter, and the application of such provision to other persons or circumstances shall not be affected thereby.”  §1303.  Today’s holding does not affect the continued ap-plication of §1396c to the existing Medicaid program.  Nor does it affect the Secretary’s ability to withdraw funds pro-vided under the Affordable Care Act if a State that has chosen to participate in the expansion fails to comply with the requirements of that Act.\nThis is not to say, as the joint dissent suggests, that we are “rewriting the Medicaid Expansion.”  Post, at 48.  Instead, we determine, first, that §1396c is unconstitutional when applied to withdraw existing Medicaid funds from States that decline to comply with the expansion.  We then follow Congress’s explicit textual instruction to leave unaffected “the remainder of the chapter, and the application of [the challenged] provision to other persons or circumstances.”  §1303.  When we invalidate an application of a statute because that application is unconstitutional, we are not “rewriting” the statute; we are merely enforcing the Constitution.\nThe question remains whether today’s holding affects other provisions of the Affordable Care Act.  In considering  that question, “[w]e seek to determine what Congress would have intended in light of the Court’s constitutional holding.”  United States v. Booker, 543 U. S. 220, 246 (2005) (internal quotation marks omitted).  Our “touchstone for any decision about remedy is legislative intent, for a court cannot use its remedial powers to circum- vent the intent of the legislature.”  Ayotte v. Planned Parenthood of Northern New Eng., 546 U. S. 320, 330 (2006) (internal quotation marks omitted).  The question here is whether Congress would have wanted the rest of the Act to stand, had it known that States would have a genuine choice whether to participate in the new Medicaid expansion.  Unless it is “evident” that the answer is no, we must leave the rest of the Act intact.  Champlin Refining Co. v. Corporation Comm’n of Okla., 286 U. S. 210, 234 (1932).\nWe are confident that Congress would have wanted to preserve the rest of the Act.  It is fair to say that Congress assumed that every State would participate in the Medicaid expansion, given that States had no real choice but to do so.  The States contend that Congress enacted the rest of the Act with such full participation in mind; they point out that Congress made Medicaid a means for satisfying the mandate, 26 U. S. C. §5000A(f)(1)(A)(ii), and enacted no other plan for providing coverage to many low-income individuals.  According to the States, this means that the entire Act must fall.\nWe disagree.  The Court today limits the financial pressure the Secretary may apply to induce States to accept the terms of the Medicaid expansion.  As a practical matter, that means States may now choose to reject the expansion; that is the whole point.  But that does not mean all or even any will.  Some States may indeed decline to participate, either because they are unsure they will be able to afford their share of the new funding obligations, or because they are unwilling to commit the administra tive resources necessary to support the expansion.  Other States, however, may voluntarily sign up, finding the idea of expanding Medicaid coverage attractive, particularly given the level of federal funding the Act offers at the outset.\nWe have no way of knowing how many States will accept the terms of the expansion, but we do not believe Congress would have wanted the whole Act to fall, simply because some may choose not to participate.  The other reforms Congress enacted, after all, will remain “fully operative as a law,” Champlin, supra, at 234, and will still function in a way “consistent with Congress’ basic objectives in enacting the statute,” Booker, supra, at 259.  Confident that Congress would not have intended anything different, we conclude that the rest of the Act need not fall in light of our constitutional holding.\nThe Affordable Care Act is constitutional in part and unconstitutional in part.  The individual mandate cannot be upheld as an exercise of Congress’s power under the Commerce Clause.  That Clause authorizes Congress to regulate interstate commerce, not to order individuals to engage in it.  In this case, however, it is reasonable to con-strue what Congress has done as increasing taxes on those who have a certain amount of income, but choose to go without health insurance.  Such legislation is within Con-gress’s power to tax.\nAs for the Medicaid expansion, that portion of the Affordable Care Act violates the Constitution by threatening existing Medicaid funding.  Congress has no authority to order the States to regulate according to its instructions.  Congress may offer the States grants and require the States to comply with accompanying conditions, but the States must have a genuine choice whether to accept the offer.  The States are given no such choice in this case:  They must either accept a basic change in the nature of Medicaid, or risk losing all Medicaid funding.  The remedy for that constitutional violation is to preclude the Federal Government from imposing such a sanction.  That remedy does not require striking down other portions of the Affordable Care Act.\nThe Framers created a Federal Government of limited powers, and assigned to this Court the duty of enforcing those limits.  The Court does so today.  But the Court does not express any opinion on the wisdom of the Affordable Care Act.  Under the Constitution, that judgment is reserved to the people.\nThe judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit is affirmed in part and reversed in part.\nIt is so ordered.\n1  The Eleventh Circuit did not consider whether the Anti-Injunction Act bars challenges to the individual mandate.  The District Court had determined that it did not, and neither side challenged that holding on appeal.  The same was true in the Fourth Circuit, but that court examined the question sua sponte because it viewed the Anti-Injunction Act as a limit on its subject matter jurisdiction.  See Liberty Univ., 671 F. 3d, at 400–401.  The Sixth Circuit and the D. C. Circuit considered the question but determined that the Anti-Injunction Act did not apply.  See Thomas More, 651 F. 3d, at 539–540 (CA6); Seven-Sky, 661 F. 3d, at 5–14 (CADC).\n2  We appointed H. Bartow Farr III to brief and argue in support of the Eleventh Circuit’s judgment with respect to severability, and Robert A. Long to brief and argue the proposition that the Anti-Injunction Act bars the current challenges to the individual mandate.  565 U. S. ___ (2011).  Both amici have ably discharged their assigned responsibilities.\n3  The examples of other congressional mandates cited by Justice Ginsburg, post, at 35, n. 10 (opinion concurring in part, concurring in judgment in part, and dissenting in part), are not to the contrary.  Each of those mandates—to report for jury duty, to register for the draft, to purchase firearms in anticipation of militia service, to exchange gold currency for paper currency, and to file a tax return—are based on constitutional provisions other than the Commerce Clause.  See Art. I, §8, cl. 9 (to “constitute Tribunals inferior to the supreme Court”); id., cl. 12 (to “raise and support Armies”); id., cl. 16 (to “provide for organizing, arming, and disciplining, the Militia”); id., cl. 5 (to “coin Money”); id., cl. 1 (to “lay and collect Taxes”).\n4  Justice Ginsburg suggests that “at the time the Constitution was framed, to ‘regulate’ meant, among other things, to require action.”  Post, at 23 (citing Seven-Sky v. Holder, 661 F. 3d 1, 16 (CADC 2011); brackets and some internal quotation marks omitted).  But to reach this conclusion, the case cited by Justice Ginsburg relied on a dictionary in which “[t]o order; to command” was the fifth-alternative definition of “to direct,” which was itself the second-alternative definition of “to regulate.”  See Seven-Sky, supra, at 16 (citing S. Johnson, Dictionary of the English Language (4th ed. 1773) (reprinted 1978)).  It is unlikely that the Framers had such an obscure meaning in mind when they used the word “regulate.”  Far more commonly, “[t]o regulate” meant “[t]o adjust by rule or method,” which presupposes something to adjust.  2 Johnson, supra, at 1619; see also Gibbons, 9 Wheat., at 196 (defining the commerce power as the power “to prescribe the rule by which commerce is to be governed”).\n5  Justice Ginsburg cites two eminent domain cases from the 1890s to support the proposition that our case law does not “toe the activity versus inactivity line.”  Post, at 24–25 (citing Monongahela Nav. Co. v. United States, 148 U. S. 312, 335–337 (1893), and Cherokee Nation v. Southern Kansas R. Co., 135 U. S. 641, 657–659 (1890)).  The fact that the Fifth Amendment requires the payment of just compensation  when the Government exercises its power of eminent domain does not turn the taking into a commercial transaction between the landowner and the Government, let alone a government-compelled transaction between the landowner and a third party.\n6  In an attempt to recast the individual mandate as a regulation of commercial activity, Justice Ginsburg suggests that “[a]n individual who opts not to purchase insurance from a private insurer can be seen as actively selecting another form of insurance: self-insurance.”  Post, at 26.  But “self-insurance” is, in this context, nothing more than a description of the failure to purchase insurance.  Individuals are no more “activ[e] in the self-insurance market” when they fail to purchase insurance, ibid., than they are active in the “rest” market when doing nothing.\n7  Sotelo, in particular, would seem to refute the joint dissent’s contention that we have “never” treated an exaction as a tax if it was denominated a penalty.  Post, at 20.  We are not persuaded by the dissent’s attempt to distinguish Sotelo as a statutory construction case from the bankruptcy context.  Post, at 17, n. 5.  The dissent itself treats the question here as one of statutory interpretation, and indeed also relies on a statutory interpretation case from the bankruptcy context.  Post, at 23 (citing United States v. Reorganized CF&I Fabricators of Utah, Inc., 518 U. S. 213, 224 (1996)).\n8  In 2016, for example, individuals making $35,000 a year are expected to owe the IRS about $60 for any month in which they do not have health insurance.  Someone with an annual income of $100,000 a year would likely owe about $200.  The price of a qualifying insurance policy is projected to be around $400 per month.  See D. Newman, CRS Report for Congress, Individual Mandate and Related Information Re-quirements Under PPACA 7, and n. 25 (2011).\n9  We do not suggest that any exaction lacking a scienter requirement and enforced by the IRS is within the taxing power.  See post, at 23–24 (joint opinion of Scalia, Kennedy, Thomas, and Alito, JJ., dissenting).  Congress could not, for example, expand its authority to impose criminal fines by creating strict liability offenses enforced by the IRS rather than the FBI.  But the fact the exaction here is paid like a tax, to the agency that collects taxes—rather than, for example, exacted by Department of Labor inspectors after ferreting out willful malfeasance—suggests that this exaction may be viewed as a tax.\n10  The joint dissent attempts to distinguish New York v. United States on the ground that the seemingly imperative language in that case was in an “introductory provision” that had “no legal consequences.”  Post, at 19.  We did not rely on that reasoning in New York.  See 505 U. S., at 169–170.  Nor could we have.  While the Court quoted only the broad statement that “[e]ach State shall be responsible” for its waste, that language was implemented through operative provisions that also use the words on which the dissent relies.  See 42 U. S. C. §2021e(e)(1) (entitled “Requirements for non-sited compact regions and non-member States” and directing that those entities “shall comply with the following requirements”); §2021e(e)(2) (describing “Penalties for failure to comply”).  The Court upheld those provisions not as lawful commands, but as “incentives.”  See 505 U. S., at 152–153, 171–173.\n11  Of course, individuals do not have a lawful choice not to pay a tax due, and may sometimes face prosecution for failing to do so (although not for declining to make the shared responsibility payment, see 26 U. S. C. §5000A(g)(2)).  But that does not show that the tax restricts the lawful choice whether to undertake or forgo the activity on which the tax is predicated.  Those subject to the individual mandate may lawfully forgo health insurance and pay higher taxes, or buy health insurance and pay lower taxes.  The only thing they may not lawfully do is not buy health insurance and not pay the resulting tax.\n12  Justice Ginsburg observes that state Medicaid spending will increase by only 0.8 percent after the expansion.  Post, at 43. That not only ignores increased state administrative expenses, but also assumes that the Federal Government will continue to fund the expansion at the current statutorily specified levels.  It is not unheard of, however, for the Federal Government to increase requirements in such a manner as to impose unfunded mandates on the States.  More importantly, the size of the new financial burden imposed on a State is irrelevant in analyzing whether the State has been coerced into accepting that burden.  “Your money or your life” is a coercive proposition, whether you have a single dollar in your pocket or $500.\n13  Nor, of course, can the number of pages the amendment occu- pies, or the extent to which the change preserves and works within the existing program, be dispositive.  Cf. post, at 49–50 (opinion of Ginsburg, J.).  Take, for example, the following hypothetical amendment: “All of a State’s citizens are now eligible for Medicaid.”  That change would take up a single line and would not alter any “operational aspect[ ] of the program” beyond the eligibility requirements.  Post, at 49.  Yet it could hardly be argued that such an amendment was a permissible modification of Medicaid, rather than an attempt to foist an entirely new health care system upon the States.\n14  Justice Ginsburg suggests that the States can have no objection to the Medicaid expansion, because “Congress could have repealed Medicaid [and,] [t]hereafter, . . . could have enacted Medicaid II, a new program combining the pre-2010 coverage with the expanded coverage required by the ACA.”  Post, at 51; see also post, at 38.  But it would certainly not be that easy.  Practical constraints would plainly inhibit, if not preclude, the Federal Government from repealing the existing program and putting every feature of Medicaid on the table for political reconsideration.  Such a massive undertaking would hardly be “ritualistic.”  Ibid.  The same is true of Justice Ginsburg’s suggestion that Congress could establish Medicaid as an exclusively federal program.  Post, at 44.\nSUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES\n_________________\nNos. 11–393, 11–398 and 11–400\n_________________\nNATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT BUSINESS, et al., PETITIONERS\n11–393 v.\nKATHLEEN SEBELIUS, SECRETARY OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, et al.\nDEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, et al., PETITIONERS\n11–398 v.\nFLORIDA et al.\nFLORIDA, et al., PETITIONERS\n11–400 v.\nDEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES et al.\nJustice Ginsburg, with whom Justice Sotomayor joins, and with whom Justice Breyer and Justice Kagan join as to Parts I, II, III, and IV, concurring in part, concurring in the judgment in part, and dissenting in part.\nI agree with The Chief Justice that the Anti-Injunction Act does not bar the Court’s consideration of this case, and that the minimum coverage provision is a proper exercise of Congress’ taxing power.  I therefore join Parts I, II, and III–C of The Chief Justice’s opinion. Unlike The Chief Justice, however, I would hold, alterna tively, that the Commerce Clause authorizes Congress to enact the minimum coverage provision.  I would also hold that the Spending Clause permits the Medicaid expansion exactly as Congress enacted it.\nThe provision of health care is today a concern of national dimension, just as the provision of old-age and survivors’ benefits was in the 1930’s.  In the Social Secu- rity Act, Congress installed a federal system to provide monthly benefits to retired wage earners and, eventually, to their survivors.  Beyond question, Congress could have adopted a similar scheme for health care.  Congress chose, instead, to preserve a central role for private insurers and state governments.  According to The Chief Justice, the Commerce Clause does not permit that preservation.  This rigid reading of the Clause makes scant sense and is stunningly retrogressive.\nSince 1937, our precedent has recognized Congress’ large authority to set the Nation’s course in the economic and social welfare realm.  See United States v. Darby, 312 U. S. 100, 115 (1941) (overruling Hammer v. Dagenhart, 247 U. S. 251 (1918), and recognizing that “regulations of commerce which do not infringe some constitutional prohibi- tion are within the plenary power conferred on Congress by the Commerce Clause”); NLRB v. Jones & Laughlin Steel Corp., 301 U. S. 1, 37 (1937) (“[The commerce] power is plenary and may be exerted to protect interstate commerce no matter what the source of the dangers which threaten it.” (internal quotation marks omitted)).  The Chief Justice’s crabbed reading of the Commerce Clause harks back to the era in which the Court routinely thwarted Congress’ efforts to regulate the national economy in the interest of those who labor to sustain it.  See, e.g., Railroad Retirement Bd. v. Alton R. Co., 295 U. S. 330, 362, 368 (1935) (invalidating compulsory retirement and  pension plan for employees of carriers subject to the Interstate Commerce Act; Court found law related essentially “to the social welfare of the worker, and therefore remote from any regulation of commerce as such”).  It is a reading that should not have staying power.\nIn enacting the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA), Congress comprehensively reformed the national market for health-care products and services. By any measure, that market is immense.  Collectively, Americans spent $2.5 trillion on health care in 2009, accounting for 17.6% of our Nation’s economy.  42 U. S. C. §18091(2)(B) (2006 ed., Supp. IV).  Within the next decade, it is anticipated, spending on health care will nearly double.  Ibid.\nThe health-care market’s size is not its only distinctive feature.  Unlike the market for almost any other product or service, the market for medical care is one in which all individuals inevitably participate.  Virtually every person residing in the United States, sooner or later, will visit a doctor or other health-care professional.  See Dept. of Health and Human Services, National Center for Health Statistics, Summary Health Statistics for U. S. Adults: National Health Interview Survey 2009, Ser. 10, No. 249, p. 124, Table 37 (Dec. 2010) (Over 99.5% of adults above 65 have visited a health-care professional.).  Most people will do so repeatedly.  See id., at 115, Table 34 (In 2009 alone, 64% of adults made two or more visits to a doctor’s office.).\nWhen individuals make those visits, they face another reality of the current market for medical care: its high cost.  In 2010, on average, an individual in the United States incurred over $7,000 in health-care expenses.  Dept. of Health and Human Services, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, Historic National Health  Expenditure Data, National Health Expenditures: Se- lected Calendar Years 1960–2010 (Table 1).  Over a lifetime, costs mount to hundreds of thousands of dollars.  See Alemayahu & Warner, The Lifetime Distribution of Health Care Costs, in 39 Health Service Research 627, 635 (June 2004).  When a person requires nonroutine care, the cost will generally exceed what he or she can afford to pay.  A single hospital stay, for instance, typically costs upwards of $10,000.  See Dept. of Health and Human Services, Office of Health Policy, ASPE Research Brief: The Value of Health Insurance 5 (May 2011).  Treatments for many serious, though not uncommon, conditions similarly cost a substantial sum.  Brief for Economic Scholars as Amici Curiae in No. 11–398, p. 10 (citing a study indicating that, in 1998, the cost of treating a heart attack for the first 90 days exceeded $20,000, while the annual cost of treating certain cancers was more than $50,000).\nAlthough every U. S. domiciliary will incur significant medical expenses during his or her lifetime, the time when care will be needed is often unpredictable.  An accident, a heart attack, or a cancer diagnosis commonly occurs without warning.  Inescapably, we are all at peril of needing medical care without a moment’s notice.  See, e.g., Campbell, Down the Insurance Rabbit Hole, N. Y. Times, Apr. 5, 2012, p. A23 (telling of an uninsured 32-year-old woman who, healthy one day, became a quadriplegic the next due to an auto accident).\nTo manage the risks associated with medical care— its high cost, its unpredictability, and its inevitability—most people in the United States obtain health insurance.  Many (approximately 170 million in 2009) are insured by private insurance companies.  Others, including those over 65 and certain poor and disabled persons, rely on government-funded insurance programs, notably Medicare and Medicaid.  Combined, private health insurers and State and Federal Governments finance almost 85% of the  medical care administered to U. S. residents.  See Congressional Budget Office, CBO’s 2011 Long-Term Budget Outlook 37 (June 2011).\nNot all U. S. residents, however, have health insurance.  In 2009, approximately 50 million people were uninsured, either by choice or, more likely, because they could not afford private insurance and did not qualify for government aid.  See Dept. of Commerce, Census Bureau, C. DeNavas-Walt, B. Proctor, & J. Smith, Income, Poverty, and Health Insurance Coverage in the United States: 2009, p. 23, Table 8 (Sept. 2010).  As a group, uninsured individuals annually consume more than $100 billion in health- care services, nearly 5% of the Nation’s total.  Hidden Health Tax: Americans Pay a Premium 2 (2009), avail- able at http://www.familiesusa.org (all Internet mate- rial as visited June 25, 2012, and included in Clerk of Court’s case file).  Over 60% of those without insurance visit a doctor’s office or emergency room in a given year. See Dept. of Health and Human Services, National Cen- ter for Health Statistics, Health—United States—2010, p. 282, Table 79 (Feb. 2011).\nThe large number of individuals without health insurance, Congress found, heavily burdens the national health-care market.  See 42 U. S. C. §18091(2).  As just noted, the cost of emergency care or treatment for a serious illness generally exceeds what an individual can afford to pay on her own.  Unlike markets for most products, however, the inability to pay for care does not mean that an uninsured individual will receive no care.  Federal and state law, as well as professional obligations and embedded social norms, require hospitals and physicians to provide care when it is most needed, regardless of the patient’s ability to pay.  See, e.g., 42 U. S. C. §1395dd; Fla. Stat. §395.1041(3)(f) (2010); Tex. Health & Safety Code  Ann. §§311.022(a) and (b) (West 2010); American Medical Association, Council on Ethical and Judicial Affairs, Code of Medical Ethics, Current Opinions: Opinion 8.11—Neglect of Patient, p. 70 (1998–1999 ed.).\nAs a consequence, medical-care providers deliver sig- nificant amounts of care to the uninsured for which the providers receive no payment.  In 2008, for example, hospi- tals, physicians, and other health-care professionals received no compensation for $43 billion worth of the $116 billion in care they administered to those without insurance.  42 U. S. C. §18091(2)(F) (2006 ed., Supp. IV).\nHealth-care providers do not absorb these bad debts. Instead, they raise their prices, passing along the cost of uncompensated care to those who do pay reliably: the government and private insurance companies.  In response, private insurers increase their premiums, shifting the cost of the elevated bills from providers onto those who carry insurance.  The net result: Those with health insurance subsidize the medical care of those without it.  As economists would describe what happens, the uninsured “free ride” on those who pay for health insurance.\nThe size of this subsidy is considerable.  Congress found that the cost-shifting just described “increases family [insurance] premiums by on average over $1,000 a year.”  Ibid.  Higher premiums, in turn, render health insurance less affordable, forcing more people to go without insurance and leading to further cost-shifting.\nAnd it is hardly just the currently sick or injured among the uninsured who prompt elevation of the price of health care and health insurance.  Insurance companies and health-care providers know that some percentage of healthy, uninsured people will suffer sickness or injury each year and will receive medical care despite their inability to pay.  In anticipation of this uncompensated care, health-care companies raise their prices, and insurers their premiums.  In other words, because any uninsured  person may need medical care at any moment and because health-care companies must account for that risk, every uninsured person impacts the market price of medical care and medical insurance.\nThe failure of individuals to acquire insurance has other deleterious effects on the health-care market.  Because those without insurance generally lack access to preventative care, they do not receive treatment for conditions—like hypertension and diabetes—that can be successfully and affordably treated if diagnosed early on.  See Institute of Medicine, National Academies, Insuring America’s Health: Principles and Recommendations 43 (2004).  When sickness finally drives the uninsured to seek care, once treatable conditions have escalated into grave health problems, requiring more costly and extensive intervention.  Id., at 43–44.  The extra time and resources providers spend serving the uninsured lessens the providers’ ability to care for those who do have insurance.  See Kliff, High Uninsured Rates Can Kill You—Even if You Have Coverage, Washington Post (May 7, 2012) (describing a study of California’s health-care market which found that, when hospitals divert time and resources to provide uncompensated care, the quality of care the hospitals deliver to those with insurance drops significantly), availa- ble at http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/post/ high-uninsured-rates-can-kill-you-even-if-you-have-coverage/2012/ 05/07/gIQALNHN8T_print.html.\nStates cannot resolve the problem of the uninsured on their own.  Like Social Security benefits, a universal health-care system, if adopted by an individual State, would be “bait to the needy and dependent elsewhere, encouraging them to migrate and seek a haven of repose.”  Helvering v. Davis, 301 U. S. 619, 644 (1937).  See also Brief for Commonwealth of Massachusetts as Amicus Curiae in No. 11–398, p. 15 (noting that, in 2009, Massachusetts’ emergency rooms served thousands of uninsured, out-of-state residents).  An influx of unhealthy individuals into a State with universal health care would result in increased spending on medical services.  To cover the increased costs, a State would have to raise taxes, and private health-insurance companies would have to increase premiums.  Higher taxes and increased insurance costs would, in turn, encourage businesses and healthy individuals to leave the State.\nStates that undertake health-care reforms on their own thus risk “placing themselves in a position of economic disadvantage as compared with neighbors or competitors.”  Davis, 301 U. S., at 644.  See also Brief for Health Care for All, Inc., et al. as Amici Curiae in No. 11–398, p. 4 (“[O]ut-of-state residents continue to seek and receive millions of dollars in uncompensated care in Massachusetts hospitals, limiting the State’s efforts to improve its health care system through the elimination of uncompensated care.”).  Facing that risk, individual States are unlikely to take the initiative in addressing the problem of the uninsured, even though solving that problem is in all States’ best interests.  Congress’ intervention was needed to overcome this collective- action impasse.\nAware that a national solution was required, Congress could have taken over the health-insurance market by establishing a tax-and-spend federal program like Social Security.  Such a program, commonly referred to as a single-payer system (where the sole payer is the Federal Government), would have left little, if any, room for private enterprise or the States.  Instead of going this route, Congress enacted the ACA, a solution that retains a robust role for private insurers and state governments.  To make its chosen approach work, however, Congress had to  use some new tools, including a requirement that most individuals obtain private health insurance coverage.  See 26 U. S. C. §5000A (2006 ed., Supp. IV) (the minimum coverage provision).  As explained below, by employing these tools, Congress was able to achieve a practical, alto- gether reasonable, solution.\nA central aim of the ACA is to reduce the number of uninsured U. S. residents.  See 42 U. S. C. §18091(2)(C) and (I) (2006 ed., Supp. IV).  The minimum coverage provision advances this objective by giving potential recipients of health care a financial incentive to acquire insurance.  Per the minimum coverage provision, an individual must either obtain insurance or pay a toll constructed as a tax penalty.  See 26 U. S. C. §5000A.\nThe minimum coverage provision serves a further purpose vital to Congress’ plan to reduce the number of uninsured.  Congress knew that encouraging individuals to purchase insurance would not suffice to solve the problem, because most of the uninsured are not uninsured by choice.1  Of particular concern to Congress were people who, though desperately in need of insurance, often cannot acquire it: persons who suffer from preexisting medical conditions.\nBefore the ACA’s enactment, private insurance companies took an applicant’s medical history into account when setting insurance rates or deciding whether to insure an individual.  Because individuals with preexisting med-  ical conditions cost insurance companies significantly more than those without such conditions, insurers routinely re- fused to insure these individuals, charged them substantially higher premiums, or offered only limited coverage that did not include the preexisting illness.  See Dept. of Health and Human Services, Coverage Denied: How the Current Health Insurance System Leaves Millions Behind 1 (2009) (Over the past three years, 12.6 million non- elderly adults were denied insurance coverage or charged higher premiums due to a preexisting condition.).\nTo ensure that individuals with medical histories have access to affordable insurance, Congress devised a three-part solution.  First, Congress imposed a “guaranteed is- sue” requirement, which bars insurers from denying coverage to any person on account of that person’s medical condition or history.  See 42 U. S. C. §§300gg–1, 300gg–3, 300gg–4(a) (2006 ed., Supp. IV).  Second, Congress required insurers to use “community rating” to price their insurance policies.  See §300gg.  Community rating, in effect, bars insurance companies from charging higher premiums to those with preexisting conditions.\nBut these two provisions, Congress comprehended, could not work effectively unless individuals were given a powerful incentive to obtain insurance.  See Hearings before the House Ways and Means Committee, 111th Cong., 1st Sess., 10, 13 (2009) (statement of Uwe Reinhardt) (“[I]m- position of community-rated premiums and guaranteed issue on a market of competing private health insurers will inexorably drive that market into extinction, unless these two features are coupled with . . . a mandate on individual[s] to be insured.” (emphasis in original)).\nIn the 1990’s, several States—including New York, New Jersey, Washington, Kentucky, Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont—enacted guaranteed-issue and community-rating laws without requiring universal acquisition of insurance coverage.  The results were disastrous.  “All  seven states suffered from skyrocketing insurance pre- mium costs, reductions in individuals with coverage, and reductions in insurance products and providers.”  Brief for American Association of People with Disabilities et al. as Amici Curiae in No. 11–398, p. 9 (hereinafter AAPD Brief).  See also Brief for Governor of Washington Christine Gregoire as Amicus Curiae in No. 11–398, pp. 11–14 (describing the “death spiral” in the insurance market Washington experienced when the State passed a law requiring coverage for preexisting conditions).\nCongress comprehended that guaranteed-issue and community-rating laws alone will not work.  When insurance companies are required to insure the sick at affordable prices, individuals can wait until they become ill to buy insurance.  Pretty soon, those in need of immediate medical care—i.e., those who cost insurers the most—become the insurance companies’ main customers.  This “adverse selection” problem leaves insurers with two choices: They can either raise premiums dramatically to cover their ever-increasing costs or they can exit the market.  In the seven States that tried guaranteed-issue and community-rating requirements without a minimum coverage provision, that is precisely what insurance companies did.  See, e.g., AAPD Brief 10 (“[In Maine,] [m]any insurance providers doubled their premiums in just three years or less.”); id., at 12 (“Like New York, Vermont saw substantial increases in premiums after its . . . insurance reform measures took effect in 1993.”); Hall, An Evaluation of New York’s Reform Law, 25 J. Health Pol. Pol’y & L. 71, 91–92 (2000) (Guaranteed-issue and community-rating laws resulted in a “dramatic exodus of indemnity insurers from New York’s individual [insurance] market.”); Brief for Barry Friedman et al. as Amici Curiae in No. 11–398, p. 17 (“In Kentucky, all but two insurers (one State-run) abandoned the State.”).\nMassachusetts, Congress was told, cracked the adverse  selection problem.  By requiring most residents to obtain insurance, see Mass. Gen. Laws, ch. 111M, §2 (West 2011), the Commonwealth ensured that insurers would not be left with only the sick as customers.  As a result, federal lawmakers observed, Massachusetts succeeded where other States had failed.  See Brief for Commonwealth of Massachusetts as Amicus Curiae in No. 11–398, p. 3 (noting that the Commonwealth’s reforms reduced the number of uninsured residents to less than 2%, the lowest rate in the Nation, and cut the amount of uncompensated care by a third); 42 U. S. C. §18091(2)(D) (2006 ed., Supp. IV) (noting the success of Massachusetts’ reforms).2  In coupling the minimum coverage provision with guaranteed-issue and community-rating prescriptions, Congress followed Massachusetts’ lead.\nIn sum, Congress passed the minimum coverage provision as a key component of the ACA to address an economic and social problem that has plagued the Nation for decades: the large number of U. S. residents who are unable or unwilling to obtain health insurance.  Whatever one thinks of the policy decision Congress made, it was Congress’ prerogative to make it.  Reviewed with appropriate deference, the minimum coverage provision, allied to the guaranteed-issue and community-rating prescriptions, should survive measurement under the Commerce and Necessary and Proper Clauses.\nThe Commerce Clause, it is widely acknowledged, “was the Framers’ response to the central problem that gave  rise to the Constitution itself.”  EEOC v. Wyoming, 460 U. S. 226, 244, 245, n. 1 (1983) (Stevens, J., concurring) (citing sources).  Under the Articles of Confederation, the Constitution’s precursor, the regulation of commerce was left to the States.  This scheme proved unworkable, because the individual States, understandably focused on their own economic interests, often failed to take actions critical to the success of the Nation as a whole.  See Vices of the Political System of the United States, in James Madison: Writings 69, 71, ¶5 (J. Rakove ed. 1999) (As a result of the “want of concert in matters where common interest requires it,” the “national dignity, interest, and reve- nue [have] suffered.”).3\nWhat was needed was a “national Government . . . armed with a positive & compleat authority in all cases where uniform measures are necessary.”  See Letter from James Madison to Edmund Randolph (Apr. 8, 1787), in 9 Papers of James Madison 368, 370 (R. Rutland ed. 1975).  See also Letter from George Washington to James Madison (Nov. 30, 1785), in 8 id., at 428, 429 (“We are either a United people, or we are not.  If the former, let us, in all matters of general concern act as a nation, which ha[s] national objects to promote, and a national character to support.”).  The Framers’ solution was the Commerce Clause, which, as they perceived it, granted Congress the authority to enact economic legislation “in all Cases for the general Interests of the Union, and also in those Cases to which the States are separately incompetent.”  2 Records of the Federal Convention of 1787, pp. 131–132, ¶8  (M. Farrand rev. 1966).  See also North American Co. v. SEC, 327 U. S. 686, 705 (1946) (“[The commerce power] is an affirmative power commensurate with the national needs.”).\nThe Framers understood that the “general Interests of the Union” would change over time, in ways they could not anticipate.  Accordingly, they recognized that the Constitution was of necessity a “great outlin[e],” not a detailed blueprint, see McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 407 (1819), and that its provisions included broad concepts, to be “explained by the context or by the facts of the case,” Letter from James Madison to N. P. Trist (Dec. 1831), in 9 Writings of James Madison 471, 475 (G. Hunt ed. 1910).  “Nothing . . . can be more fallacious,” Alexander Hamilton emphasized, “than to infer the extent of any power, proper to be lodged in the national government, from . . . its immediate necessities.  There ought to be a capacity to provide for future contingencies[,] as they may happen; and as these are illimitable in their nature, it is impossible safely to limit that capacity.”  The Federalist No. 34, pp. 205, 206 (John Harvard Library ed. 2009).  See also McCulloch, 4 Wheat., at 415 (The Necessary and Proper Clause is lodged “in a constitution[,] intended to endure for ages to come, and consequently, to be adapted to the various crises of human affairs.”).\nConsistent with the Framers’ intent, we have repeatedly emphasized that Congress’ authority under the Commerce Clause is dependent upon “practical” considerations, including “actual experience.”  Jones & Laughlin Steel Corp., 301 U. S., at 41–42; see Wickard v. Filburn, 317 U. S. 111, 122 (1942); United States v. Lopez, 514 U. S. 549, 573 (1995) (Kennedy, J., concurring) (emphasizing “the Court’s definitive commitment to the practical conception of the commerce power”).  See also North American Co., 327 U. S., at 705 (“Commerce itself is an intensely practical matter.  To deal with it effectively, Congress must be able to act in terms of economic and financial realities.” (citation omitted)).  We afford Congress the leeway “to undertake to solve national problems directly and realistically.”  American Power & Light Co. v. SEC, 329 U. S. 90, 103 (1946).\nUntil today, this Court’s pragmatic approach to judging whether Congress validly exercised its commerce power was guided by two familiar principles.  First, Congress has the power to regulate economic activities “that substantially affect interstate commerce.”  Gonzales v. Raich, 545 U. S. 1, 17 (2005).  This capacious power extends even to local activities that, viewed in the aggregate, have a substantial impact on interstate commerce.  See ibid.  See also Wickard, 317 U. S., at 125 (“[E]ven if appellee’s activ- ity be local and though it may not be regarded as commerce, it may still, whatever its nature, be reached by Congress if it exerts a substantial economic effect on interstate commerce.” (emphasis added)); Jones & Laughlin Steel Corp., 301 U. S., at 37.\nSecond, we owe a large measure of respect to Congress when it frames and enacts economic and social legislation.  See Raich, 545 U. S., at 17.  See also Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation v. R. A. Gray & Co., 467 U. S. 717, 729 (1984) (“[S]trong deference [is] accorded legislation in the field of national economic policy.”); Hodel v. Indiana, 452 U. S. 314, 326 (1981) (“This [C]ourt will certainly not substitute its judgment for that of Congress unless the relation of the subject to interstate commerce and its ef- fect upon it are clearly non-existent.” (internal quotation marks omitted)).  When appraising such legislation, we ask only (1) whether Congress had a “rational basis” for concluding that the regulated activity substantially affects interstate commerce, and (2) whether there is a “reasonable connection between the regulatory means selected and  the asserted ends.”  Id., at 323–324.  See also Raich, 545 U. S., at 22; Lopez, 514 U. S., at 557; Hodel v. Virginia Surface Mining & Reclamation Assn., Inc., 452 U. S. 264, 277 (1981); Katzenbach v. McClung, 379 U. S. 294, 303 (1964); Heart of Atlanta Motel, Inc. v. United States, 379 U. S. 241, 258 (1964); United States v. Carolene Products Co., 304 U. S. 144, 152–153 (1938).  In answering these questions, we presume the statute under review is constitutional and may strike it down only on a “plain showing” that Congress acted irrationally.  United States v. Morrison, 529 U. S. 598, 607 (2000).\nStraightforward application of these principles would require the Court to hold that the minimum coverage provision is proper Commerce Clause legislation.  Beyond dispute, Congress had a rational basis for concluding that the uninsured, as a class, substantially affect interstate commerce.  Those without insurance consume billions of dollars of health-care products and services each year.  See supra, at 5.  Those goods are produced, sold, and delivered largely by national and regional companies who routinely transact business across state lines.  The uninsured also cross state lines to receive care.  Some have medical emergencies while away from home.  Others, when sick, go to a neighboring State that provides better care for those who have not prepaid for care.  See supra, at 7–8.\nNot only do those without insurance consume a large amount of health care each year; critically, as earlier explained, their inability to pay for a significant portion of that consumption drives up market prices, foists costs on other consumers, and reduces market efficiency and stability.  See supra, at 5–7.  Given these far-reaching effects on interstate commerce, the decision to forgo insurance is hardly inconsequential or equivalent to “doing nothing,” ante, at 20; it is, instead, an economic decision Congress  has the authority to address under the Commerce Clause.  See supra, at 14–16.  See also Wickard, 317 U. S., at 128 (“It is well established by decisions of this Court that the power to regulate commerce includes the power to regulate the prices at which commodities in that commerce are dealt in and practices affecting such prices.” (emphasis added)).\nThe minimum coverage provision, furthermore, bears a “reasonable connection” to Congress’ goal of protecting the health-care market from the disruption caused by individuals who fail to obtain insurance.  By requiring those who do not carry insurance to pay a toll, the minimum coverage provision gives individuals a strong incentive to insure.  This incentive, Congress had good reason to believe, would reduce the number of uninsured and, correspondingly, mitigate the adverse impact the uninsured have on the national health-care market.\nCongress also acted reasonably in requiring uninsured individuals, whether sick or healthy, either to obtain insurance or to pay the specified penalty.  As earlier observed, because every person is at risk of needing care at any moment, all those who lack insurance, regardless of their current health status, adversely affect the price of health care and health insurance.  See supra, at 6–7.  Moreover, an insurance-purchase requirement limited to those in need of immediate care simply could not work.  Insurance companies would either charge these individuals prohibitively expensive premiums, or, if community-rating regulations were in place, close up shop.  See supra, at 9–11.  See also Brief for State of Maryland and 10 Other States et al. as Amici Curiae in No. 11–398, p. 28 (hereinafter Maryland Brief) (“No insurance regime can survive if people can opt out when the risk insured against is only a risk, but opt in when the risk materializes.”).\n“[W]here we find that the legislators . . . have a rational basis for finding a chosen regulatory scheme necessary to  the protection of commerce, our investigation is at an end.”  Katzenbach, 379 U. S., at 303–304.  Congress’ enactment of the minimum coverage provision, which addresses a specific interstate problem in a practical, experience-informed manner, easily meets this criterion.\nRather than evaluating the constitutionality of the minimum coverage provision in the manner established by our precedents, The Chief Justice relies on a newly minted constitutional doctrine.  The commerce power does not, The Chief Justice announces, permit Congress to “compe[l] individuals to become active in commerce by purchasing a product.”  Ante, at 20 (emphasis deleted).\nThe Chief Justice’s novel constraint on Congress’ commerce power gains no force from our precedent and for that reason alone warrants disapprobation.  See infra, at 23–27.  But even assuming, for the moment, that Congress lacks authority under the Commerce Clause to “compel individuals not engaged in commerce to purchase an unwanted product,” ante, at 18, such a limitation would be inapplicable here.  Everyone will, at some point, consume health-care products and services.  See supra, at 3.  Thus, if The Chief Justice is correct that an insurance-purchase requirement can be applied only to those who “actively” consume health care, the minimum coverage provision fits the bill.\nThe Chief Justice does not dispute that all U. S. residents participate in the market for health services over the course of their lives.  See ante, at 16 (“Everyone will eventually need health care at a time and to an extent they cannot predict.”).  But, The Chief Justice insists, the uninsured cannot be considered active in the market  for health care, because “[t]he proximity and degree of connection between the [uninsured today] and [their] subsequent commercial activity is too lacking.”  Ante,at 27.\nThis argument has multiple flaws.  First, more than 60% of those without insurance visit a hospital or doctor’s office each year.  See supra, at 5.  Nearly 90% will within five years.4  An uninsured’s consumption of health care is thus quite proximate: It is virtually certain to occur in the next five years and more likely than not to occur this year.\nEqually evident, Congress has no way of separating those uninsured individuals who will need emergency medi- cal care today (surely their consumption of medical care is sufficiently imminent) from those who will not need medical services for years to come.  No one knows when an emergency will occur, yet emergencies involving the uninsured arise daily.  To capture individuals who unexpect- edly will obtain medical care in the very near future, then, Congress needed to include individuals who will not go to a doctor anytime soon.  Congress, our decisions instruct, has authority to cast its net that wide.  See Perez v. United States, 402 U. S. 146, 154 (1971) (“[W]hen it is necessary in order to prevent an evil to make the law embrace more than the precise thing to be prevented it may do so.” (internal quotation marks omitted)).5\nSecond, it is Congress’ role, not the Court’s, to delineate the boundaries of the market the Legislature seeks to regulate.  The Chief Justice defines the health-care mar- ket as including only those transactions that will occur either in the next instant or within some (unspecified) proximity to the next instant.  But Congress could reasonably have viewed the market from a long-term perspective, encompassing all transactions virtually certain to occur over the next decade, see supra, at 19, not just those occurring here and now.\nThird, contrary to The Chief Justice’s contention, our precedent does indeed support “[t]he proposition that Congress may dictate the conduct of an individual today because of prophesied future activity.”  Ante, at 26.  In Wickard, the Court upheld a penalty the Federal Government imposed on a farmer who grew more wheat than he was permitted to grow under the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938 (AAA).  317 U. S., at 114–115.  He could not be penalized, the farmer argued, as he was growing the wheat for home consumption, not for sale on the open market.  Id., at 119.  The Court rejected this argument.  Id., at 127–129. Wheat intended for home consumption, the Court noted, “overhangs the market, and if induced by rising prices, tends to flow into the market and check price increases [intended by the AAA].”  Id., at 128.\nSimilar reasoning supported the Court’s judgment in Raich, which upheld Congress’ authority to regulate marijuana grown for personal use.  545 U. S., at 19.  Homegrown marijuana substantially affects the interstate mar- ket for marijuana, we observed, for “the high demand in the interstate market will [likely] draw such marijuana into that market.”  Ibid.\nOur decisions thus acknowledge Congress’ authority, under the Commerce Clause, to direct the conduct of an individual today (the farmer in Wickard, stopped from growing excess wheat; the plaintiff in Raich, ordered to  cease cultivating marijuana) because of a prophesied future transaction (the eventual sale of that wheat or marijuana in the interstate market).  Congress’ actions are even more rational in this case, where the future activity (the consumption of medical care) is certain to occur, the sole uncertainty being the time the activity will take place.\nMaintaining that the uninsured are not active in the health-care market, The Chief Justice draws an analogy to the car market.  An individual “is not ‘active in the car market,’ ” The Chief Justice observes, simply because he or she may someday buy a car.  Ante, at 25.  The analogy is inapt.  The inevitable yet unpredictable need for medical care and the guarantee that emergency care will be provided when required are conditions nonexistent in other markets.  That is so of the market for cars, and of the market for broccoli as well.  Although an individual might buy a car or a crown of broccoli one day, there is no certainty she will ever do so.  And if she eventually wants a car or has a craving for broccoli, she will be obliged to pay at the counter before receiving the vehicle or nourishment.  She will get no free ride or food, at the expense of another consumer forced to pay an inflated price.  See Thomas More Law Center v. Obama, 651 F. 3d 529, 565 (CA6 2011) (Sutton, J., concurring in part) (“Regulating how citizens pay for what they already receive (health care), never quite know when they will need, and in the case of severe illnesses or emergencies generally will not be able to afford, has few (if any) parallels in modern life.”).  Upholding the minimum coverage provision on the ground that all are participants or will be participants in the health-care market would therefore carry no implication that Congress may justify under the Commerce Clause a mandate to buy other products and services.\nNor is it accurate to say that the minimum coverage provision “compel[s] individuals . . . to purchase an un wanted product,” ante, at 18, or “suite of products,” post, at 11, n. 2 (joint opinion of Scalia, Kennedy, Thomas, and Alito, JJ.).  If unwanted today, medical service secured by insurance may be desperately needed tomorrow.  Virtually everyone, I reiterate, consumes health care at some point in his or her life.  See supra, at 3.  Health insurance is a means of paying for this care, nothing more.  In requiring individuals to obtain insurance, Congress is therefore not mandating the purchase of a discrete, unwanted product.  Rather, Congress is merely defining the terms on which individuals pay for an interstate good they consume: Persons subject to the mandate must now pay for medical care in advance (instead of at the point of service) and through insurance (instead of out of pocket).  Establishing payment terms for goods in or affecting interstate commerce is quintessential economic regulation well within Congress’ domain.  See, e.g., United States v. Wrightwood Dairy Co., 315 U. S. 110, 118 (1942).  Cf. post, at 13 (joint opinion of Scalia, Kennedy, Thomas, and Alito, JJ.) (recognizing that “the Federal Government can prescribe [a commodity’s] quality . . . and even [its price]”).\nThe Chief Justice also calls the minimum coverage provision an illegitimate effort to make young, healthy individuals subsidize insurance premiums paid by the less hale and hardy.  See ante, at 17, 25–26.  This complaint, too, is spurious.  Under the current health-care system, healthy persons who lack insurance receive a benefit for which they do not pay: They are assured that, if they need it, emergency medical care will be available, although they cannot afford it.  See supra, at 5–6.  Those who have insurance bear the cost of this guarantee.  See ibid.  By requiring the healthy uninsured to obtain insurance or pay a penalty structured as a tax, the minimum coverage provision ends the free ride these individuals currently enjoy.\nIn the fullness of time, moreover, today’s young and  healthy will become society’s old and infirm.  Viewed over a lifespan, the costs and benefits even out: The young who pay more than their fair share currently will pay less than their fair share when they become senior citizens.  And even if, as undoubtedly will be the case, some individuals, over their lifespans, will pay more for health insurance than they receive in health services, they have little to complain about, for that is how insurance works.  Every insured person receives protection against a catastrophic loss, even though only a subset of the covered class will ultimately need that protection.\nIn any event, The Chief Justice’s limitation of the commerce power to the regulation of those actively engaged in commerce finds no home in the text of the Constitution or our decisions.  Article I, §8, of the Constitution grants Congress the power “[t]o regulate Commerce . . . among the several States.”  Nothing in this language im- plies that Congress’ commerce power is limited to regu- lating those actively engaged in commercial transactions.  Indeed, as the D. C. Circuit observed, “[a]t the time the Constitution was [framed], to ‘regulate’ meant,” among other things, “to require action.”  See Seven-Sky v. Holder, 661 F. 3d 1, 16 (2011).\nArguing to the contrary, The Chief Justice notes that “the Constitution gives Congress the power to ‘coin Money,’ in addition to the power to ‘regulate the Value thereof,’ ” and similarly “gives Congress the power to ‘raise and support Armies’ and to ‘provide and maintain a Navy,’ in addition to the power to ‘make Rules for the Government and Regulation of the land and naval Forces.’ ”  Ante, at 18–19 (citing Art. I, §8, cls. 5, 12–14).  In separating the power to regulate from the power to bring the subject of the regulation into existence, The Chief Justice asserts, “[t]he language of the Constitution reflects the natural  understanding that the power to regulate assumes there is already something to be regulated.”  Ante, at 19.\nThis argument is difficult to fathom.  Requiring individuals to obtain insurance unquestionably regulates the inter- state health-insurance and health-care markets, both of them in existence well before the enactment of the ACA.  See Wickard, 317 U. S., at 128 (“The stimulation of commerce is a use of the regulatory function quite as definitely as prohibitions or restrictions thereon.”).  Thus, the “something to be regulated” was surely there when Congress created the minimum coverage provision.6\nNor does our case law toe the activity versus inactiv- ity line.  In Wickard, for example, we upheld the penalty imposed on a farmer who grew too much wheat, even though the regulation had the effect of compelling farmers to purchase wheat in the open market.  Id., at 127–129.  “[F]orcing some farmers into the market to buy what they could provide for themselves” was, the Court held, a valid means of regulating commerce.  Id., at 128–129.  In an- other context, this Court similarly upheld Congress’ authority under the commerce power to compel an “inactive” land- holder to submit to an unwanted sale.  See Monongahela Nav. Co. v. United States, 148 U. S. 312, 335–337 (1893) (“[U]pon the [great] power to regulate commerce[,]” Congress has the authority to mandate the sale of real prop- erty to the Government, where the sale is essential to the improvement of a navigable waterway (emphasis added)); Cherokee Nation v. Southern Kansas R. Co., 135 U. S. 641,  657–659 (1890) (similar reliance on the commerce power regarding mandated sale of private property for railroad construction).\nIn concluding that the Commerce Clause does not permit Congress to regulate commercial “inactivity,” and there- fore does not allow Congress to adopt the practical solution it devised for the health-care problem, The Chief Justice views the Clause as a “technical legal conception,” precisely what our case law tells us not to do.  Wickard, 317 U. S., at 122 (internal quotation marks omitted).  See also supra, at 14–16.  This Court’s former endeavors to impose categorical limits on the commerce power have not fared well.  In several pre-New Deal cases, the Court attempted to cabin Congress’ Commerce Clause authority by distinguishing “commerce” from activity once conceived to be noncommercial, notably, “production,” “mining,” and “manufacturing.”  See, e.g., United States v. E. C. Knight Co., 156 U. S. 1, 12 (1895) (“Commerce succeeds to manufacture, and is not a part of it.”); Carter v. Carter Coal Co., 298 U. S. 238, 304 (1936) (“Mining brings the subject matter of commerce into existence.  Commerce disposes of it.”).  The Court also sought to distinguish activities having a “direct” effect on interstate commerce, and for that reason, subject to federal regulation, from those having only an “indirect” effect, and therefore not amenable to federal control.  See, e.g., A. L. A. Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States, 295 U. S. 495, 548 (1935) (“[T]he dis- tinction between direct and indirect effects of intrastate transactions upon interstate commerce must be recognized as a fundamental one.”).\nThese line-drawing exercises were untenable, and the Court long ago abandoned them.  “[Q]uestions of the power of Congress [under the Commerce Clause],” we held in Wickard, “are not to be decided by reference to any for- mula which would give controlling force to nomenclature such as ‘production’ and ‘indirect’ and foreclose consideration of  the actual effects of the activity in question upon interstate commerce.”  317 U. S., at 120.  See also Morrison, 529 U. S., at 641–644 (Souter, J., dissenting) (recounting the Court’s “nearly disastrous experiment” with formalistic limits on Congress’ commerce power).  Failing to learn from this history, The Chief Justice plows ahead with his formalistic distinction between those who are “active in commerce,” ante, at 20, and those who are not.\nIt is not hard to show the difficulty courts (and Congress) would encounter in distinguishing statutes that reg- ulate “activity” from those that regulate “inactivity.”  As Judge Easterbrook noted, “it is possible to restate most actions as corresponding inactions with the same effect.”  Archie v. Racine, 847 F. 2d 1211, 1213 (CA7 1988) (en banc). Take this case as an example.  An individual who opts not to purchase insurance from a private insurer can be seen as actively selecting another form of insurance: self-insurance.  See Thomas More Law Center, 651 F. 3d, at 561 (Sutton, J., concurring in part) (“No one is in- active when deciding how to pay for health care, as self-insurance and private insurance are two forms of action for addressing the same risk.”).  The minimum coverage provision could therefore be described as regulating activists in the self-insurance market.7 Wickard is another example.  Did the statute there at issue target activity (the growing of too much wheat) or inactivity (the farmer’s failure to purchase wheat in the marketplace)?  If anything, the Court’s analysis suggested the latter.  See 317 U. S., at 127–129.\nAt bottom, The Chief Justice’s and the joint dissent ers’ “view that an individual cannot be subject to Commerce Clause regulation absent voluntary, affirmative acts that enter him or her into, or affect, the interstate mar- ket expresses a concern for individual liberty that [is] more redolent of Due Process Clause arguments.”  Seven-Sky, 661 F. 3d, at 19.  See also Troxel v. Granville, 530 U. S. 57, 65 (2000) (plurality opinion) (“The [Due Process] Clause also includes a substantive component that provides heightened protection against government interference with certain fundamental rights and liberty interests.” (internal quotation marks omitted)).  Plaintiffs have abandoned any argument pinned to substantive due process, however, see 648 F. 3d 1235, 1291, n. 93 (CA11 2011), and now concede that the provisions here at issue do not offend the Due Process Clause.8\nUnderlying The Chief Justice’s view that the Commerce Clause must be confined to the regulation of active participants in a commercial market is a fear that the commerce power would otherwise know no limits.  See, e.g., ante, at 23 (Allowing Congress to compel an individ- ual not engaged in commerce to purchase a product would “permi[t] Congress to reach beyond the natural extent of its authority, everywhere extending the sphere of its activity, and drawing all power into its impetuous vortex.” (internal quotation marks omitted)).  The joint dissenters  express a similar apprehension.  See post, at 8 (If the minimum coverage provision is upheld under the commerce power then “the Commerce Clause becomes a font of unlimited power, . . . the hideous monster whose devouring jaws . . . spare neither sex nor age, nor high nor low, nor sacred nor profane.” (internal quotation marks omitted)).  This concern is unfounded.\nFirst, The Chief Justice could certainly uphold the individual mandate without giving Congress carte blanche to enact any and all purchase mandates.  As several times noted, the unique attributes of the health-care market render everyone active in that market and give rise to a significant free-riding problem that does not occur in other markets.  See supra, at 3–7, 16–18, 21.\nNor would the commerce power be unbridled, absent The Chief Justice’s “activity” limitation.  Congress would remain unable to regulate noneconomic conduct that has only an attenuated effect on interstate commerce and is traditionally left to state law.  See Lopez, 514 U. S., at 567; Morrison, 529 U. S., at 617–619.  In Lopez, for example, the Court held that the Federal Government lacked power, under the Commerce Clause, to criminalize the possession of a gun in a local school zone.  Possessing a gun near a school, the Court reasoned, “is in no sense an economic activity that might, through repetition elsewhere, substantially affect any sort of interstate commerce.”  514 U. S., at 567; ibid. (noting that the Court would have “to pile inference upon inference” to conclude that gun possession has a substantial effect on commerce).  Relying on similar logic, the Court concluded in Morrison that Congress could not regulate gender-motivated violence, which the Court deemed to have too “attenuated [an] effect upon interstate commerce.”  529 U. S., at 615.\nAn individual’s decision to self-insure, I have explained, is an economic act with the requisite connection to interstate commerce.  See supra, at 16–17.  Other choices  individuals make are unlikely to fit the same or similar description.  As an example of the type of regulation he fears, The Chief Justice cites a Government mandate to purchase green vegetables.  Ante, at 22–23.  One could call this concern “the broccoli horrible.”  Congress, The Chief Justice posits, might adopt such a mandate, reasoning that an individual’s failure to eat a healthy diet, like the failure to purchase health insurance, imposes costs on others.  See ibid.\nConsider the chain of inferences the Court would have to accept to conclude that a vegetable-purchase mandate was likely to have a substantial effect on the health-care costs borne by lithe Americans.  The Court would have to believe that individuals forced to buy vegetables would then eat them (instead of throwing or giving them away), would prepare the vegetables in a healthy way (steamed or raw, not deep-fried), would cut back on unhealthy foods, and would not allow other factors (such as lack of exercise or little sleep) to trump the improved diet.9  Such “pil[ing of] inference upon inference” is just what the Court refused to do in Lopez and Morrison.\nOther provisions of the Constitution also check congressional overreaching.  A mandate to purchase a particu- lar product would be unconstitutional if, for example, the edict impermissibly abridged the freedom of speech, interfered with the free exercise of religion, or infringed on a liberty interest protected by the Due Process Clause.\nSupplementing these legal restraints is a formidable check on congressional power: the democratic process.  See Raich, 545 U. S., at 33; Wickard, 317 U. S., at 120 (repeating Chief Justice Marshall’s “warning that effective restraints on [the commerce power’s] exercise must proceed from political rather than judicial processes” (citing Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1, 197 (1824)).  As the controversy surrounding the passage of the Affordable Care Act attests, purchase mandates are likely to engender political resistance.  This prospect is borne out by the behavior of state legislators.  Despite their possession of unquestioned authority to impose mandates, state governments have rarely done so.  See Hall, Commerce Clause Challenges to Health Care Reform, 159 U. Pa. L. Rev. 1825, 1838 (2011).\nWhen contemplated in its extreme, almost any power looks dangerous.  The commerce power, hypothetically, would enable Congress to prohibit the purchase and home production of all meat, fish, and dairy goods, effectively compelling Americans to eat only vegetables.  Cf. Raich, 545 U. S., at 9; Wickard, 317 U. S., at 127–129.  Yet no one would offer the “hypothetical and unreal possibilit[y],” Pullman Co. v. Knott, 235 U. S. 23, 26 (1914), of a vegetarian state as a credible reason to deny Congress the authority ever to ban the possession and sale of goods.  The Chief Justice accepts just such specious logic when he cites the broccoli horrible as a reason to deny Congress the power to pass the individual mandate.  Cf. R. Bork, The Tempting of America 169 (1990) (“Judges and lawyers live on the slippery slope of analogies; they are not supposed to ski it to the bottom.”).  But see, e.g., post, at 3 (joint opinion of Scalia, Kennedy, Thomas, and Alito, JJ.) (asserting, outlandishly, that if the minimum coverage provision is sustained, then Congress could make “breathing in and out the basis for federal prescription”).\nTo bolster his argument that the minimum coverage provision is not valid Commerce Clause legislation, The Chief Justice emphasizes the provision’s novelty.  See ante, at 18 (asserting that “sometimes the most telling indication of [a] severe constitutional problem . . . is the lack of historical precedent for Congress’s action” (internal quotation marks omitted)).  While an insurance-purchase mandate may be novel, The Chief Justice’s argument certainly is not.  “[I]n almost every instance of the exer- cise of the [commerce] power differences are asserted from previous exercises of it and made a ground of attack.”  Hoke v. United States, 227 U. S. 308, 320 (1913).  See, e.g., Brief for Petitioner in Perez v. United States, O. T. 1970, No. 600, p. 5 (“unprecedented exercise of power”); Sup- plemental Brief for Appellees in Katzenbach v. McClung, O. T. 1964, No. 543, p. 40 (“novel assertion of federal power”); Brief for Appellee in Wickard v. Filburn, O. T. 1941, No. 59, p. 6  (“complete departure”).  For decades, the Court has declined to override legislation because of its novelty, and for good reason.  As our national economy grows and changes, we have recognized, Congress must adapt to the changing “economic and financial realities.”  See supra, at 14–15.  Hindering Congress’ ability to do so is shortsighted; if history is any guide, today’s constriction of the Commerce Clause will not endure.  See supra, at 25–26.\nFor the reasons explained above, the minimum coverage provision is valid Commerce Clause legislation.  See supra, Part II.  When viewed as a component of the entire ACA, the provision’s constitutionality becomes even plainer.\nThe Necessary and Proper Clause “empowers Congress  to enact laws in effectuation of its [commerce] powe[r] that are not within its authority to enact in isolation.”  Raich, 545 U. S., at 39 (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment).  Hence, “[a] complex regulatory program . . . can survive a Commerce Clause challenge without a showing that every single facet of the program is independently and directly related to a valid congressional goal.”  Indiana, 452 U. S., at 329, n. 17.  “It is enough that the challenged provisions are an integral part of the regulatory program and that the regulatory scheme when considered as a whole satisfies this test.”  Ibid. (collecting cases).  See also Raich, 545 U. S., at 24–25 (A challenged statutory provision fits within Congress’ commerce authority if it is an “essential par[t] of a larger regulation of economic activity,” such that, in the absence of the provision, “the regulatory scheme could be undercut.” (quoting Lopez, 514 U. S., at 561)); Raich, 545 U. S., at 37 (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment) (“Congress may regulate even noneconomic local activity if that regulation is a necessary part of a more general regulation of interstate commerce.  The relevant question is simply whether the means chosen are ‘reasonably adapted’ to the attainment of a legitimate end under the commerce power.” (citation omitted)).\nRecall that one of Congress’ goals in enacting the Affordable Care Act was to eliminate the insurance industry’s practice of charging higher prices or denying coverage to individuals with preexisting medical conditions.  See supra, at 9–10.  The commerce power allows Congress to ban this practice, a point no one disputes.  See United States v. South-Eastern Underwriters Assn., 322 U. S. 533, 545, 552–553 (1944) (Congress may regulate “the methods by which interstate insurance companies do business.”).\nCongress knew, however, that simply barring insurance companies from relying on an applicant’s medical history would not work in practice.  Without the individual mandate, Congress learned, guaranteed-issue and community- rating requirements would trigger an adverse-selection death-spiral in the health-insurance market: Insurance premiums would skyrocket, the number of uninsured would increase, and insurance companies would exit the market.  See supra, at 10–11.  When complemented by an insurance mandate, on the other hand, guaranteed issue and community rating would work as intended, increasing access to insurance and reducing uncompensated care.  See supra, at 11–12.  The minimum coverage provision is thus an “essential par[t] of a larger regulation of economic activity”; without the provision, “the regulatory scheme [w]ould be undercut.”  Raich, 545 U. S., at 24–25 (inter- nal quotation marks omitted).  Put differently, the minimum coverage provision, together with the guaranteed-issue and community-rating requirements, is “ ‘reasonably adapted’ to the attainment of a legitimate end under the commerce power”: the elimination of pricing and sales practices that take an applicant’s medical history into account.  See id., at 37 (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment).\nAsserting that the Necessary and Proper Clause does not authorize the minimum coverage provision, The Chief Justice focuses on the word “proper.”  A mandate to purchase health insurance is not “proper” legislation, The Chief Justice urges, because the command “undermine[s] the structure of government established by the Constitution.”  Ante, at 28.  If long on rhetoric, The Chief Justice’s argument is short on substance.\nThe Chief Justice cites only two cases in which this Court concluded that a federal statute impermissibly transgressed the Constitution’s boundary between state and federal authority: Printz v. United States, 521 U. S. 898 (1997), and New York v. United States, 505 U. S. 144 (1992).  See ante, at 29.  The statutes at issue in  both cases, however, compelled state officials to act on the Federal Government’s behalf.  521 U. S., at 925–933 (holding unconstitutional a statute obligating state law enforcement officers to implement a federal gun-control law); New York, 505 U. S., at 176–177 (striking down a statute requiring state legislators to pass regulations pursuant to Congress’ instructions).  “[Federal] laws conscripting state officers,” the Court reasoned, “violate state sovereignty and are thus not in accord with the Constitution.”  Printz, 521 U. S., at 925, 935; New York, 505 U. S., at 176.\nThe minimum coverage provision, in contrast, acts “directly upon individuals, without employing the States as intermediaries.”  New York, 505 U. S., at 164.  The provision is thus entirely consistent with the Consti- tution’s design.  See Printz, 521 U. S., at 920 (“[T]he Framers explicitly chose a Constitution that confers upon Congress the power to regulate individuals, not States.” (internal quotation marks omitted)).\nLacking case law support for his holding, The Chief Justice nevertheless declares the minimum coverage provision not “proper” because it is less “narrow in scope” than other laws this Court has upheld under the Necessary and Proper Clause.  Ante, at 29 (citing United States v. Comstock, 560 U. S. ___ (2010); Sabri v. United States, 541 U. S. 600 (2004); Jinks v. Richland County, 538 U. S. 456 (2003)).  The Chief Justice’s reliance on cases in which this Court has affirmed Congress’ “broad authority to enact federal legislation” under the Necessary and Proper Clause, Comstock, 560 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 5), is underwhelming.\nNor does The Chief Justice pause to explain why the power to direct either the purchase of health insurance or, alternatively, the payment of a penalty collectible as a tax is more far-reaching than other implied powers this Court has found meet under the Necessary and Proper Clause.  These powers include the power to enact criminal laws,  see, e.g., United States v. Fox, 95 U. S. 670, 672 (1878); the power to imprison, including civil imprisonment, see, e.g., Comstock, 560 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 1); and the power to create a national bank, see McCulloch, 4 Wheat., at 425.  See also Jinks, 538 U. S., at 463 (affirming Congress’ power to alter the way a state law is applied in state court, where the alteration “promotes fair and efficient operation of the federal courts”).10\nIn failing to explain why the individual mandate threatens our constitutional order, The Chief Justice disserves future courts.  How is a judge to decide, when ruling on the constitutionality of a federal statute, whether Congress employed an “independent power,” ante, at 28, or merely a “derivative” one, ante, at 29.  Whether the power used is “substantive,” ante, at 30, or just “incidental,” ante, at 29?  The instruction The Chief Justice, in effect, provides lower courts: You will know it when you see it.\nIt is more than exaggeration to suggest that the minimum coverage provision improperly intrudes on “essential attributes of state sovereignty.”  Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted).  First, the Affordable Care Act does not operate “in [an] are[a] such as criminal law enforcement or education where States historically have been sovereign.”  Lopez, 514 U. S., at 564.  As evidenced by Medicare, Medicaid, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), the Federal Govern ment plays a lead role in the health-care sector, both as a direct payer and as a regulator.\nSecond, and perhaps most important, the minimum coverage provision, along with other provisions of the ACA, addresses the very sort of interstate problem that made the commerce power essential in our federal system.  See supra, at 12–14.  The crisis created by the large number of U. S. residents who lack health insurance is one of national dimension that States are “separately incompetent” to handle.  See supra, at 7–8, 13.  See also Maryland Brief 15–26 (describing “the impediments to effective state policymaking that flow from the interconnectedness of each state’s healthcare economy” and emphasizing that “state-level reforms cannot fully address the problems associated with uncompensated care”).  Far from trampling on States’ sovereignty, the ACA attempts a federal solution for the very reason that the States, acting separately, cannot meet the need.  Notably, the ACA serves the general welfare of the people of the United States while retaining a prominent role for the States.  See id., at 31–36 (explaining and illustrating how the ACA affords States wide latitude in implementing key elements of the Act’s reforms).11\nIn the early 20th century, this Court regularly struck down economic regulation enacted by the peoples’ representatives in both the States and the Federal Government.  See, e.g., Carter Coal Co., 298 U. S., at 303–304, 309–310; Dagenhart, 247 U. S., at 276–277; Lochner v. New York, 198 U. S. 45, 64 (1905).  The Chief Justice’s Commerce Clause opinion, and even more so the joint dissenters’ reasoning, see post, at 4–16, bear a disquieting resemblance to those long-overruled decisions.\nUltimately, the Court upholds the individual mandate as a proper exercise of Congress’ power to tax and spend “for the . . . general Welfare of the United States.”  Art. I, §8, cl. 1; ante, at 43–44.  I concur in that determination, which makes The Chief Justice’s Commerce Clause essay all the more puzzling.  Why should The Chief Justice strive so mightily to hem in Congress’ capacity to meet the new problems arising constantly in our ever-developing modern economy?  I find no satisfying response to that question in his opinion.12\nThrough Medicaid, Congress has offered the States an opportunity to furnish health care to the poor with the aid of federal financing.  To receive federal Medicaid funds, States must provide health benefits to specified categories of needy persons, including pregnant women, children, parents, and adults with disabilities.  Guaranteed eligibility varies by category: for some it is tied to the federal poverty level (incomes up to 100% or 133%); for others it depends on criteria such as eligibility for designated state or federal assistance programs.  The ACA enlarges the population of needy people States must cover to include adults under age 65 with incomes up to 133% of the fed- eral poverty level.  The spending power conferred by the Constitution, the Court has never doubted, permits Congress to define the contours of programs financed with federal funds.  See, e.g., Pennhurst State School and Hospital v. Halderman, 451 U. S. 1, 17 (1981).  And to expand coverage, Congress could have recalled the existing legislation, and replaced it with a new law making Medicaid as embracive of the poor as Congress chose.\nThe question posed by the 2010 Medicaid expansion, then, is essentially this: To cover a notably larger population, must Congress take the repeal/reenact route, or may it achieve the same result by amending existing law?  The answer should be that Congress may expand by amendment the classes of needy persons entitled to Medicaid benefits.  A ritualistic requirement that Congress repeal and reenact spending legislation in order to enlarge the population served by a federally funded program would advance no constitutional principle and would scarcely serve the interests of federalism.  To the contrary, such a requirement would rigidify Congress’ efforts to empower States by partnering with them in the implementation of federal programs.\nMedicaid is a prototypical example of federal-state coop eration in serving the Nation’s general welfare.  Rather than authorizing a federal agency to administer a uni- form national health-care system for the poor, Con- gress offered States the opportunity to tailor Medicaid grants to their particular needs, so long as they remain within bounds set by federal law.  In shaping Medicaid, Congress did not endeavor to fix permanently the terms participating states must meet; instead, Congress reserved the “right to alter, amend, or repeal” any provision of the Medicaid Act.  42 U. S. C. §1304.  States, for their part, agreed to amend their own Medicaid plans consistent with changes from time to time made in the federal law.  See 42 CFR §430.12(c)(i) (2011).  And from 1965 to the present, States have regularly conformed to Congress’ alterations of the Medicaid Act.\nThe Chief Justice acknowledges that Congress may “condition the receipt of [federal] funds on the States’ complying with restrictions on the use of those funds,” ante, at 50, but nevertheless concludes that the 2010 expansion is unduly coercive.  His conclusion rests on three premises, each of them essential to his theory.  First, the Medicaid expansion is, in The Chief Justice’s view, a new grant program, not an addition to the Medicaid program existing before the ACA’s enactment.  Congress, The Chief Justice maintains, has threatened States with the loss of funds from an old program in an effort to get them to adopt a new one.  Second, the expansion was unforeseeable by the States when they first signed on to Medicaid.  Third, the threatened loss of funding is so large that the States have no real choice but to participate in the Medicaid expansion.  The Chief Justice therefore—for the first time ever—finds an exercise of Congress’ spending power unconstitutionally coercive.\nMedicaid, as amended by the ACA, however, is not two spending programs; it is a single program with a constant aim—to enable poor persons to receive basic health care  when they need it.  Given past expansions, plus express statutory warning that Congress may change the requirements participating States must meet, there can be no tenable claim that the ACA fails for lack of notice.  Moreover, States have no entitlement to receive any Medicaid funds; they enjoy only the opportunity to accept funds on Congress’ terms.  Future Congresses are not bound by their predecessors’ dispositions; they have authority to spend federal revenue as they see fit.  The Federal Government, therefore, is not, as The Chief Justice charges, threatening States with the loss of “existing” funds from one spending program in order to induce them to opt into another program.  Congress is simply requiring States to do what States have long been required to do to receive Medicaid funding: comply with the conditions Congress prescribes for participation.\nA majority of the Court, however, buys the argument that prospective withholding of funds formerly available exceeds Congress’ spending power.  Given that holding, I entirely agree with The Chief Justice as to the appropriate remedy.  It is to bar the withholding found impermissible—not, as the joint dissenters would have it, to scrap the expansion altogether, see post, at 46–48.  The dissenters’ view that the ACA must fall in its entirety is a radical departure from the Court’s normal course.  When a constitutional infirmity mars a statute, the Court ordinarily removes the infirmity.  It undertakes a salvage operation; it does not demolish the legislation.  See, e.g., Brockett v. Spokane Arcades, Inc., 472 U. S. 491, 504 (1985) (Court’s normal course is to declare a statute invalid “to the extent that it reaches too far, but otherwise [to leave the statute] intact”).  That course is plainly in order where, as in this case, Congress has expressly instructed courts to leave untouched every provision not found invalid.  See 42 U. S. C. §1303.  Because The Chief Justice finds the withholding—not the granting—of federal funds incom-  patible with the Spending Clause, Congress’ extension of Medicaid remains available to any State that affirms its willingness to participate.\nExpansion has been characteristic of the Medicaid program.  Akin to the ACA in 2010, the Medicaid Act as passed in 1965 augmented existing federal grant programs jointly administered with the States.13  States were not required to participate in Medicaid.  But if they did, the Federal Government paid at least half the costs.  To qual- ify for these grants, States had to offer a minimum level of health coverage to beneficiaries of four federally funded, state-administered welfare programs: Aid to Families with Dependent Children; Old Age Assistance; Aid to the Blind; and Aid to the Permanently and Totally Disabled.  See Social Security Amendments of 1965, §121(a), 79 Stat. 343; Schweiker v. Gray Panthers, 453 U. S. 34, 37 (1981).  At their option, States could enroll additional “medically needy” individuals; these costs, too, were partially borne by the Federal Government at the same, at least 50%, rate.  Ibid.\nSince 1965, Congress has amended the Medicaid program on more than 50 occasions, sometimes quite sizably.  Most relevant here, between 1988 and 1990, Congress  required participating States to include among their beneficiaries pregnant women with family incomes up to 133% of the federal poverty level, children up to age 6 at the same income levels, and children ages 6 to 18 with family incomes up to 100% of the poverty level.  See 42 U. S. C. §§1396a(a)(10)(A)(i), 1396a(l); Medicare Catastrophic Cov- erage Act of 1988, §302, 102 Stat. 750; Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1989, §6401, 103 Stat. 2258; Om- nibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990, §4601, 104 Stat. 1388–166.  These amendments added millions to the Medicaid-eligible population.  Dubay & Kenney, Lessons from the Medicaid Expansions for Children and Pregnant Women 5 (Apr. 1997).\nBetween 1966 and 1990, annual federal Medicaid spending grew from $631.6 million to $42.6 billion; state spending rose to $31 billion over the same period.  See Dept. of Health and Human Services, National Health Expenditures by Type of Service and Source of Funds: Calendar Years 1960 to 2010 (table).14  And between 1990 and 2010, federal spending increased to $269.5 billion.  Ibid.  Enlargement of the population and services covered by Medicaid, in short, has been the trend.\nCompared to past alterations, the ACA is notable for the extent to which the Federal Government will pick up the tab.  Medicaid’s 2010 expansion is financed largely by federal outlays.  In 2014, federal funds will cover 100% of the costs for newly eligible beneficiaries; that rate will gradually decrease before settling at 90% in 2020.  42 U. S. C. §1396d(y) (2006 ed., Supp. IV).  By comparison, federal contributions toward the care of beneficiaries eligible pre-ACA range from 50% to 83%, and averaged 57% between 2005 and 2008.  §1396d(b) (2006 ed., Supp.  IV); Dept. of Health and Human Services, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, C. Truffer et al., 2010 Actuarial Report on the Financial Outlook for Medicaid, p. 20.\nNor will the expansion exorbitantly increase state Medicaid spending.  The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projects that States will spend 0.8% more than they would have, absent the ACA.  See CBO, Spending & Enrollment Detail for CBO’s March 2009 Baseline.  But see ante, at 44–45 (“[T]he Act dramatically increases state obligations under Medicaid.”); post, at 45 (joint opinion of Scalia, Kennedy, Thomas, and Alito, JJ.) (“[A]cceptance of the [ACA expansion] will impose very substantial costs on participating States.”).  Whatever the increase in state obligations after the ACA, it will pale in comparison to the increase in federal funding.15\nFinally, any fair appraisal of Medicaid would require acknowledgment of the considerable autonomy States enjoy under the Act.  Far from “conscript[ing] state agencies into the national bureaucratic army,” ante, at 55 (citing FERC v. Mississippi, 456 U. S. 742, 775 (1982) (O’Connor, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part) (brackets in original and internal quotation marks omitted)), Medicaid “is designed to advance cooperative federalism.”  Wisconsin Dept. of Health and Family Servs. v. Blumer, 534 U. S. 473, 495 (2002) (citing Harris v. McRae, 448 U. S. 297, 308 (1980)).  Subject to its basic  requirements, the Medicaid Act empowers States to “select dramatically different levels of funding and coverage, alter and experiment with different financing and delivery modes, and opt to cover (or not to cover) a range of parti- cular procedures and therapies.  States have leveraged this policy discretion to generate a myriad of dramatically different Medicaid programs over the past several decades.”  Ruger, Of Icebergs and Glaciers, 75 Law & Contemp. Probs. 215, 233 (2012) (footnote omitted).  The ACA does not jettison this approach.  States, as first-line administrators, will continue to guide the distribution of substantial resources among their needy populations.\nThe alternative to conditional federal spending, it bears emphasis, is not state autonomy but state marginalization.16  In 1965, Congress elected to nationalize health coverage for seniors through Medicare.  It could similarly have established Medicaid as an exclusively federal program.  Instead, Congress gave the States the opportunity to partner in the program’s administration and development.  Absent from the nationalized model, of course, is the state-level policy discretion and experimentation that is Medicaid’s hallmark; undoubtedly the interests of federalism are better served when States retain a meaning- ful role in the implementation of a program of such importance.  See Caminker, State Sovereignty and Sub- ordinacy, 95 Colum. L. Rev. 1001, 1002–1003 (1995) (coopera- tive federalism can preserve “a significant role for state discretion in achieving specified federal goals, where the alternative is complete federal preemption of any state  regulatory role”); Rose-Ackerman, Cooperative Federalism and Co-optation, 92 Yale L. J. 1344, 1346 (1983) (“If the federal government begins to take full responsibility for social welfare spending and preempts the states, the result is likely to be weaker . . . state governments.”).17\nAlthough Congress “has no obligation to use its Spending Clause power to disburse funds to the States,” College Savings Bank v. Florida Prepaid Postsecondary Ed. Expense Bd., 527 U. S. 666, 686 (1999), it has provided Medicaid grants notable for their generosity and flexibility.  “[S]uch funds,” we once observed, “are gifts,” id., at 686–687, and so they have remained through decades of expansion in their size and scope.\nThe Spending Clause authorizes Congress “to pay the Debts and provide for the . . . general Welfare of the United States.”  Art. I, §8, cl. 1.  To ensure that federal funds granted to the States are spent “to ‘provide for the . . . general Welfare’ in the manner Congress intended,” ante, at 46, Congress must of course have authority to impose limitations on the States’ use of the federal dollars.  This Court, time and again, has respected Congress’ prescription of spending conditions, and has required States to abide by them.  See, e.g., Pennhurst, 451 U. S., at 17 (“[O]ur cases have long recognized that Congress may fix the terms on which it shall disburse federal money to the States.”).  In particular, we have recognized Congress’ prerogative to condition a State’s receipt of Medicaid  funding on compliance with the terms Congress set for participation in the program.  See, e.g., Harris, 448 U. S., at 301 (“[O]nce a State elects to participate [in Medicaid], it must comply with the requirements of [the Medicaid Act].”); Arkansas Dept. of Health and Human Servs. v. Ahlborn, 547 U. S. 268, 275 (2006); Frew v. Hawkins, 540 U. S. 431, 433 (2004); Atkins v. Rivera, 477 U. S. 154, 156–157 (1986).\nCongress’ authority to condition the use of federal funds is not confined to spending programs as first launched.  The legislature may, and often does, amend the law, imposing new conditions grant recipients henceforth must meet in order to continue receiving funds.  See infra, at 54 (describing Bennett v. Kentucky Dept. of Ed., 470 U. S. 656, 659–660 (1985) (enforcing restriction added five years after adoption of educational program)).\nYes, there are federalism-based limits on the use of Congress’ conditional spending power.  In the leading decision in this area, South Dakota v. Dole, 483 U. S. 203 (1987), the Court identified four criteria.  The conditions placed on federal grants to States must (a) promote the “general welfare,” (b) “unambiguously” inform States what is demanded of them, (c) be germane “to the federal interest in particular national projects or programs,” and (d) not “induce the States to engage in activities that would themselves be unconstitutional.”  Id., at 207–208, 210 (internal quotation marks omitted).18\nThe Court in Dole mentioned, but did not adopt, a further limitation, one hypothetically raised a half-century earlier: In “some circumstances,” Congress might be prohibited from offering a “financial inducement . . . so coer cive as to pass the point at which ‘pressure turns into compulsion.’ ”  Id., at 211 (quoting Steward Machine Co. v. Davis, 301 U. S. 548, 590 (1937)).  Prior to today’s decision, however, the Court has never ruled that the terms of any grant crossed the indistinct line between temptation and coercion.\nDole involved the National Minimum Drinking Age Act, 23 U. S. C. §158, enacted in 1984.  That Act directed the Secretary of Transportation to withhold 5% of the federal highway funds otherwise payable to a State if the State permitted purchase of alcoholic beverages by persons less than 21 years old.  Drinking age was not within the authority of Congress to regulate, South Dakota argued, because the Twenty-First Amendment gave the States exclusive power to control the manufacture, transportation, and consumption of alcoholic beverages.  The small percentage of highway-construction funds South Dakota stood to lose by adhering to 19 as the age of eligibility to purchase 3.2% beer, however, was not enough to qualify as coercion, the Court concluded.\nThis case does not present the concerns that led the Court in Dole even to consider the prospect of coercion.  In Dole, the condition—set 21 as the minimum drinking age— did not tell the States how to use funds Congress pro- vided for highway construction.  Further, in view of the Twenty-First Amendment, it was an open question whether Congress could directly impose a national minimum drinking age.\nThe ACA, in contrast, relates solely to the federally funded Medicaid program; if States choose not to comply, Congress has not threatened to withhold funds earmarked for any other program.  Nor does the ACA use Medicaid funding to induce States to take action Congress itself could not undertake.  The Federal Government undoubtedly could operate its own health-care program for poor persons, just as it operates Medicare for seniors’ health  care.  See supra, at 44.\nThat is what makes this such a simple case, and the Court’s decision so unsettling.  Congress, aiming to assist the needy, has appropriated federal money to subsidize state health-insurance programs that meet federal standards.  The principal standard the ACA sets is that the state program cover adults earning no more than 133% of the federal poverty line.  Enforcing that prescription ensures that federal funds will be spent on health care for the poor in furtherance of Congress’ present perception of the general welfare.\nThe Chief Justice asserts that the Medicaid expan- sion creates a “new health care program.”  Ante, at 54.  Moreover, States could “hardly anticipate” that Congress would “transform [the program] so dramatically.”  Ante, at 55.  Therefore, The Chief Justice maintains, Congress’ threat to withhold “old” Medicaid funds based on a State’s refusal to participate in the “new” program is a “threa[t] to terminate [an]other . . . independent gran[t].”  Ante, at 50, 52–53.  And because the threat to withhold a large amount of funds from one program “leaves the States with no real option but to acquiesce [in a newly created program],” The Chief Justice concludes, the Medicaid expansion is unconstitutionally coercive.  Ante, at 52.\nThe starting premise on which The Chief Justice’s coercion analysis rests is that the ACA did not really “extend” Medicaid; instead, Congress created an entirely new program to co-exist with the old.  The Chief Justice calls the ACA new, but in truth, it simply reaches more of America’s poor than Congress originally covered.\nMedicaid was created to enable States to provide medical assistance to “needy persons.”  See S. Rep. No. 404,  89th Cong., 1st Sess., pt. 1, p. 9 (1965).  See also §121(a), 79 Stat. 343 (The purpose of Medicaid is to enable States “to furnish . . . medical assistance on behalf of [certain persons] whose income and resources are insufficient to meet the costs of necessary medical services.”).  By bringing health care within the reach of a larger population of Americans unable to afford it, the Medicaid expansion is an extension of that basic aim.\nThe Medicaid Act contains hundreds of provisions governing operation of the program, setting conditions ranging from “Limitation on payments to States for expend- itures attributable to taxes,” 42 U. S. C. §1396a(t) (2006 ed.), to “Medical assistance to aliens not lawfully admitted for permanent residence,” §1396b(v) (2006 ed. and Supp. IV).  The Medicaid expansion leaves unchanged the vast majority of these provisions; it adds beneficiaries to the existing program and specifies the rate at which States will be reimbursed for services provided to the added bene- ficiaries.  See ACA §§2001(a)(1), (3), 124 Stat. 271–272.  The ACA does not describe operational aspects of the program for these newly eligible persons; for that information, one must read the existing Medicaid Act.  See 42 U. S. C. §§1396–1396v(b) (2006 ed. and Supp. IV).\nCongress styled and clearly viewed the Medicaid expansion as an amendment to the Medicaid Act, not as a “new” health-care program.  To the four categories of beneficiaries for whom coverage became mandatory in 1965, and the three mandatory classes added in the late 1980’s, see supra, at 41–42, the ACA adds an eighth: individuals under 65 with incomes not exceeding 133% of the federal poverty level.  The expansion is effectuated by §2001 of the ACA, aptly titled: “Medicaid Coverage for the Lowest Income Populations.”  124 Stat. 271.  That section amends Title 42, Chapter 7, Subchapter XIX: Grants to States for Medical Assistance Programs.  Commonly known as the Medicaid Act, Subchapter XIX filled some 278 pages in  2006.  Section 2001 of the ACA would add approximately three pages.19\nCongress has broad authority to construct or adjust spending programs to meet its contemporary understanding of “the general Welfare.”  Helvering v. Davis, 301 U. S. 619, 640–641 (1937).  Courts owe a large measure of respect to Congress’ characterization of the grant programs it establishes.  See Steward Machine, 301 U. S., at 594.  Even if courts were inclined to second-guess Congress’ conception of the character of its legislation, how would reviewing judges divine whether an Act of Congress, purporting to amend a law, is in reality not an amendment, but a new creation?  At what point does an extension become so large that it “transforms” the basic law?\nEndeavoring to show that Congress created a new program, The Chief Justice cites three aspects of the expansion.  First, he asserts that, in covering those earning no more than 133% of the federal poverty line, the Medicaid expansion, unlike pre-ACA Medicaid, does not “care for the neediest among us.”  Ante, at 53.  What makes that so?  Single adults earning no more than $14,856 per year—133% of the current federal poverty level—surely rank among the Nation’s poor.\nSecond, according to The Chief Justice, “Congress mandated that newly eligible persons receive a level of coverage that is less comprehensive than the traditional Medicaid benefit package.”  Ibid.  That less comprehensive benefit package, however, is not an innovation introduced by the ACA; since 2006, States have been free to use it for many of their Medicaid beneficiaries.20  The level of bene fits offered therefore does not set apart post-ACA Medicaid recipients from all those entitled to benefits pre-ACA.\nThird, The Chief Justice correctly notes that the reimbursement rate for participating States is differ- ent regarding individuals who became Medicaid-eligible through the ACA.  Ibid.  But the rate differs only in its generosity to participating States.  Under pre-ACA Medicaid, the Federal Government pays up to 83% of the costs of coverage for current enrollees, §1396d(b) (2006 ed. and Supp. IV); under the ACA, the federal contribution starts at 100% and will eventually settle at 90%, §1396d(y).  Even if one agreed that a change of as little as 7 percentage points carries constitutional significance, is it not passing strange to suggest that the purported incursion on state sovereignty might have been averted, or at least mitigated, had Congress offered States less money to carry out the same obligations?\nConsider also that Congress could have repealed Medicaid.  See supra, at 38–39 (citing 42 U. S. C. §1304); Brief for Petitioners in No. 11–400, p. 41.  Thereafter, Congress could have enacted Medicaid II, a new program combin- ing the pre-2010 coverage with the expanded coverage required by the ACA.  By what right does a court stop Congress from building up without first tearing down?\nThe Chief Justice finds the Medicaid expansion vulnerable because it took participating States by surprise.  Ante, at 54.  “A State could hardly anticipate that Congres[s]” would endeavor to “transform [the Medicaid program] so dramatically,” he states.  Ante, at 54–55.  For the notion that States must be able to foresee, when they sign up, alterations Congress might make later on, The Chief Justice cites only one case: Pennhurst State School and Hospital v. Halderman, 451 U. S. 1.\nIn Pennhurst, residents of a state-run, federally funded institution for the mentally disabled complained of abusive treatment and inhumane conditions in alleged violation of the Developmentally Disabled Assistance and Bill of Rights Act.  451 U. S., at 5–6.  We held that the State was not answerable in damages for violating conditions it did not “voluntarily and knowingly accep[t].”  Id., at 17, 27.  Inspecting the statutory language and legislative his- tory, we found that the Act did not “unambiguously” impose the requirement on which the plaintiffs relied: that they receive appropriate treatment in the least restrictive environment.  Id., at 17–18.  Satisfied that Congress had not clearly conditioned the States’ receipt of federal funds on the States’ provision of such treatment, we declined to read such a requirement into the Act.  Congress’ spending power, we concluded, “does not include surprising participating States with postacceptance or ‘retroactive’ conditions.”  Id., at 24–25.\nPennhurst thus instructs that “if Congress intends to impose a condition on the grant of federal moneys, it must do so unambiguously.”  Ante, at 53 (quoting Pennhurst, 451 U. S., at 17).  That requirement is met in this case.  Section 2001 does not take effect until 2014.  The ACA makes perfectly clear what will be required of States that accept Medicaid funding after that date: They must extend eligibility to adults with incomes no more than 133% of the federal poverty line.  See 42 U. S. C. §1396a(a)(10)(A) (i)(VIII) (2006 ed. and Supp. IV).\nThe Chief Justice appears to find in Pennhurst a requirement that, when spending legislation is first passed, or when States first enlist in the federal program, Congress must provide clear notice of conditions it might later impose.  If I understand his point correctly, it was incumbent on Congress, in 1965, to warn the States clearly  of the size and shape potential changes to Medicaid might take.  And absent such notice, sizable changes could not be made mandatory.  Our decisions do not support such a requirement.21\nIn Bennett v. New Jersey, 470 U. S. 632 (1985), the Secretary of Education sought to recoup Title I funds22 based on the State’s noncompliance, from 1970 to 1972, with a 1978 amendment to Title I.  Relying on Pennhurst, we rejected the Secretary’s attempt to recover funds based on the States’ alleged violation of a rule that did not exist when the State accepted and spent the funds.  See 470 U. S., at 640 (“New Jersey[,] when it applied for and received Title I funds for the years 1970–1972[,] had no basis to believe that the propriety of the expenditures would be judged by any standards other than the ones in effect at the time.” (citing Pennhurst, 451 U. S., at 17, 24–25; emphasis added)).\nWhen amendment of an existing grant program has no such retroactive effect, however, we have upheld Congress’ instruction.  In Bennett v. Kentucky Dept. of Ed., 470 U. S. 656 (1985), the Secretary sued to recapture Title I funds based on the Commonwealth’s 1974 violation of a spending condition Congress added to Title I in 1970.  Rejecting Kentucky’s argument pinned to Pennhurst, we held that  the Commonwealth suffered no surprise after accepting the federal funds.  Kentucky was therefore obliged to re- turn the money.  470 U. S., at 665–666, 673–674.  The conditions imposed were to be assessed as of 1974, in light of “the legal requirements in place when the grants were made,” id., at 670, not as of 1965, when Title I was originally enacted.\nAs these decisions show, Pennhurst’s rule demands that conditions on federal funds be unambiguously clear at the time a State receives and uses the money—not at the time, perhaps years earlier, when Congress passed the law establishing the program.  See also Dole, 483 U. S., at 208 (finding Pennhurst satisfied based on the clarity of the Federal Aid Highway Act as amended in 1984, without looking back to 1956, the year of the Act’s adoption).\nIn any event, from the start, the Medicaid Act put States on notice that the program could be changed: “The right to alter, amend, or repeal any provision of [Medicaid],” the statute has read since 1965, “is hereby reserved to the Congress.”  42 U. S. C. §1304.  The “effect of these few simple words” has long been settled.  See National Railroad Passenger Corporation v. Atchison, T. & S. F. R. Co., 470 U. S. 451, 467–468, n. 22 (1985) (citing Sinking Fund Cases, 99 U. S. 700, 720 (1879)).  By reserving the right to “alter, amend, [or] repeal” a spending program, Congress “has given special notice of its intention to retain . . . full and complete power to make such alterations and amendments . . . as come within the just scope of legislative power.”  Id., at 720.\nOur decision in Bowen v. Public Agencies Opposed to Social Security Entrapment, 477 U. S. 41, 51–52 (1986), is guiding here.  As enacted in 1935, the Social Security Act did not cover state employees.  Id., at 44.  In response to pressure from States that wanted coverage for their employees, Congress, in 1950, amended the Act to allow States to opt into the program.  Id., at 45.  The statutory  provision giving States this option expressly permitted them to withdraw from the program.  Ibid.\nBeginning in the late 1970’s, States increasingly exercised the option to withdraw.  Id., at 46.  Concerned that withdrawals were threatening the integrity of Social Security, Congress repealed the termination provision.  Congress thereby changed Social Security from a program voluntary for the States to one from which they could not escape.  Id., at 48.  California objected, arguing that the change impermissibly deprived it of a right to withdraw from Social Security.  Id., at 49–50.  We unanimously rejected California’s argument.  Id., at 51–53.  By including in the Act “a clause expressly reserving to it ‘[t]he right to alter, amend, or repeal any provision’ of the Act,” we held, Congress put States on notice that the Act “created no contractual rights.”  Id., at 51–52.  The States therefore had no law-based ground on which to complain about the amendment, despite the significant character of the change.\nThe Chief Justice nevertheless would rewrite §1304 to countenance only the “right to alter somewhat,” or “amend, but not too much.”  Congress, however, did not so qualify §1304.  Indeed, Congress retained discretion to “repeal” Medicaid, wiping it out entirely.  Cf. Delta Air Lines, Inc. v. August, 450 U. S. 346, 368 (1981) (Rehnquist, J., dissenting) (invoking “the common-sense maxim that the greater includes the lesser”).  As Bowen indicates, no State could reasonably have read §1304 as reserving to Congress authority to make adjustments only if modestly sized.\nIn fact, no State proceeded on that understanding.  In com- pliance with Medicaid regulations, each State expressly undertook to abide by future Medicaid changes.  See 42 CFR §430.12(c)(1) (2011) (“The [state Medicaid] plan must provide that it will be amended whenever necessary to reflect . . . [c]hanges in Federal law, regulations, policy  interpretations, or court decisions.”).  Whenever a State notifies the Federal Government of a change in its own Medicaid program, the State certifies both that it knows the federally set terms of participation may change, and that it will abide by those changes as a condition of continued participation.  See, e.g., Florida Agency for Health Care Admin., State Plan Under Title XIX of the Social Security Act Medical Assistance Program §7.1, p. 86 (Oct. 6, 1992).\nThe Chief Justice insists that the most recent expansion, in contrast to its predecessors, “accomplishes a shift in kind, not merely degree.”  Ante, at 53.  But why was Medicaid altered only in degree, not in kind, when Congress required States to cover millions of children and pregnant women?  See supra, at 41–42.  Congress did not “merely alte[r] and expan[d] the boundaries of” the Aid to Families with Dependent Children program.  But see ante, at 53–55.  Rather, Congress required participating States to provide coverage tied to the federal poverty level (as it later did in the ACA), rather than to the AFDC program.  See Brief for National Health Law Program et al. as Amici Curiae 16–18.  In short, given §1304, this Court’s construction of §1304’s language in Bowen, and the enlargement of Medicaid in the years since 1965,23 a State would be hard put to complain that it lacked fair notice when, in 2010, Congress altered Medicaid to embrace a larger portion of the Nation’s poor.\nThe Chief Justice ultimately asks whether “the finan cial inducement offered by Congress . . . pass[ed] the point at which pressure turns into compulsion.”  Ante, at 50 (internal quotation marks omitted).  The financial inducement Congress employed here, he concludes, crosses that threshold: The threatened withholding of “existing Medicaid funds” is “a gun to the head” that forces States to acquiesce.  Ante, at 50–51 (citing 42 U. S. C. §1396c).24\nThe Chief Justice sees no need to “fix the outermost line,” Steward Machine, 301 U. S., at 591, “where persuasion gives way to coercion,” ante, at 55.  Neither do the joint dissenters.  See post, at 36, 38.25  Notably, the deci sion on which they rely, Steward Machine, found the statute at issue inside the line, “wherever the line may be.”  301 U. S., at 591.\nWhen future Spending Clause challenges arrive, as they likely will in the wake of today’s decision, how will litigants and judges assess whether “a State has a legitimate choice whether to accept the federal conditions in exchange for federal funds”?  Ante, at 48.  Are courts to measure the number of dollars the Federal Government might withhold for noncompliance?  The portion of the State’s budget at stake?  And which State’s—or States’—budget is determinative: the lead plaintiff, all challenging States (26 in this case, many with quite different fiscal situations), or some national median? Does it matter that Florida, unlike most States, imposes no state income tax, and therefore might be able to replace foregone federal funds with new state revenue?26  Or that the coercion state  officials in fact fear is punishment at the ballot box for turning down a politically popular federal grant?\nThe coercion inquiry, therefore, appears to involve polit- ical judgments that defy judicial calculation.  See Bakerv. Carr, 369 U. S. 186, 217 (1962).  Even commentators sympathetic to robust enforcement of Dole’s limitations, see supra, at 46, have concluded that conceptions of “impermissible coercion” premised on States’ perceived inability to decline federal funds “are just too amorphous to be judicially administrable.”  Baker & Berman, Getting off the Dole, 78 Ind. L. J. 459, 521, 522, n. 307 (2003) (citing, e.g., Scalia, The Rule of Law as a Law of Rules, 56 U. Chi. L. Rev. 1175 (1989)).\nAt bottom, my colleagues’ position is that the States’ reliance on federal funds limits Congress’ authority to alter its spending programs.  This gets things backwards: Congress, not the States, is tasked with spending federal money in service of the general welfare.  And each successive Congress is empowered to appropriate funds as it sees fit.  When the 110th Congress reached a conclusion about Medicaid funds that differed from its predecessors’ view, it abridged no State’s right to “existing,” or “pre-existing,” funds.  But see ante, at 51–52; post, at 47–48 (joint opinion of Scalia, Kennedy, Thomas, and Alito, JJ.).  For, in  fact, there are no such funds.  There is only money States anticipate receiving from future Congresses.\nCongress has delegated to the Secretary of Health and Human Services the authority to withhold, in whole or in part, federal Medicaid funds from States that fail to comply with the Medicaid Act as originally composed and as subsequently amended.  42 U. S. C. §1396c.27 The Chief Justice, however, holds that the Constitution precludes the Secretary from withholding “existing” Medicaid funds based on States’ refusal to comply with the expanded Medi- caid program.  Ante, at 55.  For the foregoing reasons, I disagree that any such withholding would violate the Spending Clause.  Accordingly, I would affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit in this regard.\nBut in view of The Chief Justice’s disposition, I agree with him that the Medicaid Act’s severability clause determines the appropriate remedy.  That clause provides that “[i]f any provision of [the Medicaid Act], or the application thereof to any person or circumstance, is held in- valid, the remainder of the chapter, and the application of such provision to other persons or circumstances shall not be affected thereby.”  42 U. S. C. §1303.\nThe Court does not strike down any provision of the  ACA.  It prohibits only the “application” of the Secretary’s authority to withhold Medicaid funds from States that decline to conform their Medicaid plans to the ACA’s requirements.  Thus the ACA’s authorization of funds to finance the expansion remains intact, and the Secretary’s authority to withhold funds for reasons other than noncompliance with the expansion remains unaffected.\nEven absent §1303’s command, we would have no warrant to invalidate the Medicaid expansion, contra post, at 46–48 (joint opinion of Scalia, Kennedy, Thomas, and Alito, JJ.), not to mention the entire ACA, post, at 49–64 (same).  For when a court confronts an unconstitutional statute, its endeavor must be to conserve, not destroy, the legislature’s dominant objective.  See, e.g., Ayotte v. Planned Parenthood of Northern New Eng., 546 U. S. 320, 328–330 (2006).  In this case, that objective was to increase access to health care for the poor by increasing the States’ access to federal funds.  The Chief Justice is undoubtedly right to conclude that Congress may offer States funds “to expand the availability of health care, and requir[e] that States accepting such funds comply with the conditions on their use.”  Ante, at 55.  I therefore concur in the judgment with respect to Part IV–B of The Chief Justice’s opinion.\nFor the reasons stated, I agree with The Chief Justice that, as to the validity of the minimum coverage provi- sion, the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit should be reversed.  In my view, the provision en- counters no constitutional obstruction.  Further, I would uphold the Eleventh Circuit’s decision that the Medicaid expansion is within Congress’ spending power.\n1  According to one study conducted by the National Center for Health Statistics, the high cost of insurance is the most common reason why individuals lack coverage, followed by loss of one’s job, an employer’s unwillingness to offer insurance or an insurers’ unwillingness to cover those with preexisting medical conditions, and loss of Medicaid coverage.  See Dept. of Health and Human Services, National Center for Health Statistics, Summary Health Statistics for the U. S. Population: National Health Interview Survey—2009, Ser. 10, No. 248, p. 71, Table 25 (Dec. 2010).  “[D]id not want or need coverage” received too few re- sponses to warrant its own category.  See ibid., n. 2.\n2  Despite its success, Massachusetts’ medical-care providers still administer substantial amounts of uncompensated care, much of that to uninsured patients from out-of-state.  See supra, at 7–8.\n3  Alexander Hamilton described the problem this way:  “[Often] it would be beneficial to all the states to encourage, or suppress[,] a particular branch of trade, while it would be detrimental . . . to attempt it without the concurrence of the rest.”  The Continentalist No. V, in 3 Papers of Alexander Hamilton 75, 78 (H. Syrett ed. 1962).  Because the concurrence of all States was exceedingly difficult to obtain, Hamilton observed, “the experiment would probably be left untried.”  Ibid.\n4  See Dept. of Health and Human Services, National Center for Health Statistics, Summary Health Statistics for U. S. Adults: National Health Interview Survey 2009, Ser. 10, No. 249, p. 124, Table 37 (Dec. 2010).\n5  Echoing The Chief Justice, the joint dissenters urge that the minimum coverage provision impermissibly regulates young people who “have no intention of purchasing [medical care]” and are too far “removed from the [health-care] market.”  See post, at 8, 11.  This criticism ignores the reality that a healthy young person may be a day away from needing health care.  See supra, at 4.  A victim of an accident or unforeseen illness will consume extensive medical care immediately, though scarcely expecting to do so.\n6  The Chief Justice’s reliance on the quoted passages of the Constitution, see ante, at 18–19, is also dubious on other grounds.  The power to “regulate the Value” of the national currency presumably includes the power to increase the currency’s worth—i.e., to create value where none previously existed.  And if the power to “[r]egulat[e] . . . the land and naval Forces” presupposes “there is already [in existence] something to be regulated,” i.e., an Army and a Navy, does Congress lack authority to create an Air Force?\n7  The Chief Justice’s characterization of individuals who choose not to purchase private insurance as “doing nothing,” ante, at 20, is simi- larly questionable.  A person who self-insures opts against prepayment for a product the person will in time consume.  When aggregated, exercise of that option has a substantial impact on the health-care market.  See supra, at 5–7, 16–17.\n8  Some adherents to the joint dissent have questioned the existence of substantive due process rights.  See McDonald v. Chicago, 561 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (Thomas, J., concurring) (slip op., at 7) (The notion that the Due Process Clause “could define the substance of th[e] righ[t to liberty] strains credulity.”); Albright v. Oliver, 510 U. S. 266, 275 (1994) (Scalia, J., concurring) (“I reject the proposition that the Due Process Clause guarantees certain (unspecified) liberties[.]”).  Given these Justices’ reluctance to interpret the Due Process Clause as guaranteeing liberty interests, their willingness to plant such protections in the Commerce Clause is striking.\n9  The failure to purchase vegetables in The Chief Justice’s hypothetical, then, is not what leads to higher health-care costs for others; rather, it is the failure of individuals to maintain a healthy diet, and the resulting obesity, that creates the cost-shifting problem.  See ante, at 22–23.  Requiring individuals to purchase vegetables is thus several steps removed from solving the problem.  The failure to obtain health insurance, by contrast, is the immediate cause of the cost-shifting Congress sought to address through the ACA.  See supra, at 5–7.  Requiring individuals to obtain insurance attacks the source of the problem directly, in a single step.\n10  Indeed, Congress regularly and uncontroversially requires individuals who are “doing nothing,” see ante, at 20, to take action.  Exam- ples include federal requirements to report for jury duty, 28 U. S. C. §1866(g) (2006 ed., Supp. IV); to register for selective service, 50 U. S. C. App. §453; to purchase firearms and gear in anticipation of service in the Militia, 1 Stat. 271 (Uniform Militia Act of 1792); to turn gold currency over to the Federal Government in exchange for paper currency, see Nortz v. United States, 294 U. S. 317, 328 (1935); and to file a tax return, 26 U. S. C. §6012 (2006 ed., Supp. IV).\n11  In a separate argument, the joint dissenters contend that the minimum coverage provision is not necessary and proper because it was not the “only . . . way” Congress could have made the guaranteed-issue and community-rating reforms work.  Post, at 9–10.  Congress could also have avoided an insurance-market death spiral, the dissenters maintain, by imposing a surcharge on those who did not previously purchase insurance when those individuals eventually enter the health-insurance system.  Post, at 10.  Or Congress could “den[y] a full income tax credit” to those who do not purchase insurance.  Ibid. Neither a surcharge on those who purchase insurance nor the denial of a tax credit to those who do not would solve the problem created by guaranteed-issue and community-rating requirements.  Neither would prompt the purchase of insurance before sickness or injury occurred. But even assuming there were “practicable” alternatives to the minimum coverage provision, “we long ago rejected the view that the Necessary and Proper Clause demands that an Act of Congress be ‘absolutely necessary’ to the exercise of an enumerated power.”  Jinks v. Richland County, 538 U. S. 456, 462 (2003) (quoting McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 414–415 (1819)).  Rather, the statutory provision at issue need only be “conducive” and “[reasonably] adapted” to the goal Congress seeks to achieve.  Jinks, 538 U. S., at 462 (internal quotation marks omitted).  The minimum coverage provision meets this requirement.  See supra, at 31–33.\n12  The Chief Justice states that he must evaluate the constitution- ality of the minimum coverage provision under the Commerce Clause because the provision “reads more naturally as a command to buy insurance than as a tax.”  Ante, at 44.  The Chief Justice ultimately concludes, however, that interpreting the provision as a tax is a “fairly possible” construction.  Ante, at 32 (internal quotation marks omitted).  That being so, I see no reason to undertake a Commerce Clause analysis that is not outcome determinative.\n13  Medicaid was “plainly an extension of the existing Kerr-Mills” grant program.  Huberfeld, Federalizing Medicaid, 14 U. Pa. J. Const. L. 431, 444–445 (2011).  Indeed, the “section of the Senate report dealing with Title XIX”—the title establishing Medicaid—“was entitled, ‘Improvement and Extension of Kerr-Mills Medical Assistance Program.’ ”  Stevens & Stevens, Welfare Medicine in America 51 (1974) (quoting S. Rep. No. 404, 89th Cong., 1st Sess., pt. 1, p. 9 (1965)).  Setting the pattern for Medicaid, Kerr-Mills reimbursed States for a portion of the cost of health care provided to welfare recipients if States met conditions specified in the federal law, e.g., participating States were obliged to offer minimum coverage for hospitalization and physician services.  See Huberfeld, supra, at 443–444.\n14  Available online at http://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data- and-Systems/Statistics-Trends-and-Reports/NationalHealthExpendData/ NationalHealthAccountsHistorical.html.\n15  Even the study on which the plaintiffs rely, see Brief for Petitioners 10, concludes that “[w]hile most states will experience some increase in spending, this is quite small relative to the federal matching payments and low relative to the costs of uncompensated care that [the states] would bear if the[re] were no health reform.”  See Kaiser Commission on Medicaid & the Uninsured, Medicaid Coverage & Spending in Health Reform 16 (May 2010).  Thus there can be no objection to the ACA’s expansion of Medicaid as an “unfunded mandate.”  Quite the contrary, the program is impressively well funded.\n16  In 1972, for example, Congress ended the federal cash-assistance program for the aged, blind, and disabled.  That program previously had been operated jointly by the Federal and State Governments, as is the case with Medicaid today.  Congress replaced the cooperative federal program with the nationalized Supplemental Security In- come (SSI) program.  See Schweiker v. Gray Panthers, 453 U. S. 34, 38 (1981).\n17  The Chief Justice and the joint dissenters perceive in cooperative federalism a “threa[t]” to “political accountability.”  Ante, at 48; see post, at 34–35.  By that, they mean voter confusion: Citizens upset by unpopular government action, they posit, may ascribe to state officials blame more appropriately laid at Congress’ door.  But no such confusion is apparent in this case: Medicaid’s status as a federally funded, state-administered program is hardly hidden from view.\n18  Although the plaintiffs, in the proceedings below, did not contest the ACA’s satisfaction of these criteria, see 648 F. 3d 1235, 1263 (CA11 2011), The Chief Justice appears to rely heavily on the second crite- rion.  Compare ante, at 52, 54, with infra, at 52–54.\n19  Compare Subchapter XIX, 42 U. S. C. §§1396–1396v(b) (2006 ed. and Supp. IV) with §§1396a(a) (10)(A)(i)(VIII) (2006 ed. and Supp. IV); 1396a(a) (10)(A)(ii)(XX), 1396a(a)(75), 1396a(k), 1396a(gg) to (hh), 1396d(y), 1396r–1(e), 1396u–7(b)(5) to (6).\n20  The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 authorized States to provide “benchmark coverage” or “benchmark equivalent coverage” to certain Medicaid populations.  See §6044, 120 Stat. 88, 42 U. S. C. §1396u–7 (2006 ed. and Supp. IV).  States may offer the same level of coverage to persons newly eligible under the ACA.  See §1396a(k).\n21  The Chief Justice observes that “Spending Clause legislation [i]s much in the nature of a contract.”  Ante, at 46 (internal quotation marks omitted).  See also post, at 33 (joint opinion of Scalia, Kennedy, Thomas, and Alito, JJ.) (same).  But the Court previously has rec- ognized that “[u]nlike normal contractual undertakings, federal grant programs originate in and remain governed by statutory provisions expressing the judgment of Congress concerning desirable public policy.”  Bennett v. Kentucky Dept. of Ed., 470 U. S. 656, 669 (1985).\n22  Title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 provided federal grants to finance supplemental educational programs in school districts with high concentrations of children from low-income families.  See Bennett v. New Jersey, 470 U. S. 632, 634–635 (1985) (citing Pub. L. No. 89–10, 79 Stat. 27).\n23  Note, in this regard, the extension of Social Security, which began in 1935 as an old-age pension program, then expanded to include sur- vivor benefits in 1939 and disability benefits in 1956.  See Social Security Act, ch. 531, 49 Stat. 622–625; Social Security Act Amendments of 1939, 53 Stat. 1364–1365; Social Security Amendments of 1956, ch. 836,  §103, 70 Stat. 815–816.\n24  The joint dissenters, for their part, would make this the entire inquiry.  “[I]f States really have no choice other than to accept the package,” they assert, “the offer is coercive.”  Post, at 35.  The Chief Justice recognizes Congress’ authority to construct a single federal program and “condition the receipt of funds on the States’ complying with restrictions on the use of those funds.”  Ante, at 50.  For the joint dissenters, however, all that matters, it appears, is whether States can resist the temptation of a given federal grant.  Post, at 35.  On this logic, any federal spending program, sufficiently large and well-funded, would be unconstitutional.  The joint dissenters point to smaller programs States might have the will to refuse.  See post, at 40–41 (elementary and secondary education).  But how is a court to judge whether “only 6.6% of all state expenditures,” post, at 41, is an amount States could or would do without? Speculations of this genre are characteristic of the joint dissent.  See, e.g., post, at 35 (“it may be state officials who will bear the brunt of public disapproval” for joint federal-state endeavors); ibid., (“federal officials . . . may remain insulated from the electoral ramifications of their decision”); post, at 37 (“a heavy federal tax . . . levied to support a federal program that offers large grants to the States . . . may, as a practical matter, [leave States] unable to refuse to participate”); ibid. (withdrawal from a federal program “would likely force the State to impose a huge tax increase”); post, at 46 (state share of ACA expansion costs “may increase in the future”) (all emphasis added; some internal quotation marks omitted).  The joint dissenters are long on conjecture and short on real-world examples.\n25  The joint dissenters also rely heavily on Congress’ perceived intent to coerce the States.  Post, at 42–46; see, e.g., post, at 42 (“In crafting the ACA, Congress clearly expressed its informed view that no State could possibly refuse the offer that the ACA extends.”).  We should not lightly ascribe to Congress an intent to violate the Constitution (at least as my colleagues read it).  This is particularly true when the ACA could just as well be comprehended as demonstrating Congress’ mere expectation, in light of the uniformity of past participation and the generosity of the federal contribution, that States would not withdraw.  Cf. South Dakota v. Dole, 483 U. S. 203, 211 (1987) (“We cannot conclude . . . that a con- ditional grant of federal money . . . is unconstitutional simply by reason of its success in achieving the congressional objective.”).\n26  Federal taxation of a State’s citizens, according to the joint dissenters, may diminish a State’s ability to raise new revenue.  This, in turn, could limit a State’s capacity to replace a federal program with an “equivalent” state-funded analog.  Post, at 40.  But it cannot be true that “the amount of the federal taxes extracted from the taxpayers of a State to pay for the program in question is relevant in determining whether there is impermissible coercion.”  Post, at 37.  When the United States Government taxes United States citizens, it taxes them “in their individual capacities” as “the people of America”—not as residents of a particular State.  See U. S. Term Limits, Inc. v. Thornton, 514 U. S. 779, 839 (1995) (Kennedy, J., concurring).  That is because the “Framers split the atom of sovereignty[,] . . . establishing two orders of government”—“one state and one federal”—“each with its own direct relationship” to the people.  Id., at 838. A State therefore has no claim on the money its residents pay in federal taxes, and federal “spending programs need not help people in all states in the same measure.”  See Brief for David Satcher et al. as Amici Curiae 19.  In 2004, for example, New Jersey received 55 cents in federal spending for every dollar its residents paid to the Federal Government in taxes, while Mississippi received $1.77 per tax dollar paid.  C. Dubay, Tax Foundation, Federal Tax Burdens and Expenditures by State: Which States Gain Most from Federal Fiscal Operations?  2 (Mar. 2006).  Thus no constitutional problem was created when Arizona declined for 16 years to participate in Medicaid, even though its residents’ tax dollars financed Medicaid programs in every other State.\n27  As The Chief Justice observes, the Secretary is authorized to withhold all of a State’s Medicaid funding.  See ante, at 51.  But total withdrawal is what the Secretary may, not must, do.  She has discretion to withhold only a portion of the Medicaid funds otherwise due a noncompliant State.  See §1396c; cf. 45 CFR §80.10(f) (2011) (Secretary may enforce Title VI’s nondiscrimination requirement through “refusal to grant or continue Federal financial assistance, in whole or in part.” (emphasis added)).  The Secretary, it is worth noting, may herself experience political pressures, which would make her all the more reluctant to cut off funds Congress has appropriated for a State’s needy citizens.\nSUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES\n_________________\nNos. 11–393, 11–398 and 11–400\n_________________\nNATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT BUSINESS, et al., PETITIONERS\n11–393 v.\nKATHLEEN SEBELIUS, SECRETARY OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, et al.\nDEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, et al., PETITIONERS\n11–398 v.\nFLORIDA et al.\nFLORIDA, et al., PETITIONERS\n11–400 v.\nDEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES et al.\nJustice Scalia, Justice Kennedy, Justice Thomas, and Justice Alito, dissenting.\nCongress has set out to remedy the problem that the best health care is beyond the reach of many Americans who cannot afford it.  It can assuredly do that, by exercising the powers accorded to it under the Constitution.  The question in this case, however, is whether the complex structures and provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Affordable Care Act or ACA) go be- yond those powers.  We conclude that they do.\nThis case is in one respect difficult: it presents two  questions of first impression.  The first of those is whether failure to engage in economic activity (the purchase of health insurance) is subject to regulation under the Commerce Clause.  Failure to act does result in an effect on commerce, and hence might be said to come under this Court’s “affecting commerce” criterion of Commerce Clause jurisprudence.  But in none of its decisions has this Court extended the Clause that far.  The second question is whether the congressional power to tax and spend, U. S. Const., Art. I, §8, cl. 1, permits the conditioning of a State’s continued receipt of all funds under a massive state-administered federal welfare program upon its acceptance of an expansion to that program.  Several of our opinions have suggested that the power to tax and spend cannot be used to coerce state administration of a federal program, but we have never found a law enacted under the spending power to be coercive.  Those questions are difficult.\nThe case is easy and straightforward, however, in another respect.  What is absolutely clear, affirmed by the text of the 1789 Constitution, by the Tenth Amendment ratified in 1791, and by innumerable cases of ours in the 220 years since, is that there are structural limits upon federal power—upon what it can prescribe with respect to private conduct, and upon what it can impose upon the sovereign States.  Whatever may be the conceptual limits upon the Commerce Clause and upon the power to tax and spend, they cannot be such as will enable the Federal Government to regulate all private conduct and to com- pel the States to function as administrators of federal programs.\nThat clear principle carries the day here.  The striking case of Wickard v. Filburn, 317 U. S. 111 (1942), which held that the economic activity of growing wheat, even for one’s own consumption, affected commerce sufficiently that it could be regulated, always has been regarded as  the ne plus ultra of expansive Commerce Clause jurisprudence.  To go beyond that, and to say the failure to grow wheat (which is not an economic activity, or any activity at all) nonetheless affects commerce and therefore can be federally regulated, is to make mere breathing in and out the basis for federal prescription and to extend federal power to virtually all human activity.\nAs for the constitutional power to tax and spend for the general welfare: The Court has long since expanded that beyond (what Madison thought it meant) taxing and spending for those aspects of the general welfare that were within the Federal Government’s enumerated powers, see United States v. Butler, 297 U. S. 1, 65–66 (1936).  Thus, we now have sizable federal Departments devoted to subjects not mentioned among Congress’ enumerated powers, and only marginally related to commerce: the De- partment of Education, the Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Housing and Urban Development.  The principal practical obstacle that prevents Congress from using the tax-and-spend power to assume all the general-welfare responsibilities traditionally exercised by the States is the sheer impossibility of managing a Federal Government large enough to administer such a system.  That obstacle can be overcome by granting funds to the States, allowing them to administer the program.  That is fair and constitutional enough when the States freely agree to have their powers employed and their employees enlisted in the federal scheme.  But it is a blatant violation of the constitutional structure when the States have no choice.\nThe Act before us here exceeds federal power both in mandating the purchase of health insurance and in denying nonconsenting States all Medicaid funding.  These parts of the Act are central to its design and operation, and all the Act’s other provisions would not have been enacted without them.  In our view it must follow that the  entire statute is inoperative.\nThe Individual Mandate\nArticle I, §8, of the Constitution gives Congress the power to “regulate Commerce . . . among the several States.”  The Individual Mandate in the Act commands that every “applicable individual shall for each month beginning after 2013 ensure that the individual, and any dependent of the individual who is an applicable individ- ual, is covered under minimum essential coverage.”  26 U. S. C. §5000A(a) (2006 ed., Supp. IV).  If this provision “regulates” anything, it is the failure to maintain minimum essential coverage.  One might argue that it regulates that failure by requiring it to be accompanied by payment of a penalty.  But that failure—that abstention from commerce—is not “Commerce.”  To be sure, purchasing insurance is ”Commerce”; but one does not regulate commerce that does not exist by compelling its existence.\nIn Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1, 196 (1824), Chief Justice Marshall wrote that the power to regulate commerce is the power “to prescribe the rule by which commerce is to be governed.”  That understanding is con- sistent with the original meaning of “regulate” at the time of the Constitution’s ratification, when “to regulate” meant “[t]o adjust by rule, method or established mode,” 2 N. Webster, An American Dictionary of the English Language (1828); “[t]o adjust by rule or method,” 2 S. Johnson, A Dictionary of the English Language (7th ed. 1785); “[t]o adjust, to direct according to rule,” 2 J. Ash, New and Complete Dictionary of the English Language (1775); “to put in order, set to rights, govern or keep in order,” T. Dyche & W. Pardon, A New General English Dictionary\n(16th ed. 1777).1  It can mean to direct the manner of something but not to direct that something come into being.  There is no instance in which this Court or Congress (or anyone else, to our knowledge) has used “regulate” in that peculiar fashion.  If the word bore that meaning, Congress’ authority “[t]o make Rules for the Govern- ment and Regulation of the land and naval Forces,” U. S. Const., Art. I, §8, cl. 14, would have made superfluous the later provision for authority “[t]o raise and support Armies,” id., §8, cl. 12, and “[t]o provide and maintain a Navy,” id., §8, cl. 13.\nWe do not doubt that the buying and selling of health insurance contracts is commerce generally subject to federal regulation.  But when Congress provides that (nearly) all citizens must buy an insurance contract, it goes beyond “adjust[ing] by rule or method,” Johnson, supra, or “direct[ing] according to rule,” Ash, supra; it directs the creation of commerce.\nIn response, the Government offers two theories as to why the Individual Mandate is nevertheless constitutional.  Neither theory suffices to sustain its validity.\nFirst, the Government submits that §5000A is “integral to the Affordable Care Act’s insurance reforms” and “necessary to make effective the Act’s core reforms.”  Brief for Petitioners in No. 11–398 (Minimum Coverage Provision) 24 (hereinafter Petitioners’ Minimum Coverage Brief).  Congress included a “finding” to similar effect in the Act\nitself.  See 42 U. S. C. §18091(2)(H).\nAs discussed in more detail in Part V, infra, the Act contains numerous health insurance reforms, but most notable for present purposes are the “guaranteed issue” and “community rating” provisions, §§300gg to 300gg–4.  The former provides that, with a few exceptions, “each health insurance issuer that offers health insurance coverage in the individual or group market in a State must accept every employer and individual in the State that applies for such coverage.”  §300gg–1(a).  That is, an insurer may not deny coverage on the basis of, among other things, any pre-existing medical condition that the applicant may have, and the resulting insurance must cover that condition.  See §300gg–3.\nUnder ordinary circumstances, of course, insurers would respond by charging high premiums to individuals with pre-existing conditions.  The Act seeks to prevent this through the community-rating provision.  Simply put, the community-rating provision requires insurers to calculate an individual’s insurance premium based on only four factors: (i) whether the individual’s plan covers just the individual or his family also, (ii) the “rating area” in which the individual lives, (iii) the individual’s age, and (iv) whether the individual uses tobacco.  §300gg(a)(1)(A).  Aside from the rough proxies of age and tobacco use (and possibly rating area), the Act does not allow an insurer to factor the individual’s health characteristics into the price of his insurance premium.  This creates a new incentive for young and healthy individuals without pre-existing conditions.  The insurance premiums for those in this group will not reflect their own low actuarial risks but will subsidize insurance for others in the pool.  Many of them may decide that purchasing health insurance is not an eco- nomically sound decision—especially since the guaranteed-issue provision will enable them to purchase it at the same cost in later years and even if they have developed a  pre-existing condition.  But without the contribution of above-risk premiums from the young and healthy, the community-rating provision will not enable insurers to take on high-risk individuals without a massive increase in premiums.\nThe Government presents the Individual Mandate as a unique feature of a complicated regulatory scheme governing many parties with countervailing incentives that must be carefully balanced.  Congress has imposed an extensive set of regulations on the health insurance industry, and compliance with those regulations will likely cost the in- dustry a great deal.  If the industry does not respond by increasing premiums, it is not likely to survive.  And if the industry does increase premiums, then there is a seri- ous risk that its products—insurance plans—will become economically undesirable for many and prohibitively ex- pensive for the rest.\nThis is not a dilemma unique to regulation of the health-insurance industry.  Government regulation typically imposes costs on the regulated industry—especially regulation that prohibits economic behavior in which most market participants are already engaging, such as “piecing out” the market by selling the product to different classes of people at different prices (in the present context, providing much lower insurance rates to young and healthy buyers).  And many industries so regulated face the reality that, without an artificial increase in demand, they cannot continue on.  When Congress is regulating these industries directly, it enjoys the broad power to enact “ ‘all appropriate legislation’ ” to “ ‘protec[t]’ ” and “ ‘advanc[e]’ ” commerce, NLRB v. Jones & Laughlin Steel Corp., 301 U. S. 1, 36–37 (1937) (quoting The Daniel Ball, 10 Wall. 557, 564 (1871)).  Thus, Congress might protect the imperiled industry by prohibiting low-cost competition, or by according it preferential tax treatment, or even by granting it a direct subsidy.\nHere, however, Congress has impressed into service third parties, healthy individuals who could be but are not customers of the relevant industry, to offset the undesirable consequences of the regulation.  Congress’ desire to force these individuals to purchase insurance is motivated by the fact that they are further removed from the market than unhealthy individuals with pre-existing conditions, because they are less likely to need extensive care in the near future.  If Congress can reach out and command even those furthest removed from an interstate market to participate in the market, then the Commerce Clause becomes a font of unlimited power, or in Hamilton’s words, “the hideous monster whose devouring jaws . . . spare neither sex nor age, nor high nor low, nor sacred nor profane.”  The Federalist No. 33, p. 202 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961).\nAt the outer edge of the commerce power, this Court has insisted on careful scrutiny of regulations that do not act directly on an interstate market or its participants.  In New York v. United States, 505 U. S. 144 (1992), we held that Congress could not, in an effort to regulate the disposal of radioactive waste produced in several different industries, order the States to take title to that waste. Id., at 174–177.  In Printz v. United States, 521 U. S. 898 (1997), we held that Congress could not, in an effort to regulate the distribution of firearms in the interstate mar- ket, compel state law-enforcement officials to perform background checks.  Id., at 933–935.  In United States v. Lopez, 514 U. S. 549 (1995), we held that Congress could not, as a means of fostering an educated interstate labor market through the protection of schools, ban the possession of a firearm within a school zone.  Id., at 559–563.  And in United States v. Morrison, 529 U. S. 598 (2000), we held that Congress could not, in an effort to ensure the full participation of women in the interstate economy, subject private individuals and companies to suit for gender-motivated violent torts.  Id., at 609–619.  The lesson of  these cases is that the Commerce Clause, even when sup- plemented by the Necessary and Proper Clause, is not carte blanche for doing whatever will help achieve the ends Congress seeks by the regulation of commerce.  And the last two of these cases show that the scope of the Necessary and Proper Clause is exceeded not only when the congressional action directly violates the sovereignty of the States but also when it violates the background principle of enumerated (and hence limited) federal power.\nThe case upon which the Government principally relies to sustain the Individual Mandate under the Necessary and Proper Clause is Gonzales v. Raich, 545 U. S. 1 (2005).  That case held that Congress could, in an effort to restrain the interstate market in marijuana, ban the local cultivation and possession of that drug.  Id., at 15–22.  Raichis no precedent for what Congress has done here.  That case’s prohibition of growing (cf. Wickard, 317 U. S. 111), and of possession (cf. innumerable federal statutes) did not represent the expansion of the federal power to direct into a broad new field.  The mandating of economic activity does, and since it is a field so limitless that it converts the Commerce Clause into a general authority to direct the economy, that mandating is not “consist[ent] with the letter and spirit of the constitution.”  McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 421 (1819).\nMoreover, Raich is far different from the Individual Mandate in another respect.  The Court’s opinion in Raich pointed out that the growing and possession prohibitions were the only practicable way of enabling the prohibition of interstate traffic in marijuana to be effectively enforced.  545 U. S., at 22.  See also Shreveport Rate Cases, 234 U. S. 342 (1914) (Necessary and Proper Clause allows regulations of intrastate transactions if necessary to the regulation of an interstate market).  Intrastate marijuana could no more be distinguished from interstate marijuana than, for example, endangered-species trophies obtained before  the species was federally protected can be distinguished from trophies obtained afterwards—which made it necessary and proper to prohibit the sale of all such trophies, see Andrus v. Allard, 444 U. S. 51 (1979).\nWith the present statute, by contrast, there are many ways other than this unprecedented Individual Mandate by which the regulatory scheme’s goals of reducing insurance premiums and ensuring the profitability of insurers could be achieved.  For instance, those who did not purchase insurance could be subjected to a surcharge when they do enter the health insurance system.  Or they could be denied a full income tax credit given to those who do purchase the insurance.\nThe Government was invited, at oral argument, to suggest what federal controls over private conduct (other than those explicitly prohibited by the Bill of Rights or other constitutional controls) could not be justified as necessary and proper for the carrying out of a general regulatory scheme.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 27–30, 43–45 (Mar. 27, 2012).  It was unable to name any.  As we said at the outset, whereas the precise scope of the Commerce Clause and the Necessary and Proper Clause is uncertain, the proposition that the Federal Government cannot do everything is a fundamental precept.  See Lopez, 514 U. S., at 564 (“[I]f we were to accept the Government’s arguments, we are hard pressed to posit any activity by an in- dividual that Congress is without power to regulate”).  Section 5000A is defeated by that proposition.\nThe Government’s second theory in support of the In- dividual Mandate is that §5000A is valid because it is actually a “regulat[ion of] activities having a substantial relation to interstate commerce, . . . i.e., . . . activities that substantially affect interstate commerce.”  Id., at 558–559.  See also Shreveport Rate Cases, supra.  This argument  takes a few different forms, but the basic idea is that §5000A regulates “the way in which individuals finance their participation in the health-care market.”  Petitioners’ Minimum Coverage Brief 33 (emphasis added).  That is, the provision directs the manner in which individuals purchase health care services and related goods (directing that they be purchased through insurance) and is therefore a straightforward exercise of the commerce power.\nThe primary problem with this argument is that §5000A does not apply only to persons who purchase all, or most, or even any, of the health care services or goods that the mandated insurance covers.  Indeed, the main objection many have to the Mandate is that they have no intention of purchasing most or even any of such goods or services and thus no need to buy insurance for those purchases.  The Government responds that the health-care market involves “essentially universal participation,” id., at 35.  The principal difficulty with this response is that it is, in the only relevant sense, not true.  It is true enough that everyone consumes “health care,” if the term is taken to include the purchase of a bottle of aspirin.  But the health care “market” that is the object of the Individual Mandate not only includes but principally consists of goods and services that the young people primarily affected by the Mandate do not purchase.  They are quite simply not participants in that market, and cannot be made so (and thereby subjected to regulation) by the simple device of defining participants to include all those who will, later in their lifetime, probably purchase the goods or services covered by the mandated insurance.2  Such a definition of  market participants is unprecedented, and were it to be a premise for the exercise of national power, it would have no principled limits.\nIn a variation on this attempted exercise of federal power, the Government points out that Congress in this Act has purported to regulate “economic and financial decision[s] to forego [sic] health insurance coverage and [to] attempt to self-insure,” 42 U. S. C. §18091(2)(A), since those decisions have “a substantial and deleterious effect on interstate commerce,” Petitioners’ Minimum Coverage Brief 34.  But as the discussion above makes clear, the decision to forgo participation in an interstate market is not itself commercial activity (or indeed any activity at all) within Congress’ power to regulate.  It is true that, at the end of the day, it is inevitable that each American will affect commerce and become a part of it, even if not by choice.  But if every person comes within the Commerce Clause power of Congress to regulate by the simple reason that he will one day engage in commerce, the idea of a limited Government power is at an end.\nWickard v. Filburn has been regarded as the most expansive assertion of the commerce power in our history.  A close second is Perez v. United States, 402 U. S. 146 (1971), which upheld a statute criminalizing the eminently local activity of loan-sharking.  Both of those cases, however,\ninvolved commercial activity.  To go beyond that, and to say that the failure to grow wheat or the refusal to make loans affects commerce, so that growing and lending can be federally compelled, is to extend federal power to virtually everything.  All of us consume food, and when we do so the Federal Government can prescribe what its quality must be and even how much we must pay.  But the mere fact that we all consume food and are thus, sooner or later, participants in the “market” for food, does not empower the Government to say when and what we will buy.  That is essentially what this Act seeks to do with respect to the purchase of health care.  It exceeds federal power.\nA few respectful responses to Justice Ginsburg’s dissent on the issue of the Mandate are in order.  That dissent duly recites the test of Commerce Clause power that our opinions have applied, but disregards the premise the test contains.  It is true enough that Congress needs only a “ ‘rational basis’ for concluding that the regulated activity substantially affects interstate commerce,” ante, at 15 (em- phasis added).  But it must be activity affecting com- merce that is regulated, and not merely the failure to engage in commerce.  And one is not now purchasing the health care covered by the insurance mandate simply because one is likely to be purchasing it in the future.  Our test’s premise of regulated activity is not invented out of whole cloth, but rests upon the Constitution’s requirement that it be commerce which is regulated.  If all inactivity affecting commerce is commerce, commerce is everything.  Ultimately the dissent is driven to saying that there is really no difference between action and inaction, ante, at 26, a proposition that has never recommended itself, neither to the law nor to common sense.  To say, for example, that the inaction here consists of activity in “the self-insurance market,” ibid., seems to us wordplay.  By parity  of reasoning the failure to buy a car can be called participation in the non-private-car-transportation market.  Com- merce becomes everything.\nThe dissent claims that we “fai[l] to explain why the individual mandate threatens our constitutional order.”  Ante, at 35.  But we have done so.  It threatens that order because it gives such an expansive meaning to the Commerce Clause that all private conduct (including failure to act) becomes subject to federal control, effectively destroying the Constitution’s division of governmental powers.  Thus the dissent, on the theories proposed for the validity of the Mandate, would alter the accepted constitutional relation between the individual and the National Government.  The dissent protests that the Necessary and Proper Clause has been held to include “the power to enact criminal laws, . . . the power to imprison, . . . and the power to create a national bank,” ante, at 34–35.  Is not the power to compel purchase of health insurance much lesser?  No, not if (unlike those other dispositions) its application rests upon a theory that everything is within federal control simply because it exists.\nThe dissent’s exposition of the wonderful things the Fed- eral Government has achieved through exercise of its assigned powers, such as “the provision of old-age and survivors’ benefits” in the Social Security Act, ante, at 2, is quite beside the point.  The issue here is whether the federal government can impose the Individual Mandate through the Commerce Clause.  And the relevant history is not that Congress has achieved wide and wonderful results through the proper exercise of its assigned powers in the past, but that it has never before used the Commerce Clause to compel entry into commerce.3  The dissent  treats the Constitution as though it is an enumeration of those problems that the Federal Government can address—among which, it finds, is “the Nation’s course in the economic and social welfare realm,” ibid., and more specifically “the problem of the uninsured,” ante, at 7. The Constitution is not that.  It enumerates not federally soluble problems, but federally available powers.  The Federal Government can address whatever problems it wants but can bring to their solution only those powers that the Constitution confers, among which is the power to regulate commerce.  None of our cases say anything else.  Article I contains no whatever-it-takes-to-solve-a-national-problem power.\nThe dissent dismisses the conclusion that the power to compel entry into the health-insurance market would include the power to compel entry into the new-car or broccoli markets.  The latter purchasers, it says, “will be obliged to pay at the counter before receiving the vehicle  or nourishment,” whereas those refusing to purchase health-insurance will ultimately get treated anyway, at others’ expense.  Ante, at 21.  “[T]he unique attributes of the health-care market . . . give rise to a significant free-riding problem that does not occur in other markets.”  Ante, at 28.  And “a vegetable-purchase mandate” (or a car-purchase mandate) is not “likely to have a substantial effect on the health-care costs” borne by other Americans.  Ante, at 29.  Those differences make a very good argument by the dissent’s own lights, since they show that the failure to purchase health insurance, unlike the failure to purchase cars or broccoli, creates a national, social-welfare problem that is (in the dissent’s view) included among the unenumerated “problems” that the Constitution authorizes the Federal Government to solve.  But those differences do not show that the failure to enter the health-insurance market, unlike the failure to buy cars and broccoli, is an activity that Congress can “regulate.”  (Of course one day the failure of some of the public to purchase Amer- ican cars may endanger the existence of domestic automobile manufacturers; or the failure of some to eat broccoli may be found to deprive them of a newly discovered cancer- fighting chemical which only that food contains, producing health-care costs that are a burden on the rest of us—in which case, under the theory of Justice Ginsburg’s dissent, moving against those inactivities will also come within the Federal Government’s unenumerated problem-solving powers.)\nAs far as §5000A is concerned, we would stop there.  Congress has attempted to regulate beyond the scope of its  Commerce Clause authority,4 and §5000A is therefore invalid.  The Government contends, however, as expressed in the caption to Part II of its brief, that “the minimum coverage provision is independently authorized by congress’s taxing power.”  Petitioners’ Minimum Coverage Brief 52.  The phrase “independently authorized” suggests the existence of a creature never hitherto seen in the United States Reports: A penalty for constitutional purposes that is also a tax for constitutional purposes.  In all our cases the two are mutually exclusive.  The provision challenged under the Constitution is either a penalty or else a tax.  Of course in many cases what was a regu- latory mandate enforced by a penalty could have been imposed as a tax upon permissible action; or what was im- posed as a tax upon permissible action could have been a regulatory mandate enforced by a penalty.  But we know of no case, and the Government cites none, in which the imposition was, for constitutional purposes, both.5  The two are mutually exclusive.  Thus, what the Government’s caption should have read was “alternatively, the minimum coverage provision is not a mandate-with-penalty but a tax.”  It is important to bear this in mind in evaluating the tax argument of the Government and of those who support it: The issue is not whether Congress   had the power to frame the minimum-coverage provision as a tax, but whether it did so.\nIn answering that question we must, if “fairly possible,” Crowell v. Benson, 285 U. S. 22, 62 (1932), construe the provision to be a tax rather than a mandate-with-penalty, since that would render it constitutional rather than un- constitutional (ut res magis valeat quam pereat).  But we cannot rewrite the statute to be what it is not.  “ ‘ “[A]l- though this Court will often strain to construe legis- lation so as to save it against constitutional attack, it must not and will not carry this to the point of perverting the purpose of a statute . . .” or judicially rewriting it.’ ”  Commodity Futures Trading Comm’n v. Schor, 478 U. S. 833, 841 (1986) (quoting Aptheker v. Secretary of State, 378 U. S. 500, 515 (1964), in turn quoting Scales v. United States, 367 U. S. 203, 211 (1961)).  In this case, there is simply no way, “without doing violence to the fair meaning of the words used,” Grenada County Supervisors v. Brogden, 112 U. S. 261, 269 (1884), to escape what Congress enacted: a mandate that individuals maintain minimum essential coverage, enforced by a penalty.\nOur cases establish a clear line between a tax and a penalty: “ ‘[A] tax is an enforced contribution to provide for the support of government; a penalty . . . is an exaction imposed by statute as punishment for an unlawful act.’ ” United States v. Reorganized CF&I Fabricators of Utah, Inc., 518 U. S. 213, 224 (1996) (quoting United States v. La Franca, 282 U. S. 568, 572 (1931)).  In a few cases, this Court has held that a “tax” imposed upon private conduct was so onerous as to be in effect a penalty.  But we have never held—never—that a penalty imposed for violation of the law was so trivial as to be in effect a tax.  We have never held that any exaction imposed for violation of the law is an exercise of Congress’ taxing power—even when the statute calls it a tax, much less when (as here) the statute repeatedly calls it a penalty.  When an act  “adopt[s] the criteria of wrongdoing” and then imposes a monetary penalty as the “principal consequence on those who transgress its standard,” it creates a regulatory penalty, not a tax.  Child Labor Tax Case, 259 U. S. 20, 38 (1922).\nSo the question is, quite simply, whether the exaction here is imposed for violation of the law.  It unquestion- ably is.  The minimum-coverage provision is found in 26 U. S. C. §5000A, entitled “Requirement to maintain minimum essential coverage.” (Emphasis added.)  It commands that every “applicable individual shall . . . ensure that the individual . . . is covered under minimum essential coverage.”  Ibid. (emphasis added).  And the immediately following provision states that, “[i]f . . . an applicable individual . . . fails to meet the requirement of subsection (a) . . . there is hereby imposed . . . a penalty.”  §5000A(b) (emphasis added).  And several of Congress’ legislative “findings” with regard to §5000A confirm that it sets forth a legal requirement and constitutes the assertion of regulatory power, not mere taxing power.  See 42 U. S. C. §18091(2)(A) (“The requirement regulates activity . . .”); §18091(2)(C) (“The requirement . . . will add millions of new consumers to the health insurance market . . .”); §18091(2)(D) (“The requirement achieves near-universal coverage”); §18091(2)(H) (“The requirement is an essential part of this larger regulation of economic activity, and the absence of the requirement would undercut Federal regulation of the health insurance market”); §18091(3) (“[T]he Supreme Court of the United States ruled that insurance is interstate commerce subject to Federal regulation”).\nThe Government and those who support its view on the tax point rely on New York v. United States, 505 U. S. 144, to justify reading “shall” to mean “may.”  The “shall” in that case was contained in an introductory provision—a recital that provided for no legal consequences—which said that “[e]ach State shall be responsible for providing  . . . for the disposal of . . . low-level radioactive waste.”  42 U. S. C. §2021c(a)(1)(A).  The Court did not hold that “shall” could be construed to mean “may,” but rather that this preliminary provision could not impose upon the oper- ative provisions of the Act a mandate that they did not contain: “We . . . decline petitioners’ invitation to con- strue §2021c(a)(1)(A), alone and in isolation, as a command to the States independent of the remainder of the Act.”  New York, 505 U. S., at 170.  Our opinion then proceeded to “consider each [of the three operative provisions] in turn.”  Ibid.  Here the mandate—the “shall”—is contained not in an inoperative preliminary recital, but in the dispositive operative provision itself.  New York provides no support for reading it to be permissive.\nQuite separately, the fact that Congress (in its own words) “imposed . . . a penalty,” 26 U. S. C. §5000A(b)(1), for failure to buy insurance is alone sufficient to render that failure unlawful.  It is one of the canons of interpretation that a statute that penalizes an act makes it unlawful: “[W]here the statute inflicts a penalty for doing an act, although the act itself is not expressly prohibited, yet to do the act is unlawful, because it cannot be supposed that the Legislature intended that a penalty should be inflicted for a lawful act.”  Powhatan Steamboat Co. v. Appomattox R. Co., 24 How. 247, 252 (1861).  Or in the words of Chancellor Kent: “If a statute inflicts a penalty for doing an act, the penalty implies a prohibition, and the thing is unlawful, though there be no prohibitory words in the statute.”  1 J. Kent, Commentaries on American Law 436 (1826).\nWe never have classified as a tax an exaction imposed for violation of the law, and so too, we never have classified as a tax an exaction described in the legislation itself as a penalty.  To be sure, we have sometimes treated as a tax a statutory exaction (imposed for something other than a violation of law) which bore an agnostic label that does not entail the significant constitutional consequences  of a penalty—such as “license” (License Tax Cases, 5 Wall. 462 (1867)) or “surcharge” (New York v. United States, supra.).  But we have never—never—treated as a tax an exaction which faces up to the critical difference between a tax and a penalty, and explicitly denominates the exaction a “penalty.”  Eighteen times in §5000A itself and else- where throughout the Act, Congress called the exaction in §5000A(b) a “penalty.”\nThat §5000A imposes not a simple tax but a mandate to which a penalty is attached is demonstrated by the fact that some are exempt from the tax who are not ex- empt from the mandate—a distinction that would make no sense if the mandate were not a mandate.  Section 5000A(d) exempts three classes of people from the definition of “applicable individual” subject to the minimum coverage requirement: Those with religious objections or who participate in a “health care sharing ministry,” §5000A(d)(2); those who are “not lawfully present” in the United States, §5000A(d)(3); and those who are incarcerated, §5000A(d)(4).  Section 5000A(e) then creates a separate set of exemptions, excusing from liability for the penalty certain individuals who are subject to the minimum coverage requirement: Those who cannot afford coverage, §5000A(e)(1); who earn too little income to require filing a tax return, §5000A(e)(2); who are members of an Indian tribe, §5000A(e)(3); who experience only short gaps in coverage, §5000A(e)(4); and who, in the judgment of the Secretary of Health and Human Services, “have suffered a hardship with respect to the capability to obtain coverage,” §5000A(e)(5).  If §5000A were a tax, these two classes of exemption would make no sense; there being no requirement, all the exemptions would attach to the penalty (renamed tax) alone.\nIn the face of all these indications of a regulatory requirement accompanied by a penalty, the Solicitor General assures us that “neither the Treasury Department nor the  Department of Health and Human Services interprets Section 5000A as imposing a legal obligation,” Petitioners’ Minimum Coverage Brief 61, and that “[i]f [those subject to the Act] pay the tax penalty, they’re in compliance with the law,” Tr. of Oral Arg. 50 (Mar. 26, 2012).  These self-serving litigating positions are entitled to no weight.  What counts is what the statute says, and that is entirely clear.  It is worth noting, moreover, that these assurances contradict the Government’s position in related litigation.  Shortly before the Affordable Care Act was passed, the Commonwealth of Virginia enacted Va. Code Ann. §38.2–3430.1:1 (Lexis Supp. 2011), which states, “No resident of [the] Commonwealth . . . shall be required to obtain or maintain a policy of individual insurance coverage except as required by a court or the Department of Social Services . . . .”  In opposing Virginia’s assertion of standing to challenge §5000A based on this statute, the Government said that “if the minimum coverage provision is unconstitutional, the [Virginia] statute is unnecessary, and if the minimum coverage provision is upheld, the state statute is void under the Supremacy Clause.”  Brief for Appellant in No. 11–1057 etc. (CA4), p. 29.  But it would be void under the Supremacy Clause only if it was contradicted by a federal “require[ment] to obtain or maintain a policy of individual insurance coverage.”\nAgainst the mountain of evidence that the minimum coverage requirement is what the statute calls it—a requirement—and that the penalty for its violation is what the statute calls it—a penalty—the Government brings forward the flimsiest of indications to the contrary.  It notes that “[t]he minimum coverage provision amends the Internal Revenue Code to provide that a non-exempted individual . . . will owe a monetary penalty, in addition to the income tax itself,” and that “[t]he [Internal Revenue Service (IRS)] will assess and collect the penalty in the same manner as assessable penalties under the Internal  Revenue Code.”  Petitioners’ Minimum Coverage Brief 53.  The manner of collection could perhaps suggest a tax if IRS penalty-collection were unheard-of or rare.  It is not.  See, e.g., 26 U. S. C. §527(j) (2006 ed.) (IRS-collectible pen- alty for failure to make campaign-finance disclosures); §5761(c) (IRS-collectible penalty for domestic sales of to- bacco products labeled for export); §9707 (IRS-collectible penalty for failure to make required health-insurance premium payments on behalf of mining employees).  In Reorganized CF&I Fabricators of Utah, Inc., 518 U. S. 213, we held that an exaction not only enforced by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue but even called a “tax” was in fact a penalty.  “[I]f the concept of penalty means anything,” we said, “it means punishment for an unlawful act or omission.”  Id., at 224.  See also Lipke v. Lederer, 259 U. S. 557 (1922) (same).  Moreover, while the penalty is assessed and collected by the IRS, §5000A is administered both by that agency and by the Department of Health and Human Services (and also the Secretary of Veteran Affairs), see §5000A(e)(1)(D), (e)(5), (f)(1)(A)(v), (f)(1)(E) (2006 ed., Supp. IV), which is responsible for defining its substantive scope—a feature that would be quite extraordinary for taxes.\nThe Government points out that “[t]he amount of the penalty will be calculated as a percentage of household income for federal income tax purposes, subject to a floor and [a] ca[p],” and that individuals who earn so little money that they “are not required to file income tax returns for the taxable year are not subject to the penalty” (though they are, as we discussed earlier, subject to the mandate).  Petitioners’ Minimum Coverage Brief 12, 53.  But varying a penalty according to ability to pay is an utterly familiar practice.  See, e.g., 33 U. S. C. §1319(d) (2006 ed., Supp. IV) (“In determining the amount of a civil penalty the court shall consider . . . the economic impact of the penalty on the violator”); see also 6 U. S. C. §488e(c); 7  U. S. C. §§7734(b)(2), 8313(b)(2); 12 U. S. C. §§1701q–1(d)(3), 1723i(c)(3), 1735f–14(c)(3), 1735f–15(d)(3), 4585(c)(2); 15 U. S. C. §§45(m)(1)(C), 77h–1(g)(3), 78u–2(d), 80a–9(d)(4), 80b–3(i)(4), 1681s(a)(2)(B), 1717a(b)(3), 1825(b)(1), 2615(a) (2)(B), 5408(b)(2); 33 U. S. C. §2716a(a).\nThe last of the feeble arguments in favor of petition- ers that we will address is the contention that what this statute repeatedly calls a penalty is in fact a tax because it contains no scienter requirement.  The presence of such a requirement suggests a penalty—though one can imagine a tax imposed only on willful action; but the absence of such a requirement does not suggest a tax.  Penalties for absolute-liability offenses are commonplace.  And where a statute is silent as to scienter, we traditionally presume a mens rea requirement if the statute imposes a “severe penalty.”  Staples v. United States, 511 U. S. 600, 618 (1994).  Since we have an entire jurisprudence addressing when it is that a scienter requirement should be inferred from a penalty, it is quite illogical to suggest that a penalty is not a penalty for want of an express scienter requirement.\nAnd the nail in the coffin is that the mandate and penalty are located in Title I of the Act, its operative core, rather than where a tax would be found—in Title IX, containing the Act’s “Revenue Provisions.”  In sum, “the terms of [the] act rende[r] it unavoidable,” Parsons v. Bedford, 3 Pet. 433, 448 (1830), that Congress imposed a regulatory penalty, not a tax.\nFor all these reasons, to say that the Individual Mandate merely imposes a tax is not to interpret the statute but to rewrite it.  Judicial tax-writing is particularly troubl- ing.  Taxes have never been popular, see, e.g., Stamp Act of 1765, and in part for that reason, the Constitution requires tax increases to originate in the House of Representatives.  See Art. I, §7, cl. 1.  That is to say, they must originate in the legislative body most accountable to the  people, where legislators must weigh the need for the tax against the terrible price they might pay at their next election, which is never more than two years off.  The Federalist No. 58 “defend[ed] the decision to give the origination power to the House on the ground that the Chamber that is more accountable to the people should have the primary role in raising revenue.”  United States v. Munoz-Flores, 495 U. S. 385, 395 (1990).  We have no doubt that Congress knew precisely what it was doing when it rejected an earlier version of this legislation that imposed a tax instead of a requirement-with-penalty.  See Affordable Health Care for America Act, H. R. 3962, 111th Cong., 1st Sess., §501 (2009); America’s Healthy Future Act of 2009, S. 1796, 111th Cong., 1st Sess., §1301.  Imposing a tax through judicial legislation inverts the constitutional scheme, and places the power to tax in the branch of government least accountable to the citizenry.\nFinally, we must observe that rewriting §5000A as a tax in order to sustain its constitutionality would force us to confront a difficult constitutional question: whether this is a direct tax that must be apportioned among the States according to their population.  Art. I, §9, cl. 4.  Perhaps it is not (we have no need to address the point); but the meaning of the Direct Tax Clause is famously unclear, and its application here is a question of first impression that deserves more thoughtful consideration than the lick-and-a-promise accorded by the Government and its supporters.  The Government’s opening brief did not even address the question—perhaps because, until today, no federal court has accepted the implausible argument that §5000A is an exercise of the tax power.  And once respondents raised the issue, the Government devoted a mere 21 lines of its reply brief to the issue.  Petitioners’ Minimum Coverage Reply Brief 25.  At oral argument, the most prolonged statement about the issue was just over 50 words.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 79 (Mar. 27, 2012).  One would expect this Court  to demand more than fly-by-night briefing and argument before deciding a difficult constitutional question of first impression.\nThere is another point related to the Individual Mandate that we must discuss—a point that logically should have been discussed first: Whether jurisdiction over the challenges to the minimum-coverage provision is precluded by the Anti-Injunction Act, which provides that “no suit for the purpose of restraining the assessment or collection of any tax shall be maintained in any court by any person,” 26 U. S. C. §7421(a) (2006 ed.).\nWe have left the question to this point because it seemed to us that the dispositive question whether the minimum-coverage provision is a tax is more appropriately addressed in the significant constitutional context of whether it is an exercise of Congress’ taxing power.  Having found that it is not, we have no difficulty in deciding that these suits do not have “the purpose of restraining the assessment or collection of any tax.”6\nThe Government and those who support its position on this point make the remarkable argument that §5000A is not a tax for purposes of the Anti-Injunction Act, see Brief for Petitioners in No. 11–398 (Anti-Injunction Act), but is a tax for constitutional purposes, see Petitioners’ Minimum Coverage Brief 52–62.  The rhetorical device that tries to cloak this argument in superficial plausibility is the same device employed in arguing that for constitutional purposes the minimum-coverage provision is a tax: confusing the question of what Congress did with the question of what Congress could have done.  What qualifies as a tax for purposes of the Anti-Injunction Act, unlike what qualifies as a tax for purposes of the Constitution, is entirely within the control of Congress.  Compare Bailey v. George, 259 U. S. 16, 20 (1922) (Anti-Injunction Act barred suit to restrain collections under the Child Labor Tax Law), with Child Labor Tax Case, 259 U. S., at 36–41 (holding the same law unconstitutional as exceeding Congress’ taxing power).  Congress could have defined “tax” for purposes of that statute in such fashion as to exclude some exactions that in fact are “taxes.”  It might have prescribed, for example, that a particular exercise of the taxing power “shall not be regarded as a tax for purposes of the Anti-Injunction Act.”  But there is no such prescription here.  What the Government would have us believe in   these cases is that the very same textual indications that show this is not a tax under the Anti-Injunction Act show that it is a tax under the Constitution.  That carries ver- bal wizardry too far, deep into the forbidden land of the sophists.\nWe now consider respondents’ second challenge to the constitutionality of the ACA, namely, that the Act’s dramatic expansion of the Medicaid program exceeds Congress’ power to attach conditions to federal grants to the States.\nThe ACA does not legally compel the States to participate in the expanded Medicaid program, but the Act authorizes a severe sanction for any State that refuses to go along: termination of all the State’s Medicaid funding.  For the average State, the annual federal Medicaid subsidy is equal to more than one-fifth of the State’s expenditures.7  A State forced out of the program would not only lose this huge sum but would almost certainly find it necessary to increase its own health-care expenditures substantially, requiring either a drastic reduction in funding for other programs or a large increase in state taxes.  And these new taxes would come on top of the federal taxes already paid by the State’s citizens to fund the Medicaid program in other States.\nThe States challenging the constitutionality of the ACA’s Medicaid Expansion contend that, for these practical reasons, the Act really does not give them any choice at all.  As proof of this, they point to the goal and the struc-   ture of the ACA.  The goal of the Act is to provide near-universal medical coverage, 42 U. S. C. §18091(2)(D), and without 100% State participation in the Medicaid program, attainment of this goal would be thwarted.  Even if States could elect to remain in the old Medicaid program, while declining to participate in the Expansion, there would be a gaping hole in coverage.  And if a substantial number of States were entirely expelled from the program, the number of persons without coverage would be even higher.\nIn light of the ACA’s goal of near-universal coverage, petitioners argue, if Congress had thought that anything less than 100% state participation was a realistic possibility, Congress would have provided a backup scheme.  But no such scheme is to be found anywhere in the more than 900 pages of the Act.  This shows, they maintain, that Congress was certain that the ACA’s Medicaid offer was one that no State could refuse.\nIn response to this argument, the Government contends that any congressional assumption about uniform state participation was based on the simple fact that the offer of federal funds associated with the expanded coverage is such a generous gift that no State would want to turn it down.\nTo evaluate these arguments, we consider the extent of the Federal Government’s power to spend money and to attach conditions to money granted to the States.\nNo one has ever doubted that the Constitution authorizes the Federal Government to spend money, but for many years the scope of this power was unsettled.  The Constitution grants Congress the power to collect taxes “to . . . provide for the . . . general Welfare of the United States,” Art. I, §8, cl. 1, and from “the foundation of the Nation sharp differences of opinion have persisted as to  the true interpretation of the phrase” “the general welfare.”  Butler, 297 U. S., at 65.  Madison, it has been said, thought that the phrase “amounted to no more than a reference to the other powers enumerated in the subsequent clauses of the same section,” while Hamilton “maintained the clause confers a power separate and distinct from those later enumerated [and] is not restricted in meaning by the grant of them.”  Ibid.\nThe Court resolved this dispute in Butler.  Writing for the Court, Justice Roberts opined that the Madisonian view would make Article I’s grant of the spending power a “mere tautology.”  Ibid.  To avoid that, he adopted Hamilton’s approach and found that “the power of Congress to authorize expenditure of public moneys for public purposes is not limited by the direct grants of legislative power found in the Constitution.”  Id., at 66.  Instead, he wrote, the spending power’s “confines are set in the clause which confers it, and not in those of section 8 which bestow and define the legislative powers of the Congress.”  Ibid.; see also Steward Machine Co. v. Davis, 301 U. S. 548, 586–587 (1937); Helvering v. Davis, 301 U. S. 619, 640 (1937).\nThe power to make any expenditure that furthers “the general welfare” is obviously very broad, and shortly after Butler was decided the Court gave Congress wide leeway to decide whether an expenditure qualifies.  See Helvering, 301 U. S., at 640–641.  “The discretion belongs to Congress,” the Court wrote, “unless the choice is clearly wrong, a display of arbitrary power, not an exercise of judgment.”  Id., at 640.  Since that time, the Court has never held that a federal expenditure was not for “the general welfare.”\nOne way in which Congress may spend to promote the general welfare is by making grants to the States.  Mone tary grants, so-called grants-in-aid, became more frequent during the 1930’s, G. Stephens & N. Wikstrom, Ameri- can Intergovernmental Relations—A Fragmented Federal Polity 83 (2007), and by 1950 they had reached $20 billion8 or 11.6% of state and local government expenditures from their own sources.9  By 1970 this number had grown to $123.7 billion10 or 29.1% of state and local government expenditures from their own sources.11  As of 2010, fed- eral outlays to state and local governments came to over $608 billion or 37.5% of state and local government expenditures.12\nWhen Congress makes grants to the States, it customarily attaches conditions, and this Court has long held that the Constitution generally permits Congress to do this.  See Pennhurst State School and Hospital v. Halderman, 451 U. S. 1, 17 (1981); South Dakota v. Dole, 483 U. S. 203, 206 (1987); Fullilove v. Klutznick, 448 U. S. 448, 474 (1980) (opinion of Burger, C. J.); Steward Machine, supra, at 593.\nThis practice of attaching conditions to federal funds   greatly increases federal power.  “[O]bjectives not thought to be within Article I’s enumerated legislative fields, may nevertheless be attained through the use of the spending power and the conditional grant of federal funds.”  Dole, supra, at 207 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted); see also College Savings Bank v. Florida Prepaid Postsecondary Ed. Expense Bd., 527 U. S. 666, 686 (1999) (by attaching conditions to federal funds, Congress may induce the States to “tak[e] certain actions that Congress could not require them to take”).\nThis formidable power, if not checked in any way, would present a grave threat to the system of federalism created by our Constitution.  If Congress’ “Spending Clause power to pursue objectives outside of Article I’s enumerated legislative fields,” Davis v. Monroe County Bd. of Ed., 526 U. S. 629, 654 (1999) (Kennedy, J., dissenting) (internal quotation marks omitted), is “limited only by Congress’ notion of the general welfare, the reality, given the vast financial resources of the Federal Government, is that the Spending Clause gives ‘power to the Congress to tear down the barriers, to invade the states’ jurisdiction, and to become a parliament of the whole people, subject to no restrictions save such as are self-imposed,’ ” Dole, supra, at 217 (O’Connor, J., dissenting) (quoting Butler, 297 U. S., at 78).  “[T]he Spending Clause power, if wielded without concern for the federal balance, has the potential to obliterate distinctions between national and local spheres of interest and power by permitting the Federal Government to set policy in the most sensitive areas of traditional state concern, areas which otherwise would lie outside its reach.”  Davis, supra, at 654–655 (Kennedy, J., dissenting).\nRecognizing this potential for abuse, our cases have long held that the power to attach conditions to grants to the States has limits.  See, e.g., Dole, supra, at 207–208; id., at 207 (spending power is “subject to several general re-  strictions articulated in our cases”).  For one thing, any such conditions must be unambiguous so that a State at least knows what it is getting into.  See Pennhurst, supra, at 17.  Conditions must also be related “to the federal interest in particular national projects or programs,” Massachusetts v. United States, 435 U. S. 444, 461 (1978), and the conditional grant of federal funds may not “induce the States to engage in activities that would themselves be unconstitutional,” Dole, supra, at 210; see Lawrence County v. Lead-Deadwood School Dist. No. 40–1, 469 U. S. 256, 269–270 (1985).  Finally, while Congress may seek to induce States to accept conditional grants, Congress may not cross the “point at which pressure turns into compulsion, and ceases to be inducement.”  Steward Machine, 301 U. S., at 590.  Accord, College Savings Bank, supra, at 687; Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority v. Citizens for Abatement of Aircraft Noise, Inc., 501 U. S. 252, 285 (1991) (White, J., dissenting); Dole, supra, at 211.\nWhen federal legislation gives the States a real choice whether to accept or decline a federal aid package, the federal-state relationship is in the nature of a contractual relationship.  See Barnes v. Gorman, 536 U. S. 181, 186 (2002); Pennhurst, 451 U. S., at 17.  And just as a contract is voidable if coerced, “[t]he legitimacy of Congress’ power to legislate under the spending power . . . rests on whether the State voluntarily and knowingly accepts the terms of the ‘contract.’ ”  Ibid.  (emphasis added).  If a federal spending program coerces participation the States have not “exercise[d] their choice”—let alone made an “informed choice.”  Id., at 17, 25.\nCoercing States to accept conditions risks the destruction of the “unique role of the States in our system.”   Davis, supra, at 685 (Kennedy, J., dissenting).  “[T]he Constitution has never been understood to confer upon Congress the ability to require the States to govern according to Congress’ instructions.”  New York, 505 U. S., at  162.  Congress may not “simply commandeer the legislative processes of the States by directly compelling them to enact and enforce a federal regulatory program.”  Id., at 161 (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted).  Congress effectively engages in this impermissible compulsion when state participation in a federal spending program is coerced, so that the States’ choice whether to enact or administer a federal regulatory program is rendered illusory.\nWhere all Congress has done is to “encourag[e] state regulation rather than compe[l] it, state governments remain responsive to the local electorate’s preferences; state officials remain accountable to the people.  [But] where the Federal Government compels States to regulate, the accountability of both state and federal officials is diminished.”  New York, supra, at 168.\nAmici who support the Government argue that forcing state employees to implement a federal program is more respectful of federalism than using federal workers to implement that program.  See, e.g., Brief for Service Employees International Union et al. as Amici Curiae in No. 11–398, pp. 25–26.  They note that Congress, instead of expanding Medicaid, could have established an entirely federal program to provide coverage for the same group of people.  By choosing to structure Medicaid as a cooperative federal-state program, they contend, Congress allows for more state control.  Ibid.\nThis argument reflects a view of federalism that our cases have rejected—and with good reason.  When Congress compels the States to do its bidding, it blurs the lines of political accountability.  If the Federal Government makes a controversial decision while acting on its own, “it is the Federal Government that makes the decision in full view of the public, and it will be federal officials that suffer the consequences if the decision turns out to be detrimental or unpopular.”  New York, 505 U. S., at  168.  But when the Federal Government compels the States to take unpopular actions, “it may be state officials who will bear the brunt of public disapproval, while the federal officials who devised the regulatory program may remain insulated from the electoral ramifications of their decision.”  Id., at 169; see Printz, supra, at 930.  For this reason, federal officeholders may view this “departur[e] from the federal structure to be in their personal interests . . . as a means of shifting responsibility for the eventual decision.”  New York, 505 U. S., at 182–183.  And even state officials may favor such a “departure from the constitutional plan,” since uncertainty concerning responsibility may also permit them to escape accountability.  Id., at 182.  If a program is popular, state officials may claim credit; if it is unpopular, they may protest that they were merely responding to a federal directive.\nOnce it is recognized that spending-power legislation cannot coerce state participation, two questions remain: (1) What is the meaning of coercion in this context?  (2) Is the ACA’s expanded Medicaid coverage coercive?  We now turn to those questions.\nThe answer to the first of these questions—the meaning of coercion in the present context—is straightforward.  As we have explained, the legitimacy of attaching conditions to federal grants to the States depends on the voluntariness of the States’ choice to accept or decline the offered package.  Therefore, if States really have no choice other than to accept the package, the offer is coercive, and the conditions cannot be sustained under the spending power.  And as our decision in South Dakota v. Dole makes clear, theoretical voluntariness is not enough.\nIn South Dakota v. Dole, we considered whether the spending power permitted Congress to condition 5% of the  State’s federal highway funds on the State’s adoption of a minimum drinking age of 21 years.  South Dakota argued that the program was impermissibly coercive, but we disagreed, reasoning that “Congress ha[d] directed only that a State desiring to establish a minimum drinking age lower than 21 lose a relatively small percentage of certain federal highway funds.”  483 U. S., at 211. Because “all South Dakota would lose if she adhere[d] to her chosen course as to a suitable minimum drinking age [was] 5% of the funds otherwise obtainable under specified high- way grant programs,” we found that “Congress ha[d] of- fered relatively mild encouragement to the States to enact higher minimum drinking ages than they would otherwise choose.”  Ibid.  Thus, the decision whether to comply with the federal condition “remain[ed] the prerogative of the States not merely in theory but in fact,” and so the program at issue did not exceed Congress’ power.  Id., at 211–212 (emphasis added).\nThe question whether a law enacted under the spending power is coercive in fact will sometimes be difficult, but where Congress has plainly “crossed the line distinguishing encouragement from coercion,” New York, supra, at 175, a federal program that coopts the States’ political processes must be declared unconstitutional.  “[T]he federal balance is too essential a part of our constitutional structure and plays too vital a role in securing freedom for us to admit inability to intervene.”  Lopez, 514 U. S., at 578 (Kennedy, J., concurring).\nThe Federal Government’s argument in this case at best pays lip service to the anticoercion principle.  The Federal Government suggests that it is sufficient if States are “free, as a matter of law, to turn down” federal funds.  Brief for Respondents in No. 11–400, p. 17 (emphasis added); see also id., at 25.  According to the Federal Gov ernment, neither the amount of the offered federal funds nor the amount of the federal taxes extracted from the taxpayers of a State to pay for the program in question is relevant in determining whether there is impermissible coercion.  Id., at 41–46.\nThis argument ignores reality.  When a heavy federal tax is levied to support a federal program that offers large grants to the States, States may, as a practical matter, be unable to refuse to participate in the federal program and to substitute a state alternative.  Even if a State believes that the federal program is ineffective and inefficient, withdrawal would likely force the State to impose a huge tax increase on its residents, and this new state tax would come on top of the federal taxes already paid by residents to support subsidies to participating States.13\nAcceptance of the Federal Government’s interpreta- tion of the anticoercion rule would permit Congress to dic- tate policy in areas traditionally governed primarily at the state or local level.  Suppose, for example, that Congress enacted legislation offering each State a grant equal to the State’s entire annual expenditures for primary and secondary education.  Suppose also that this funding came with conditions governing such things as school curriculum, the hiring and tenure of teachers, the drawing of school districts, the length and hours of the school day, the   school calendar, a dress code for students, and rules for student discipline.  As a matter of law, a State could turn down that offer, but if it did so, its residents would not only be required to pay the federal taxes needed to support this expensive new program, but they would also be forced to pay an equivalent amount in state taxes.  And if the State gave in to the federal law, the State and its subdivisions would surrender their traditional authority in the field of education.  Asked at oral argument whether such a law would be allowed under the spending power, the Solicitor General responded that it would.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 44–45 (Mar. 28, 2012).\nWhether federal spending legislation crosses the line from enticement to coercion is often difficult to determine, and courts should not conclude that legislation is unconstitutional on this ground unless the coercive nature of an offer is unmistakably clear.  In this case, however, there can be no doubt.  In structuring the ACA, Congress unambiguously signaled its belief that every State would have no real choice but to go along with the Medicaid Expansion.  If the anticoercion rule does not apply in this case, then there is no such rule.\nThe dimensions of the Medicaid program lend strong support to the petitioner States’ argument that refusing to accede to the conditions set out in the ACA is not a realistic option.  Before the ACA’s enactment, Medicaid funded medical care for pregnant women, families with dependents, children, the blind, the elderly, and the disabled.  See 42 U. S. C. §1396a(a)(10) (2006 ed., Supp. IV).  The ACA greatly expands the program’s reach, making new funds available to States that agree to extend coverage to all individuals who are under age 65 and have incomes below  133% of the federal poverty line.  See  §1396a(a) (10)(A)(i)(VIII).  Any State that refuses to expand its Medicaid programs in this way is threatened with a severe sanction: the loss of all its federal Medicaid funds.  See §1396c (2006 ed.).\nMedicaid has long been the largest federal program of grants to the States.  See Brief for Respondents in No. 11–400, at 37.  In 2010, the Federal Government directed more than $552 billion in federal funds to the States.  See Nat. Assn. of State Budget Officers, 2010 State Expenditure Report: Examining Fiscal 2009–2011 State Spending, p. 7 (2011) (NASBO Report).  Of this, more than $233 billion went to pre-expansion Medicaid.  See id., at 47.14 This amount equals nearly 22% of all state expenditures combined.  See id., at 7.\nThe States devote a larger percentage of their budgets to Medicaid than to any other item.  Id., at 5.  Federal funds account for anywhere from 50% to 83% of each State’s total Medicaid expenditures, see §1396d(b) (2006 ed., Supp. IV); most States receive more than $1 billion in federal Medicaid funding; and a quarter receive more than   $5 billion, NASBO Report 47.  These federal dollars total nearly two thirds—64.6%—of all Medicaid expenditures nationwide.15 Id., at 46.\nThe Court of Appeals concluded that the States failed to establish coercion in this case in part because the “states have the power to tax and raise revenue, and therefore can create and fund programs of their own if they do not like Congress’s terms.”  648 F. 3d 1235, 1268 (CA11 2011); see Brief for Sen. Harry Reid et al. as Amici Curiae in No. 11–400, p. 21 (“States may always choose to decrease expenditures on other programs or to raise revenues”).  But the sheer size of this federal spending program in relation to state expenditures means that a State would be very hard pressed to compensate for the loss of federal funds by cutting other spending or raising additional revenue.  Arizona, for example, commits 12% of its state expenditures to Medicaid, and relies on the Federal Government to provide the rest: $5.6 billion, equaling roughly one-third of Arizona’s annual state expenditures of $17 billion.  See NASBO Report 7, 47.  Therefore, if Arizona lost federal Medicaid funding, the State would have to commit an additional 33% of all its state expenditures to fund an equivalent state program along the lines of pre-expansion Medicaid.  This means that the State would have to allocate 45% of its annual expenditures for that one purpose.  See ibid.\nThe States are far less reliant on federal funding for any other program.  After Medicaid, the next biggest federal   funding item is aid to support elementary and secondary education, which amounts to 12.8% of total federal outlays to the States, see id., at 7, 16, and equals only 6.6% of all state expenditures combined.  See ibid.  In Arizona, for example, although federal Medicaid expenditures are equal to 33% of all state expenditures, federal education funds amount to only 9.8% of all state expenditures.  See ibid.  And even in States with less than average federal Medicaid funding, that funding is at least twice the size of federal education funding as a percentage of state expenditures.  Id., at 7, 16, 47.\nA State forced out of the Medicaid program would face burdens in addition to the loss of federal Medicaid funding.  For example, a nonparticipating State might be found to be ineligible for other major federal funding sources, such as Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), which is premised on the expectation that States will participate in Medicaid.  See 42 U. S. C. §602(a)(3) (2006 ed.) (requiring that certain beneficiaries of TANF funds be “eligible for medical assistance under the State[’s Medicaid] plan”).  And withdrawal or expulsion from the Medicaid program would not relieve a State’s hospitals of their obligation under federal law to provide care for patients who are unable to pay for medical services.  The Emer- gency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act, §1395dd, requires hospitals that receive any federal funding to provide stabilization care for indigent patients but does not offer federal funding to assist facilities in carrying out its mandate.  Many of these patients are now covered by Medicaid.  If providers could not look to the Medicaid program to pay for this care, they would find it exceed- ingly difficult to comply with federal law unless they were given substantial state support.  See, e.g., Brief for Economists as Amici Curiae in No 11–400, p. 11.\nFor these reasons, the offer that the ACA makes to the States—go along with a dramatic expansion of Medicaid or  potentially lose all federal Medicaid funding—is quite unlike anything that we have seen in a prior spending-power case.  In South Dakota v. Dole, the total amount that the States would have lost if every single State had refused to comply with the 21-year-old drinking age was approximately $614.7 million—or about 0.19% of all state expenditures combined.  See Nat. Assn. of State Budget Officers, 1989 (Fiscal Years 1987– 1989 Data) State Expenditure Report 10, 84 (1989), http://www.nasbo.org/publications-data/state-expenditure-report/archives.  South Dakota stood to lose, at most, funding that amounted to less than 1% of its annual state expenditures.  See ibid.  Under the ACA, by contrast, the Federal Government has threatened to withhold 42.3% of all federal outlays to the states, or approximately $233 billion.  See NASBO Report 7, 10, 47.  South Dakota stands to lose federal funding equaling 28.9% of its annual state expenditures.  See id., at 7, 47.  Withholding $614.7 million, equaling only 0.19% of all state expenditures combined, is aptly characterized as “relatively mild encouragement,” but threatening to withhold $233 billion, equaling 21.86% of all state expenditures combined, is a different matter.\nWhat the statistics suggest is confirmed by the goal and structure of the ACA.  In crafting the ACA, Congress clearly expressed its informed view that no State could possibly refuse the offer that the ACA extends.\nThe stated goal of the ACA is near-universal health care coverage.  To achieve this goal, the ACA mandates that every person obtain a minimum level of coverage.  It attempts to reach this goal in several different ways.  The guaranteed issue and community-rating provisions are designed to make qualifying insurance available and affordable for persons with medical conditions that may  require expensive care.  Other ACA provisions seek to make such policies more affordable for people of modest means.  Finally, for low-income individuals who are simply not able to obtain insurance, Congress expanded Medicaid, transforming it from a program covering only members of a limited list of vulnerable groups into a program that provides at least the requisite minimum level of coverage for the poor.  See 42 U. S. C. §§1396a(a) (10)(A)(i)(VIII) (2006 ed., Supp. IV), 1396u–7(a), (b)(5), 18022(a).  This design was intended to provide at least a specified minimum level of coverage for all Americans, but the achievement of that goal obviously depends on participation by every single State.  If any State—not to mention all of the 26 States that brought this suit—chose to decline the federal offer, there would be a gaping hole in the ACA’s coverage.\nIt is true that some persons who are eligible for Medicaid coverage under the ACA may be able to secure private insurance, either through their employers or by obtain- ing subsidized insurance through an exchange.  See 26 U. S. C. §36B(a) (2006 ed., Supp. IV); Brief for Respondents in No. 11–400, at 12.  But the new federal subsidies are not available to those whose income is below the federal poverty level, and the ACA provides no means, other than Medicaid, for these individuals to obtain coverage and comply with the Mandate.  The Government counters that these people will not have to pay the penalty, see, e.g., Tr. of Oral Arg. 68 (Mar. 28, 2012); Brief for Respondents in No. 11–400, at 49–50, but that argument misses the point:  Without Medicaid, these individuals will not have coverage and the ACA’s goal of near-universal coverage will be severely frustrated.\nIf Congress had thought that States might actually refuse to go along with the expansion of Medicaid, Congress would surely have devised a backup scheme so that the most vulnerable groups in our society, those previously  eligible for Medicaid, would not be left out in the cold.  But nowhere in the over 900-page Act is such a scheme to be found.  By contrast, because Congress thought that some States might decline federal funding for the operation of a “health benefit exchange,” Congress provided a backup scheme; if a State declines to participate in the operation of an exchange, the Federal Government will step in and operate an exchange in that State.  See 42 U. S. C. §18041(c)(1).  Likewise, knowing that States would not necessarily provide affordable health insurance for aliens lawfully present in the United States—because Medicaid does not require States to provide such coverage—Con- gress extended the availability of the new federal insurance subsidies to all aliens.  See 26 U. S. C. §36B(c) (1)(B)(ii) (excepting from the income limit individuals who are “not eligible for the medicaid program . . . by reason of [their] alien status”).  Congress did not make these subsidies available for citizens with incomes below the poverty level because Congress obviously assumed that they would be covered by Medicaid.  If Congress had contemplated that some of these citizens would be left without Medicaid coverage as a result of a State’s withdrawal or expulsion from the program, Congress surely would have made them eligible for the tax subsidies provided for low-income aliens.\nThese features of the ACA convey an unmistakable message: Congress never dreamed that any State would refuse to go along with the expansion of Medicaid.  Congress well understood that refusal was not a practical option.\nThe Federal Government does not dispute the inference that Congress anticipated 100% state participation, but it argues that this assumption was based on the fact that ACA’s offer was an “exceedingly generous” gift.  Brief for Respondents in No. 11–400, at 50.  As the Federal Government sees things, Congress is like the generous bene factor who offers $1 million with few strings attached to 50 randomly selected individuals.  Just as this benefactor might assume that all of these 50 individuals would snap up his offer, so Congress assumed that every State would gratefully accept the federal funds (and conditions) to go with the expansion of Medicaid.\nThis characterization of the ACA’s offer raises obvious questions.  If that offer is “exceedingly generous,” as the Federal Government maintains, why have more than half the States brought this lawsuit, contending that the offer is coercive?  And why did Congress find it necessary to threaten that any State refusing to accept this “exceed- ingly generous” gift would risk losing all Medicaid funds?  Congress could have made just the new funding provided under the ACA contingent on acceptance of the terms of the Medicaid Expansion.  Congress took such an approach in some earlier amendments to Medicaid, separating new coverage requirements and funding from the rest of the program so that only new funding was conditioned on new eligibility extensions.  See, e.g., Social Security Amendments of 1972, 86 Stat. 1465.\nCongress’ decision to do otherwise here reflects its understanding that the ACA offer is not an “exceedingly generous” gift that no State in its right mind would decline.  Instead, acceptance of the offer will impose very substantial costs on participating States.  It is true that the Federal Government will bear most of the initial costs associated with the Medicaid Expansion, first paying 100% of the costs of covering newly eligible individuals between 2014 and 2016.  42 U. S. C. §1396d(y).  But that is just part of the picture.  Participating States will be forced to shoulder substantial costs as well, because after 2019 the Federal Government will cover only 90% of the costs associated with the Expansion, see ibid., with state spending projected to increase by at least $20 billion by 2020 as a consequence.  Statement of Douglas W. Elmen dorf, CBO’s Analysis of the Major Health Care Legislation Enacted in March 2010, p. 24 (Mar. 30, 2011); see also R. Bovbjerg, B. Ormond, & V. Chen, Kaiser Commission on Medicaid and the Uninsured, State Budgets under Federal Health Reform: The Extent and Causes of Variations in Estimated Impacts 4, n. 27 (Feb. 2011) (estimating new state spending at $43.2 billion through 2019).  After 2019, state spending is expected to increase at a faster rate; the CBO estimates new state spending at $60 billion through 2021.  Statement of Douglas W. Elmendorf, supra, at 24.  And these costs may increase in the future because of the very real possibility that the Federal Government will change funding terms and reduce the percentage of funds it will cover.  This would leave the States to bear an increasingly large percentage of the bill.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 74–76 (Mar. 28, 2012).  Finally, after 2015, the States will have to pick up the tab for 50% of all administrative costs associated with implementing the new program, see §§1396b(a)(2)–(5), (7) (2006 ed., Supp. IV), costs that could approach $12 billion between fiscal years 2014 and 2020, see Dept. of Health and Human Services, Center for Medicaid and Medicare Services, 2010 Actuarial Report on the Financial Outlook for Medicaid 30.\nIn sum, it is perfectly clear from the goal and structure of the ACA that the offer of the Medicaid Expansion was one that Congress understood no State could refuse. The Medicaid Expansion therefore exceeds Congress’ spending power and cannot be implemented.\nSeven Members of the Court agree that the Medicaid Expansion, as enacted by Congress, is unconstitutional.  See Part IV–A to IV–E, supra; Part IV–A, ante, at 45–55 (opinion of Roberts, C. J., joined by Breyer and Kagan, JJ.).  Because the Medicaid Expansion is unconstitutional, the question of remedy arises.  The most natural remedy  would be to invalidate the Medicaid Expansion.  However, the Government proposes—in two cursory sentences at the very end of its brief—preserving the Expansion.  Under its proposal, States would receive the additional Medi- caid funds if they expand eligibility, but States would keep their pre-existing Medicaid funds if they do not expand eligibility.  We cannot accept the Government’s suggestion.\nThe reality that States were given no real choice but to expand Medicaid was not an accident.  Congress assumed States would have no choice, and the ACA depends on States’ having no choice, because its Mandate requires low-income individuals to obtain insurance many of them can afford only through the Medicaid Expansion.  Furthermore, a State’s withdrawal might subject everyone in the State to much higher insurance premiums.  That is because the Medicaid Expansion will no longer offset the cost to the insurance industry imposed by the ACA’s insurance regulations and taxes, a point that is explained in more detail in the severability section below.  To make the Medicaid Expansion optional despite the ACA’s structure and design “ ‘would be to make a new law, not to enforce an old one.  This is no part of our duty.’ ”  Trade-Mark Cases, 100 U. S. 82, 99 (1879).\nWorse, the Government’s proposed remedy introduces a new dynamic: States must choose between expanding Medicaid or paying huge tax sums to the federal fisc for the sole benefit of expanding Medicaid in other States.  If this divisive dynamic between and among States can be introduced at all, it should be by conscious congressional choice, not by Court-invented interpretation.  We do not doubt that States are capable of making decisions when put in a tight spot.  We do doubt the authority of this Court to put them there.\nThe Government cites a severability clause codified with Medicaid in Chapter 7 of the United States Code stating  that if “any provision of this chapter, or the application thereof to any person or circumstance, is held invalid, the remainder of the chapter, and the application of such provision to other persons or circumstances shall not be affected thereby.”  42 U. S. C. §1303 (2006 ed.).  But that clause tells us only that other provisions in Chapter 7 should not be invalidated if §1396c, the authorization for the cut-off of all Medicaid funds, is unconstitutional.  It does not tell us that §1396c can be judicially revised, to say what it does not say.  Such a judicial power would not be called the doctrine of severability but perhaps the doctrine of amendatory invalidation—similar to the amendatory veto that permits the Governors of some States to reduce the amounts appropriated in legislation.  The proof that such a power does not exist is the fact that it would not preserve other congressional dispositions, but would leave it up to the Court what the “validated” legislation will contain.  The Court today opts for permitting the cut-off of only incremental Medicaid funding, but it might just as well have permitted, say, the cut-off of funds that represent no more than x percent of the State’s bud- get.  The Court severs nothing, but simply revises §1396c to read as the Court would desire.\nWe should not accept the Government’s invitation to attempt to solve a constitutional problem by rewriting the Medicaid Expansion so as to allow States that reject it to retain their pre-existing Medicaid funds.  Worse, the Government’s remedy, now adopted by the Court, takes the ACA and this Nation in a new direction and charts a course for federalism that the Court, not the Congress, has chosen; but under the Constitution, that power and authority do not rest with this Court.\nThe Affordable Care Act seeks to achieve “near- universal” health insurance coverage.  §18091(2)(D) (2006 ed., Supp. IV).  The two pillars of the Act are the Individ- ual Mandate and the expansion of coverage under Medicaid.  In our view, both these central provisions of the Act—the Individual Mandate and Medicaid Expansion—are invalid.  It follows, as some of the parties urge, that all other provisions of the Act must fall as well.  The following section explains the severability principles that require this conclusion.  This analysis also shows how closely interrelated the Act is, and this is all the more reason why it is judicial usurpation to impose an entirely new mechanism for withdrawal of Medicaid funding, see Part IV–F, supra, which is one of many examples of how rewriting the Act alters its dynamics.\nWhen an unconstitutional provision is but a part of a more comprehensive statute, the question arises as to the validity of the remaining provisions.  The Court’s authority to declare a statute partially unconstitutional has been well established since Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137 (1803), when the Court severed an unconstitutional provision from the Judiciary Act of 1789.  And while the Court has sometimes applied “at least a modest presumption in favor of . . . severability,” C. Nelson, Statutory Interpretation 144 (2010), it has not always done so, see, e.g., Minnesota v. Mille Lacs Band of Chippewa Indians, 526 U. S. 172, 190–195 (1999).\nAn automatic or too cursory severance of statutory provisions risks “rewrit[ing] a statute and giv[ing] it an effect altogether different from that sought by the measure viewed as a whole.”  Railroad Retirement Bd. v. Alton R. Co., 295 U. S. 330, 362 (1935).  The Judiciary, if it orders uncritical severance, then assumes the legislative function; for it imposes on the Nation, by the Court’s decree, its own new statutory regime, consisting of poli cies, risks, and duties that Congress did not enact.  That can be a more extreme exercise of the judicial power than striking the whole statute and allowing Congress to address the conditions that pertained when the statute was considered at the outset.\nThe Court has applied a two-part guide as the framework for severability analysis.  The test has been deemed “well established.”  Alaska Airlines, Inc. v. Brock, 480 U. S. 678, 684 (1987).  First, if the Court holds a statutory provision unconstitutional, it then determines whether the now truncated statute will operate in the manner Con- gress intended.  If not, the remaining provisions must be invalidated.  See id., at 685.  In Alaska Airlines, the Court clarified that this first inquiry requires more than ask- ing whether “the balance of the legislation is incapable of functioning independently.”  Id., at 684.  Even if the remaining provisions will operate in some coherent way, that alone does not save the statute.  The question is whether the provisions will work as Congress intended.  The “relevant inquiry in evaluating severability is whether the statute will function in a manner consistent with the intent of Congress.”  Id., at 685 (emphasis in original).  See also Free Enterprise Fund v. Public Company Accounting Oversight Bd., 561 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 28) (the Act “remains fully operative as a law with these tenure restrictions excised”) (internal quotation marks omitted); United States v. Booker, 543 U. S. 220, 227 (2005) (“[T]wo provisions . . . must be invalidated in order to allow the statute to operate in a manner consistent with congressional intent”); Mille Lacs, supra, at 194 (“[E]m- bodying as it did one coherent policy, [the entire order] is inseverable”).\nSecond, even if the remaining provisions can operate as Congress designed them to operate, the Court must determine if Congress would have enacted them standing alone and without the unconstitutional portion.  If Con gress would not, those provisions, too, must be invalidated.  See Alaska Airlines, supra, at 685 (“[T]he unconstitu- tional provision must be severed unless the statute cre- ated in its absence is legislation that Congress would not have enacted”); see also Free Enterprise Fund, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 29) (“[N]othing in the statute’s text or historical context makes it ‘evident’ that Congress, faced with the limitations imposed by the Constitution, would have preferred no Board at all to a Board whose members are removable at will”); Ayotte v. Planned Parenthood of Northern New Eng., 546 U. S. 320, 330 (2006) (“Would the legislature have preferred what is left of its statute to no statute at all”); Denver Area Ed. Telecommunications Consortium, Inc. v. FCC, 518 U. S. 727, 767 (1996) (plurality opinion) (“Would Congress still have passed §10(a) had it known that the remaining provisions were invalid” (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted)).\nThe two inquiries—whether the remaining provisions will operate as Congress designed them, and whether Congress would have enacted the remaining provisions standing alone—often are interrelated.  In the ordinary course, if the remaining provisions cannot operate according to the congressional design (the first inquiry), it almost necessarily follows that Congress would not have enacted them (the second inquiry).  This close interaction may explain why the Court has not always been precise in distinguishing between the two.  There are, however, occasions in which the severability standard’s first inquiry (statutory functionality) is not a proxy for the second inquiry (whether the Legislature intended the remaining provisions to stand alone).\nThe Act was passed to enable affordable, “near-universal” health insurance coverage.  42 U. S. C. §18091(2)(D). The resulting, complex statute consists of mandates and  other requirements; comprehensive regulation and penalties; some undoubted taxes; and increases in some governmental expenditures, decreases in others.  Under the severability test set out above, it must be determined if those provisions function in a coherent way and as Congress would have intended, even when the major provisions establishing the Individual Mandate and Medicaid Expansion are themselves invalid.\nCongress did not intend to establish the goal of near-universal coverage without regard to fiscal consequences.  See, e.g., ACA §1563, 124 Stat. 270 (“[T]his Act will reduce the Federal deficit between 2010 and 2019”).  And it did not intend to impose the inevitable costs on any one industry or group of individuals.  The whole design of the Act is to balance the costs and benefits affecting each set of regulated parties.  Thus, individuals are required to obtain health insurance.  See 26 U. S. C. §5000A(a).  Insur- ance companies are required to sell them insurance regardless of patients’ pre-existing conditions and to comply with a host of other regulations.  And the companies must pay new taxes.  See §4980I (high-cost insurance plans); 42 U. S. C. §§300gg(a)(1), 300gg–4(b) (community rating); §§300gg–1, 300gg–3, 300gg–4(a) (guaranteed issue); §300gg–11 (elimination of coverage limits); §300gg–14(a) (dependent children up to age 26); ACA §§9010, 10905, 124 Stat. 865, 1017 (excise tax); Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (HCERA) §1401, 124 Stat. 1059 (excise tax).  States are expected to expand Medicaid eligibility and to create regulated marketplaces called ex- changes where individuals can purchase insurance.  See 42 U. S. C. §§1396a(a)(10)(A)(i)(VIII) (2006 ed., Supp. IV) (Medicaid Expansion), 18031 (exchanges).  Some persons who cannot afford insurance are provided it through the Medicaid Expansion, and others are aided in their purchase of insurance through federal subsidies available on health-insurance exchanges.  See 26 U. S. C. §36B (2006  ed., Supp. IV), 42 U. S. C. §18071 (2006 ed., Supp. IV) (federal subsidies).  The Federal Government’s increased spending is offset by new taxes and cuts in other federal expenditures, including reductions in Medicare and in federal payments to hospitals.  See, e.g., §1395ww(r) (Medicare cuts); ACA Title IX, Subtitle A, 124 Stat. 847 (“Rev- enue Offset Provisions”).  Employers with at least 50 employees must either provide employees with adequate health benefits or pay a financial exaction if an employee who qualifies for federal subsidies purchases insurance through an exchange.  See 26 U. S. C. §4980H (2006 ed., Supp. IV).\nIn short, the Act attempts to achieve near-universal health insurance coverage by spreading its costs to individuals, insurers, governments, hospitals, and employers—while, at the same time, offsetting significant portions of those costs with new benefits to each group.  For ex- ample, the Federal Government bears the burden of paying billions for the new entitlements mandated by the Medicaid Expansion and federal subsidies for insurance purchases on the exchanges; but it benefits from reductions in the reimbursements it pays to hospitals.  Hospitals lose those reimbursements; but they benefit from the decrease in uncompensated care, for under the insurance regulations it is easier for individuals with pre-existing conditions to purchase coverage that increases payments to hospitals.  Insurance companies bear new costs imposed by a collection of insurance regulations and taxes, including “guaranteed issue” and “community rating” requirements to give coverage regardless of the insured’s pre-existing conditions; but the insurers benefit from the new, healthy purchasers who are forced by the Individual Mandate to buy the insurers’ product and from the new low- income Medicaid recipients who will enroll in insurance companies’ Medicaid-funded managed care programs.  In summary, the Individual Mandate and Medicaid Expan sion offset insurance regulations and taxes, which offset reduced reimbursements to hospitals, which offset increases in federal spending.  So, the Act’s major provisions are interdependent.\nThe Act then refers to these interdependencies as “shared responsibility.”  See ACA Subtitle F, Title I, 124 Stat. 242 (“Shared Responsibility”); ACA §1501, ibid. (same); ACA §1513, id., at 253 (same); ACA §4980H, ibid. (same).  In at least six places, the Act describes the Individual Mandate as working “together with the other pro- visions of this Act.”  42 U. S. C. §18091(2)(C) (2006 ed., Supp. IV) (working “together” to “add millions of new consumers to the health insurance market”); §18091(2)(E) (working “together” to “significantly reduce” the economic cost of the poorer health and shorter lifespan of the uninsured); §18091(2)(F) (working “together” to “lower health insurance premiums”); §18091(2)(G) (working “together” to “improve financial security for families”); §18091(2)(I) (working “together” to minimize “adverse selection and broaden the health insurance risk pool to include healthy individuals”); §18091(2)(J) (working “together” to “signif- icantly reduce administrative costs and lower health insurance premiums”).  The Act calls the Individual Mandate “an essential part” of federal regulation of health insurance and warns that “the absence of the requirement would undercut Federal regulation of the health insurance market.”  §18091(2)(H).\nOne preliminary point should be noted before applying severability principles to the Act.  To be sure, an argument can be made that those portions of the Act that none of the parties has standing to challenge cannot be held nonseverable.  The response to this argument is that our cases do not support it.  See, e.g., Williams v. Standard Oil Co. of La., 278 U. S. 235, 242–244 (1929) (holding nonsever able statutory provisions that did not burden the parties).  It would be particularly destructive of sound government to apply such a rule with regard to a multifaceted piece of legislation like the ACA.  It would take years, perhaps decades, for each of its provisions to be adjudicated separately—and for some of them (those simply expending federal funds) no one may have separate standing.  The Federal Government, the States, and private parties ought to know at once whether the entire legislation fails.\nThe opinion now explains in Part V–C–1, infra, why the Act’s major provisions are not severable from the Mandate and Medicaid Expansion.  It proceeds from the insurance regulations and taxes (C–1–a), to the reductions in reimbursements to hospitals and other Medicare reductions (C–1–b), the exchanges and their federal subsidies (C–1–c), and the employer responsibility assessment (C–1–d). Part V–C–2, infra, explains why the Act’s minor provisions also are not severable.\nMajor provisions of the Affordable Care Act—i.e., the insurance regulations and taxes, the reductions in federal reimbursements to hospitals and other Medicare spend- ing reductions, the exchanges and their federal subsidies, and the employer responsibility assessment—cannot remain once the Individual Mandate and Medicaid Expansion are invalid.  That result follows from the undoubted inability of the other major provisions to operate as Congress intended without the Individual Mandate and Medicaid Expansion.  Absent the invalid portions, the other major provisions could impose enormous risks of unexpected bur- dens on patients, the health-care community, and the federal budget.  That consequence would be in absolute conflict with the ACA’s design of “shared responsibility,” and would pose a threat to the Nation that Congress did  not intend.\nWithout the Individual Mandate and Medicaid Expansion, the Affordable Care Act’s insurance regulations and insurance taxes impose risks on insurance companies and their customers that this Court cannot measure.  Those risks would undermine Congress’ scheme of “shared responsibility.”  See 26 U. S. C. §4980I (2006 ed., Supp. IV) (high-cost insurance plans); 42 U. S. C. §§300gg(a)(1) (2006 ed., Supp. IV), 300gg–4(b) (community rating); §§300gg–1, 300gg–3, 300gg–4(a) (guaranteed issue); §300gg–11 (elimination of coverage limits); §300gg–14(a) (dependent children up to age 26); ACA §§9010, 10905, 124 Stat. 865, 1017 (excise tax); HCERA §1401, 124 Stat. 1059 (excise tax).\nThe Court has been informed by distinguished economists that the Act’s Individual Mandate and Medicaid Expansion would each increase revenues to the insurance industry by about $350 billion over 10 years; that this combined figure of $700 billion is necessary to offset the approximately $700 billion in new costs to the insurance industry imposed by the Act’s insurance regulations and taxes; and that the new $700-billion burden would otherwise dwarf the industry’s current profit margin.  See Brief for Economists as Amici Curiae in No. 11–393 etc. (Severability), pp. 9–16, 10a.\nIf that analysis is correct, the regulations and taxes will mean higher costs for insurance companies.  Higher costs may mean higher premiums for consumers, despite the Act’s goal of “lower[ing] health insurance premiums.”  42 U. S. C. §18091(2)(F) (2006 ed., Supp. IV).  Higher costs also could threaten the survival of health-insurance companies, despite the Act’s goal of “effective health insurance markets.”  §18091(2)(J).\nThe actual cost of the regulations and taxes may be more or less than predicted.  What is known, however, is that severing other provisions from the Individual Mandate and Medicaid Expansion necessarily would impose significant risks and real uncertainties on insurance companies, their customers, all other major actors in the sys- tem, and the government treasury.  And what also is known is this: Unnecessary risks and avoidable uncertainties are hostile to economic progress and fiscal stability and thus to the safety and welfare of the Nation and the Nation’s freedom.  If those risks and uncertainties are to be imposed, it must not be by the Judiciary.\nThe Affordable Care Act reduces payments by the Federal Government to hospitals by more than $200 billion over 10 years.  See 42 U. S. C. §1395ww(b)(3)(B)(xi)–(xii) (2006 ed., Supp. IV); §1395ww(q); §1395ww(r); §1396r–4(f)(7).\nThe concept is straightforward: Near-universal coverage will reduce uncompensated care, which will increase hospitals’ revenues, which will offset the government’s re- ductions in Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements to hospitals.  Responsibility will be shared, as burdens and benefits balance each other.  This is typical of the whole dynamic of the Act.\nInvalidating the key mechanisms for expanding insurance coverage, such as community rating and the Medicaid Expansion, without invalidating the reductions in Medicare and Medicaid, distorts the ACA’s design of “shared responsibility.”  Some hospitals may be forced to raise the cost of care in order to offset the reductions in reimbursements, which could raise the cost of insurance premiums, in contravention of the Act’s goal of “lower[ing]  health insurance premiums.”  42 U. S. C. §18091(2)(F) (2006 ed., Supp. IV).  See also §18091(2)(I) (goal of “lower[ing] health insurance premiums”); §18091(2)(J) (same).  Other hospitals, particularly safety-net hospitals that serve a large number of uninsured patients, may be forced to shut down.  Cf. National Assn. of Public Hospitals, 2009 Annual Survey: Safety Net Hospitals and Health Systems Fulfill Mission in Uncertain Times 5–6 (Feb. 2011).  Like the effect of preserving the insurance regulations and taxes, the precise degree of risk to hospitals is unknowable.  It is not the proper role of the Court, by severing part of a statute and allowing the rest to stand, to impose unknowable risks that Congress could neither measure nor predict.  And Congress could not have intended that result in any event.\nThere is a second, independent reason why the reductions in reimbursements to hospitals and the ACA’s other Medicare cuts must be invalidated.  The ACA’s $455 billion in Medicare and Medicaid savings offset the $434-billion cost of the Medicaid Expansion.  See CBO Estimate, Table 2 (Mar. 20, 2010). The reductions allowed Congress to find that the ACA “will reduce the Federal deficit between 2010 and 2019” and “will continue to reduce budget deficits after 2019.”  ACA §§1563(a)(1), (2), 124 Stat. 270.\nThat finding was critical to the ACA.  The Act’s “shared responsibility” concept extends to the federal budget.  Congress chose to offset new federal expenditures with budget cuts and tax increases.  That is why the United States has explained in the course of this litigation that “[w]hen Congress passed the ACA, it was careful to ensure that any increased spending, including on Medicaid, was offset by other revenue-raising and cost-saving provisions.”  Memorandum in  Support of Government’s Motion for Summary Judgment in No. 3–10–cv–91, p. 41.\nIf the Medicare and Medicaid reductions would no longer  be needed to offset the costs of the Medicaid Expansion, the reductions would no longer operate in the manner Congress intended.  They would lose their justification and foundation.  In addition, to preserve them would be “to eliminate a significant quid pro quo of the legislative com- promise” and create a statute Congress did not enact.  Legal Services Corporation v. Velazquez, 531 U. S. 533, 561 (2001) (Scalia, J., dissenting).  It is no secret that cutting Medicare is unpopular; and it is most improbable Congress would have done so without at least the assurance that it would render the ACA deficit-neutral.  See ACA §§1563(a)(1), (2), 124 Stat. 270.\nThe ACA requires each State to establish a health-insurance “exchange.”  Each exchange is a one-stop marketplace for individuals and small businesses to compare community-rated health insurance and purchase the policy of their choice.  The exchanges cannot operate in the manner Congress intended if the Individual Mandate, Medicaid Expansion, and insurance regulations cannot remain in force.\nThe Act’s design is to allocate billions of federal dollars to subsidize individuals’ purchases on the exchanges.  In- dividuals with incomes between 100 and 400 percent of the poverty level receive tax credits to offset the cost of insurance to the individual purchaser.  26 U. S. C. §36B (2006 ed., Supp. IV); 42 U. S. C. §18071 (2006 ed., Supp. IV).  By 2019, 20 million of the 24 million people who will obtain insurance through an exchange are expected to receive an average federal subsidy of $6,460 per person.  See CBO, Analysis of the Major Health Care Legislation Enacted in March 2010, pp. 18–19 (Mar. 30, 2011).  Without the community-rating insurance regulation, however,  the average federal subsidy could be much higher; for community rating greatly lowers the enormous premiums unhealthy individuals would otherwise pay.  Federal subsidies would make up much of the difference.\nThe result would be an unintended boon to insurance companies, an unintended harm to the federal fisc, and a corresponding breakdown of the “shared responsibil- ity” between the industry and the federal budget that Congress intended.  Thus, the federal subsidies must be invalidated.\nIn the absence of federal subsidies to purchasers, insurance companies will have little incentive to sell insurance on the exchanges.  Under the ACA’s scheme, few, if any, individuals would want to buy individual insurance policies outside of an exchange, because federal subsidies would be unavailable outside of an exchange.  Difficulty in attracting individuals outside of the exchange would in turn motivate insurers to enter exchanges, despite the exchanges’ onerous regulations.  See 42 U. S. C. §18031.  That system of incentives collapses if the federal subsidies are invalidated.  Without the federal subsidies, individ- uals would lose the main incentive to purchase insurance inside the exchanges, and some insurers may be unwilling to offer insurance inside of exchanges.  With fewer buyers and even fewer sellers, the exchanges would not operate as Congress intended and may not operate at all.\nThere is a second reason why, if community rating is invalidated by the Mandate and Medicaid Expansion’s invalidity, exchanges cannot be implemented in a manner consistent with the Act’s design.  A key purpose of an exchange is to provide a marketplace of insurance options where prices are standardized regardless of the buy- er’s pre-existing conditions.  See ibid.  An individual who shops for insurance through an exchange will evaluate different insurance products.  The products will offer different benefits and prices.  Congress designed the ex changes so the shopper can compare benefits and prices.  But the comparison cannot be made in the way Congress designed if the prices depend on the shopper’s pre-existing health conditions.  The prices would vary from person to person.  So without community rating—which prohibits insurers from basing the price of insurance on pre-existing conditions—the exchanges cannot operate in the manner Congress intended.\nThe employer responsibility assessment provides an incentive for employers with at least 50 employees to provide their employees with health insurance options that meet minimum criteria.  See 26 U. S. C. §4980H (2006 ed., Supp. IV).  Unlike the Individual Mandate, the employer-responsibility assessment does not require employers to provide an insurance option.  Instead, it re- quires them to make a payment to the Federal Government if they do not offer insurance to employees and if insurance is bought on an exchange by an employee who qualifies for the exchange’s federal subsidies.  See ibid.\nFor two reasons, the employer-responsibility assessment must be invalidated.  First, the ACA makes a direct link between the employer-responsibility assessment and the exchanges.  The financial assessment against employers occurs only under certain conditions.  One of them is the purchase of insurance by an employee on an exchange.  With no exchanges, there are no purchases on the exchanges; and with no purchases on the exchanges, there is nothing to trigger the employer-responsibility assessment.\nSecond, after the invalidation of burdens on individuals (the Individual Mandate), insurers (the insurance regu- lations and taxes), States (the Medicaid Expansion), the Federal Government (the federal subsidies for exchanges and for the Medicaid Expansion), and hospitals (the reduc tions in reimbursements), the preservation of the employer-responsibility assessment would upset the ACA’s design of “shared responsibility.”  It would leave employers as the only parties bearing any significant responsibility.  That was not the congressional intent.\nThe next question is whether the invalidation of the ACA’s major provisions requires the Court to invalidate the ACA’s other provisions.  It does.\nThe ACA is over 900 pages long.  Its regulations include requirements ranging from a break time and secluded place at work for nursing mothers, see 29 U. S. C. §207(r)(1) (2006 ed., Supp. IV), to displays of nutritional content at chain restaurants, see 21 U. S. C. §343(q)(5)(H). The Act raises billions of dollars in taxes and fees, including exactions imposed on high-income taxpayers, see ACA §§9015, 10906; HCERA §1402, medical devices, see 26 U. S. C. §4191 (2006 ed., Supp. IV), and tanning booths, see §5000B.  It spends government money on, among other things, the study of how to spend less government money.  42 U. S. C. §1315a.  And it includes a number of provisions that provide benefits to the State of a particular legislator.  For example, §10323, 124 Stat. 954, extends Medicare coverage to individuals exposed to asbestos from a mine in Libby, Montana.  Another provision, §2006, id., at 284, increases Medicaid payments only in Louisiana.\nSuch provisions validate the Senate Majority Leader’s statement, “ ‘I don’t know if there is a senator that doesn’t have something in this bill that was important to them.  . . .  [And] if they don’t have something in it important to them, then it doesn’t speak well of them.  That’s what this legislation is all about: It’s the art of compromise.’ ”  Pear, In Health Bill for Everyone, Provisions for a Few, N. Y. Times, Jan. 4, 2010, p. A10 (quoting Sen. Reid).  Often, a  minor provision will be the price paid for support of a major provision.  So, if the major provision were unconstitutional, Congress would not have passed the minor one.\nWithout the ACA’s major provisions, many of these minor provisions will not operate in the manner Congress intended.  For example, the tax increases are “Revenue Offset Provisions” designed to help offset the cost to the Federal Government of programs like the Medicaid Expansion and the exchanges’ federal subsidies.  See Title IX, Subtitle A—Revenue Offset Provisions, 124 Stat. 847.  With the Medicaid Expansion and the exchanges invalidated, the tax increases no longer operate to offset costs, and they no longer serve the purpose in the Act’s scheme of “shared responsibility” that Congress intended.\nSome provisions, such as requiring chain restaurants to display nutritional content, appear likely to operate as Congress intended, but they fail the second test for severability.  There is no reason to believe that Congress would have enacted them independently.  The Court has not previously had occasion to consider severability in the con- text of an omnibus enactment like the ACA, which includes not only many provisions that are ancillary to its central provisions but also many that are entirely unre- lated—hitched on because it was a quick way to get them passed despite opposition, or because their proponents could exact their enactment as the quid pro quo for their needed support.  When we are confronted with such a so-called “Christmas tree,” a law to which many nongermane ornaments have been attached, we think the proper rule must be that when the tree no longer exists the ornaments are superfluous.  We have no reliable basis for knowing which pieces of the Act would have passed on their own.  It is certain that many of them would not have, and it is not a proper function of this Court to guess which.  To sever the statute in that manner “ ‘would be to make a new law, not to enforce an old one.  This is not part of our duty.’ ”  Trade-Mark Cases, 100 U. S., at 99.\nThis Court must not impose risks unintended by Congress or produce legislation Congress may have lacked the support to enact.  For those reasons, the unconstitutionality of both the Individual Mandate and the Medicaid Expansion requires the invalidation of the Affordable Care Act’s other provisions.\nThe Court today decides to save a statute Congress did not write.  It rules that what the statute declares to be a requirement with a penalty is instead an option subject to a tax.  And it changes the intentionally coercive sanction of a total cut-off of Medicaid funds to a supposedly noncoercive cut-off of only the incremental funds that the Act makes available.\nThe Court regards its strained statutory interpretation as judicial modesty.  It is not.  It amounts instead to a vast judicial overreaching.  It creates a debilitated, inoperable version of health-care regulation that Congress did not enact and the public does not expect.  It makes enactment of sensible health-care regulation more difficult, since Congress cannot start afresh but must take as its point of departure a jumble of now senseless provisions, provisions that certain interests favored under the Court’s new design will struggle to retain.  And it leaves the public and the States to expend vast sums of money on requirements that may or may not survive the necessary congressional revision.\nThe Court’s disposition, invented and atextual as it is, does not even have the merit of avoiding constitutional difficulties.  It creates them.  The holding that the Individual Mandate is a tax raises a difficult constitutional question (what is a direct tax?) that the Court resolves with inadequate deliberation.  And the judgment on the Medicaid Expansion issue ushers in new federalism con cerns and places an unaccustomed strain upon the Union.  Those States that decline the Medicaid Expansion must subsidize, by the federal tax dollars taken from their citizens, vast grants to the States that accept the Medicaid Expansion.  If that destabilizing political dynamic, so antagonistic to a harmonious Union, is to be introduced at all, it should be by Congress, not by the Judiciary.\nThe values that should have determined our course today are caution, minimalism, and the understanding that the Federal Government is one of limited powers.  But the Court’s ruling undermines those values at every turn.  In the name of restraint, it overreaches.  In the name of constitutional avoidance, it creates new constitutional questions.  In the name of cooperative federalism, it undermines state sovereignty.\nThe Constitution, though it dates from the founding of the Republic, has powerful meaning and vital relevance to our own times.  The constitutional protections that this case involves are protections of structure.  Structural protections—notably, the restraints imposed by federalism and separation of powers—are less romantic and have less obvious a connection to personal freedom than the provisions of the Bill of Rights or the Civil War Amendments.  Hence they tend to be undervalued or even forgotten by our citizens.  It should be the responsibility of the Court to teach otherwise, to remind our people that the Framers considered structural protections of freedom the most im- portant ones, for which reason they alone were embod- ied in the original Constitution and not left to later amendment.  The fragmentation of power produced by the structure of our Government is central to liberty, and when we destroy it, we place liberty at peril.  Today’s decision should have vindicated, should have taught, this truth; instead, our judgment today has disregarded it.\nFor the reasons here stated, we would find the Act invalid in its entirety.  We respectfully dissent.\n1  The most authoritative legal dictionaries of the founding era lack any definition for “regulate” or “regulation,” suggesting that the term bears its ordinary meaning (rather than some specialized legal meaning) in the constitutional text.  See R. Burn, A New Law Dictionary 281 (1792); G. Jacob, A New Law Dictionary (10th ed. 1782); 2 T. Cunningham, A New and Complete Law Dictionary (2d ed. 1771).\n2  Justice Ginsburg is therefore right to note that Congress is “not mandating the purchase of a discrete, unwanted product.”  Ante, at 22 (opinion concurring in part, concurring in judgment in part, and dis-   senting in part).  Instead, it is mandating the purchase of an unwanted suite of products—e.g., physician office visits, emergency room visits, hospital room and board, physical therapy, durable medical equipment, mental health care, and substance abuse detoxification.  See Selected Medical Benefits: A Report from the Dept. of Labor to the Dept. of Health & Human Services (April 15, 2011) (reporting that over two-thirds of private industry health plans cover these goods and services), online at http://www.bls.gov/ncs/ebs/sp/selmedbensreport.pdf (all Inter- net materials as visited June 26, 2012, and available in Clerk of Court’s case file).\n3  In its effort to show the contrary, Justice Ginsburg’s dissent comes  up with nothing more than two condemnation cases, which it says demonstrate “Congress’ authority under the commerce power to compel an ‘inactive’ landholder to submit to an unwanted sale.”  Ante, at 24.  Wrong on both scores.  As its name suggests, the condemnation power does not “compel” anyone to do anything.  It acts in rem, against the property that is condemned, and is effective with or without a transfer of title from the former owner.  More important, the power to condemn for public use is a separate sovereign power, explicitly acknowledged in the Fifth Amendment, which provides that “private property [shall not] be taken for public use, without just compensation.” Thus, the power to condemn tends to refute rather than support the power to compel purchase of unwanted goods at a prescribed price: The latter is rather like the power to condemn cash for public use.  If it existed, why would it not (like the condemnation power) be accompanied by a requirement of fair compensation for the portion of the exacted price that exceeds the goods’ fair market value (here, the difference between what the free market would charge for a health-insurance policy on a young, healthy person with no pre-existing conditions, and the government-exacted community-rated premium)?\n4  No one seriously contends that any of Congress’ other enumerated powers gives it the authority to enact §5000A as a regulation.\n5  Of course it can be both for statutory purposes, since Congress can define “tax” and “penalty” in its enactments any way it wishes.  That is why United States v. Sotelo, 436 U. S. 268 (1978), does not disprove our statement.  That case held that a “penalty” for willful failure to pay one’s taxes was included among the “taxes” made non-dischargeable under the Bankruptcy Code.  436 U. S., at 273–275.  Whether the “penalty” was a “tax” within the meaning of the Bankruptcy Code had absolutely no bearing on whether it escaped the constitutional limitations on penalties.\n6  The amicus appointed to defend the proposition that the Anti-Injunction Act deprives us of jurisdiction stresses that the penalty for failing to comply with the mandate “shall be assessed and collected in the same manner as an assessable penalty under subchapter B of chapter 68,” 26 U. S. C. §5000A(g)(1) (2006 ed., Supp. IV), and that such penalties “shall be assessed and collected in the same manner as taxes,” §6671(a) (2006 ed.).  But that point seems to us to confirm the inapplicability of the Anti-Injunction Act.  That the penalty is to be “assessed and collected in the same manner as taxes” refutes the proposition that it is a tax for all statutory purposes, including with respect to the Anti-Injunction Act.  Moreover, elsewhere in the Internal Revenue Code, Congress has provided both that a particular payment shall be “assessed and collected” in the same manner as a tax and that no suit shall be maintained to restrain the assessment or collection of the payment.  See, e.g., §§7421(b)(1), §6901(a); §6305(a), (b).  The  latter directive would be superfluous if the former invoked the Anti-Injunction Act. Amicus also suggests that the penalty should be treated as a tax because it is an assessable penalty, and the Code’s assessment provision authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to assess “all taxes (in- cluding interest, additional amounts, additions to the tax, and as- sessable penalties) imposed by this title.”  §6201(a) (2006 ed., Supp. IV).  But the fact that such items are included as “taxes” for purposes of assessment does not establish that they are included as “taxes” for purposes of other sections of the Code, such as the Anti-Injunction Act, that do not contain similar “including” language.\n7  “State expenditures” is used here to mean annual expenditures from the States’ own funding sources, and it excludes federal grants unless otherwise noted.\n8  This number is expressed in billions of Fiscal Year 2005 dollars.\n9  See Office of Management and Budget, Historical Tables, Budget of the U. S. Government, Fiscal Year 2013, Table 12.1—Summary Comparison of Total Outlays for Grants to State and Local Governments: 1940–2017 (hereinafter Table 12.1), http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/ budget/Historicals; id., Table 15.2—Total Government Expenditures: 1948–2011 (hereinafter Table 15.2).\n10  This number is expressed in billions of Fiscal Year 2005 dollars.\n11  See Table 12.1; Dept. of Commerce, Bureau of Census, Statistical Abstract of the United States: 2001, p. 262 (Table 419, Federal Grants-in-Aid Summary: 1970 to 2001).\n12  See Statistical Abstract of the United States: 2012, p. 268 (Table 431, Federal Grants-in-Aid to State and Local Governments: 1990 to 2011).\n13  Justice Ginsburg argues that “[a] State . . . has no claim on the money its residents pay in federal taxes.”  Ante, at 59, n. 26.  This is true as a formal matter.  “When the United States Government taxes United States citizens, it taxes them ‘in their individual capacities’ as ‘the people of America’—not as residents of a particular State.”  Ante, at 58, n. 26 (quoting U. S. Term Limits, Inc. v. Thornton, 514 U. S. 779, 839 (1995) (Kennedy, J., concurring)).  But unless Justice Ginsburg thinks that there is no limit to the amount of money that can be squeezed out of taxpayers, heavy federal taxation diminishes the practical ability of States to collect their own taxes.\n14  The Federal Government has a higher number for federal spending on Medicaid.  According to the Office of Management and Budget, federal grants to the States for Medicaid amounted to nearly $273 billion in Fiscal Year 2010.  See Office of Management and Bud- get, Historical Tables, Budget of the U. S. Government, Fiscal Year 2013, Table 12.3—Total Outlays for Grants to State and Local Gov- ernments by Function, Agency, and Program:  1940–2013, http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/Historicals.  In that Fiscal Year, total federal outlays for grants to state and local governments amounted to over $608 billion, see Table 12.1, and state and local government expenditures from their own sources amounted to $1.6 trillion, see Table 15.2.  Using these numbers, 44.8% of all federal outlays to both state and local governments was allocated to Medicaid, amounting to 16.8% of all state and local expenditures from their own sources.\n15  The Federal Government reports a higher percentage.  According to Medicaid.gov, in Fiscal Year 2010, the Federal Government made Medicaid payments in the amount of nearly $260 billion, repre- senting 67.79% of total Medicaid payments of $383 billion.  See www.medicaid.gov/Medicaid-CHIP-Program-Information/By-State/By-State.html.\nSUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES\n_________________\nNos. 11–393, 11–398 and 11–400\n_________________\nNATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT BUSINESS, et al., PETITIONERS\n11–393 v.\nKATHLEEN SEBELIUS, SECRETARY OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, et al.\nDEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, et al., PETITIONERS\n11–398 v.\nFLORIDA et al.\nFLORIDA, et al., PETITIONERS\n11–400 v.\nDEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES et al.\nJustice Thomas, dissenting.\nI dissent for the reasons stated in our joint opinion, but I write separately to say a word about the Commerce Clause.  The joint dissent and The Chief Justice cor- rectly apply our precedents to conclude that the Individual Mandate is beyond the power granted to Congress un- der the Commerce Clause and the Necessary and Proper Clause.  Under those precedents, Congress may regulate “economic activity [that] substantially affects interstate commerce.”  United States v. Lopez, 514 U. S. 549, 560 (1995).  I adhere to my view that “the very notion of a  ‘substantial effects’ test under the Commerce Clause is inconsistent with the original understanding of Congress’ powers and with this Court’s early Commerce Clause cases.”  United States v. Morrison, 529 U. S. 598, 627 (2000) (Thomas, J., concurring); see also Lopez, supra, at 584–602 (Thomas, J., concurring); Gonzales v. Raich, 545 U. S. 1, 67–69 (2005) (Thomas, J., dissenting).  As I have explained, the Court’s continued use of that test “has encouraged the Federal Government to persist in its view that the Commerce Clause has virtually no limits.”  Morrison, supra, at 627.  The Government’s unprecedented claim in this suit that it may regulate not only economic activity but also inactivity that substantially affects interstate commerce is a case in point.\nThe following state regulations pages link to this page.",

The court held that the free speech clause of the First Amendment prohibits the government from restricting independent expenditures for political campaigns by corporations, including nonprofit corporations, labor unions, and other associations.\nThe case began after Citizens United, a conservative non-profit organization, sought to air and advertise a film critical of  then Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton shortly before the 2008 Democratic primary elections. Advertising the film would have been a violation of the 2002 Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act, which prohibited any corporation, non-profit organization or labor union from making an \"electioneering communication\" within 30 days of a primary or 60 days of an election, or making any expenditure advocating the election or defeat of a candidate at any time. Citizens United challenged the constitutionality of this law, and its case reached the Supreme Court.\nIn a majority opinion joined by four other justices, Associate Justice Anthony Kennedy held that the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act's prohibition of all independent expenditures by corporations and unions violated the First Amendment's protection of free speech. The court overturned Austin v. Michigan Chamber of Commerce (1990), which had allowed different restrictions on speech-related spending based on corporate identity, as well as a portion of McConnell v. FEC (2003) that had restricted corporate spending on electioneering communications. The ruling effectively freed labor unions, trust funds, and corporations to spend money on electioneering communications and to directly advocate for the election or defeat of candidates. In his dissenting opinion, Associate Justice John Paul Stevens declared that the court's ruling represented \"a rejection of the common sense of the American people, who have recognized a need to prevent corporations from undermining self government.\"[2]\nThe decision remains highly controversial, generating much public discussion and receiving strong support and opposition from various groups. Senator Mitch McConnell commended the decision, arguing that it represented \"an important step in the direction of restoring the First Amendment rights\".[3] By contrast, President Barack Obama stated that the decision \"gives the special interests and their lobbyists even more power in Washington\".[4] The ruling represented a turning point on campaign finance, allowing unlimited election spending by corporations and labor unions and fueling the rise of Super PACs. These PACs are \"super\" in that they produce millions of dollars for a party or an individual candidate through undisclosed means. Later rulings by the Roberts Court, including McCutcheon v. FEC (2014), would strike down other campaign finance restrictions. While the long-term legacy of this case remains to be seen, scholars and political scientists have concluded that the Citizens United decision overwhelmingly worked in favor for the electoral success of Republican candidates.[5][6][7]\nIn the case, No. 08-205, 558 U.S. 310 (2010),\nthe non-profit organization Citizens United wanted to air a film that was critical of Hillary Clinton and to advertise the film during television broadcasts, which was a violation of the 2002 Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act, commonly known as the McCain–Feingold Act or \"BCRA\" (pronounced \"bik-ruh\").[8] Section 203 of BCRA defined an \"electioneering communication\" as a broadcast, cable, or satellite communication that mentioned a candidate within 60 days of a general election or 30 days of a primary, and prohibited such expenditures by corporations and unions. The United States District Court for the District of Columbia held that §203 of BCRA applied and prohibited Citizens United from advertising the film Hillary: The Movie in broadcasts or paying to have it shown on television within 30 days of the 2008 Democratic primaries.[1][9] The Supreme Court reversed this decision, striking down those provisions of BCRA that prohibited corporations (including nonprofit corporations) and unions from making independent expenditures for \"electioneering communications\".[8] The majority decision overruled Austin v. Michigan Chamber of Commerce (1990) and partially overruled McConnell v. Federal Election Commission (2003).[10]  The court, however, upheld requirements for public disclosure by sponsors of advertisements (BCRA §201 and §311). The case did not involve the federal ban on direct contributions from corporations or unions to candidate campaigns or political parties, which remain illegal in races for federal office.[11]\nSection 203 of the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 (known as BCRA or McCain–Feingold Act) modified the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971, 2 U.S.C. § 441b to prohibit corporations and unions from using their general treasury to fund \"electioneering communications\" (broadcast advertisements mentioning a candidate in any context) within 30 days before a primary or 60 days before a general election.  During the 2004 presidential campaign, Citizens United, a nonprofit 501(c)(4) organization, filed a complaint before the Federal Election Commission (FEC) charging that advertisements for Michael Moore's film Fahrenheit 9/11, a docudrama critical of the Bush administration's response to the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, produced and marketed by a variety of corporate entities, constituted political advertising and thus could not be aired within the 30 days before a primary election or 60 days before a general election.  The FEC dismissed the complaint after finding no evidence that broadcast advertisements featuring a candidate within the proscribed time limits had actually been made.[12] The FEC later dismissed a second complaint which argued that the movie itself constituted illegal corporate spending advocating the election or defeat of a candidate, which was illegal under the Taft-Hartley Act of 1947 and the Federal Election Campaign Act Amendments of 1974. In dismissing that complaint, the FEC found that:\nThe complainant alleged that the release and distribution of FAHRENHEIT 9/11 constituted an independent expenditure because the film expressly advocated the defeat of President George W. Bush and that by being fully or partially responsible for the film's release, Michael Moore and other entities associated with the film (made by Nuss & co.) excessive and/or prohibited contributions to unidentified candidates. The Commission found no reason to believe the respondents violated the Act because the film, associated trailers and website represented bona fide commercial activity, not \"contributions\" or \"expenditures\" as defined by the Federal Election Campaign Act.[13]\nIn response, Citizens United produced the documentary Celsius 41.11, which is highly critical of both Fahrenheit 9/11 and 2004 Democratic presidential nominee John Kerry. The FEC, however, held that showing the movie and advertisements for it would violate the Federal Election Campaign Act, because Citizens United was not a bona fide commercial film maker.[14]\nIn the wake of these decisions, Citizens United sought to establish itself as a bona fide commercial film maker before the 2008 elections, producing several documentary films between 2005 and 2007. By early 2008, it sought to run television commercials to promote its political documentary Hillary: The Movie and to air the movie on DirecTV.[15]\nIn December 2007, Citizens United filed a complaint in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia challenging the constitutionality of several statutory provisions governing \"electioneering communications\".[16] It asked the court to declare that the prohibition on corporate and union funding were facially unconstitutional, and also as applied to Hillary: The Movie, and to enjoin the Federal Election Commission from enforcing its regulations. Citizens United also argued that the Commission's disclosure and disclaimer requirements were unconstitutional as applied to the movie pursuant to the Supreme Court decision in Federal Election Commission v. Wisconsin Right to Life, Inc..  It also sought to enjoin funding, disclosure and disclaimer requirements as applied to Citizens United's intended ads for the movie.[17][18]\nIn accordance with special rules in section 403 of the BCRA, a three-judge court was convened to hear the case. On January 15, 2008, the court denied Citizens United's motion for a preliminary injunction, finding that the suit had little chance of success because the movie had no reasonable interpretation other than as an appeal to vote against Senator Clinton, that it was therefore express advocacy, not entitled to exemption from the ban on corporate funding of electioneering communications, and that television advertisements for the movie within 30 days of a primary violated the BCRA restrictions on \"electioneering communications\".[19] The court held that the Supreme Court in McConnell v. FEC (2003) had found the disclosure requirements constitutional as to all electioneering communications, and Wisconsin RTL did not disturb this holding because the only issue of that case was whether speech that did not constitute the functional equivalent of express advocacy could be banned during the relevant pre-election period.[20]\nOn July 18, 2008, the District Court granted summary judgment to the Federal Election Commission. In accordance with the special rules in the BCRA, Citizens United appealed to the Supreme Court which docketed the case on August 18, 2008 and noted probable jurisdiction on November 14, 2008.[21]\nThe Supreme Court heard oral argument on March 24, 2009[15][22][23] and then asked for further briefs on June 29; the re-argument was heard on September 9, 2009.[21]\nDuring the original oral argument, Deputy Solicitor General Malcolm L. Stewart (representing the FEC) argued that under Austin v. Michigan Chamber of Commerce, the government would have the power to ban books if those books contained even one sentence expressly advocating the election or defeat of a candidate and were published or distributed by a corporation or labor union.[24]  In response to this line of questioning, Stewart further argued that under Austin the government could ban the digital distribution of political books over the Amazon Kindle or prevent a union from hiring an author to write a political book.[25]\nAccording to a 2012 article in The New Yorker by Jeffrey Toobin, the court expected after oral argument to rule on the narrow question that had originally been presented—Can Citizens United show the film? At the subsequent conference among the justices after oral argument, the vote was 5–4 in favor of Citizens United being allowed to show the film. The justices voted the same as they had in Federal Election Commission v. Wisconsin Right to Life, Inc., a similar 2007 case, with Chief Justice Roberts and Justices Scalia, Kennedy, Thomas and Alito in the majority.[26]\nChief Justice John Roberts wrote the initial opinion of the court, holding that the BCRA allowed the showing of the film. A draft concurring opinion by Justice Kennedy argued that the court could and should have gone much further. The other justices in the majority agreed with Kennedy's reasoning, and convinced Roberts to reassign the writing and allow Kennedy's concurrence to become the majority opinion.[26]\nOn the other side, John Paul Stevens, the most senior justice in the minority, assigned the dissent to David Souter, who announced his retirement from the court while he was working on it. The final draft went beyond critiquing the majority. Toobin described it as \"air[ing] some of the Court's dirty laundry\", writing that Souter's dissent accused Roberts of having manipulated court procedures to reach his desired result—an expansive decision that, Souter claimed, changed decades of election law and ruled on issues neither party to the litigation had presented.[26]\nAccording to Toobin, Roberts agreed to withdraw the opinion and schedule the case for reargument. When he did, the \"Questions Presented\" to the parties were, however, more expansive, touching on the issues Kennedy's opinion had identified. According to Toobin, the eventual result was therefore a foregone conclusion from that point on.[26] Toobin's account has been criticized for drawing conclusions unsupported by the evidence in his article.[27]\nOn June 29, 2009, the last day of the term, the court issued an order directing the parties to re-argue the case on September 9 after briefing whether it might be necessary to overrule Austin and/or McConnell v. Federal Election Commission to decide the case.[28] Justice Stevens noted in his dissent that in its prior motion for summary judgment, Citizens United had abandoned its facial challenge of BCRA §203's constitutionality, with the parties agreeing to the dismissal of the claim.[29]\nJustice Sotomayor sat on the bench for the first time during the second round of oral arguments. This was the first case argued by then-Solicitor General and future Supreme Court Justice Elena Kagan. Former Bush Solicitor General Ted Olson and First Amendment lawyer Floyd Abrams argued for Citizens United, and former Clinton Solicitor General Seth Waxman defended the statute on behalf of various supporters.[30] Legal scholar Erwin Chemerinsky called it \"one of the most important First Amendment cases in years\".[31]\nOn January 21, 2010, the court issued a 5–4 decision in favor of Citizens United that struck down the BCRA's restrictions on independent expenditures from corporate treasuries as violations of the First Amendment.[32]\nFive justices formed the majority and joined an opinion written by Justice Anthony Kennedy. The court found that the BCRA §203 prohibition of all independent expenditures by corporations and unions violated the First Amendment's protection of free speech.[33] The majority wrote, \"If the First Amendment has any force, it prohibits Congress from fining or jailing citizens, or associations of citizens, for simply engaging in political speech.\"[34]\nJustice Kennedy's opinion also noted that because the First Amendment does not distinguish between media and other corporations, the BCRA restrictions improperly allowed Congress to suppress political speech in newspapers, books, television, and blogs.[8] The court overruled Austin, which had held that a state law that prohibited corporations from using treasury money to support or oppose candidates in elections did not violate the First and Fourteenth Amendments. The court also overruled that portion of McConnell that upheld BCRA's restriction of corporate spending on \"electioneering communications\". The court's ruling effectively freed corporations and unions to spend money both on \"electioneering communications\" and to directly advocate for the election or defeat of candidates (although not to contribute directly to candidates or political parties).\nThe majority ruled that the Freedom of the Press clause of the First Amendment protects associations of individuals in addition to individual speakers, and further that the First Amendment does not allow prohibitions of speech based on the identity of the speaker. Corporations, as associations of individuals, therefore have free speech rights under the First Amendment. Because spending money is essential to disseminating speech, as established in Buckley v. Valeo, limiting a corporation's ability to spend money is unconstitutional because it limits the ability of its members to associate effectively and to speak on political issues.\nThe decision overruled Austin because that decision allowed different restrictions on speech-related spending based on corporate identity.  Additionally, the decision said that Austin was based on an \"equality\" rationale—trying to equalize speech between different speakers—that the court had previously rejected as illegitimate under the First Amendment in Buckley. The Michigan statute at issue in Austin had distinguished between corporate and union spending, prohibiting the former while allowing the latter. The Austin court, over the dissent by Justices Scalia, Kennedy, and O'Connor, had held that such distinctions were within the legislature's prerogative. In Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, however, the majority argued that the First Amendment purposefully keeps the government from interfering in the \"marketplace of ideas\" and \"rationing\" speech, and it is not up to the legislatures or the courts to create a sense of \"fairness\" by restricting speech.[33]\nThe majority also criticized Austin's reasoning that the \"distorting effect\" of large corporate expenditures constituted a risk of corruption or the appearance of corruption. Rather, the majority argued that the government had no place in determining whether large expenditures distorted an audience's perceptions, and that the type of \"corruption\" that might justify government controls on spending for speech had to relate to some form of \"quid pro quo\" transaction: \"There is no such thing as too much speech.\"[33]  The public has a right to have access to all information and to determine the reliability and importance of the information. Additionally, the majority did not believe that reliable evidence substantiated the risk of corruption or the appearance of corruption, and so this rationale did not satisfy strict scrutiny.\nThe court's opinion relied heavily on the reasoning and principles of the landmark campaign finance case of Buckley and First National Bank of Boston v. Bellotti, in which the court struck down a broad prohibition against independent expenditures by corporations in ballot initiatives and referenda.[33] Specifically, the court echoed Bellotti's rejection of categories based on a corporation's purpose.  The majority argued that to grant Freedom of the Press protections to media corporations, but not others, presented a host of problems; and so all corporations should be equally protected from expenditure restrictions.\nThe court found that BCRA §§201 and 311, provisions requiring disclosure of the funder, were valid as applied to the movie advertisements and to the movie itself.[33] The majority ruled for the disclosure of the sources of campaign contributions, saying that\nprompt disclosure of expenditures can provide shareholders and citizens with the information needed to hold corporations and elected officials accountable for their positions and supporters. Shareholders can determine whether their corporation's political speech advances the corporation's interest in making profits, and citizens can see whether elected officials are \"in the pocket\" of so-called moneyed interests ... This transparency enables the electorate to make informed decisions and give proper weight to different speakers and messages.[35][36]\nChief Justice Roberts, with whom Justice Alito joined, wrote separately \"to address the important principles of judicial restraint and stare decisis implicated in this case\".[37]\nRoberts wrote to further explain and defend the court's statement that \"there is a difference between judicial restraint and judicial abdication.\"  Roberts explained why the court must sometimes overrule prior decisions. Had prior courts never gone against stare decisis (that is, against precedent), for example, \"segregation would be legal, minimum wage laws would be unconstitutional, and the Government could wiretap ordinary criminal suspects without first obtaining warrants\".  Roberts's concurrence recited a plethora of case law in which the court had ruled against precedent.  Ultimately, Roberts argued that \"stare decisis ... counsels deference to past mistakes, but provides no justification for making new ones\".[37]\nJustice Scalia joined the opinion of the court, and wrote a concurring opinion which Justice Alito joined in full and Justice Thomas joined in part. Scalia addressed Justice Stevens' dissent, specifically with regard to the original understanding of the First Amendment. Scalia wrote that Stevens's dissent was \"in splendid isolation from the text of the First Amendment ... It never shows why 'the freedom of speech' that was the right of Englishmen did not include the freedom to speak in association with other individuals, including association in the corporate form.\"  He further considered the dissent's exploration of the Framers' views about the \"role of corporations in society\" to be misleading, and even if valid, irrelevant to the text. Scalia principally argued that the First Amendment was written in \"terms of speech, not speakers\" and that \"Its text offers no foothold for excluding any category of speaker.\"[38]  Scalia argued that the Free Press clause was originally intended to protect the distribution of written materials and did not only apply to the media specifically.  This understanding supported the majority's contention that the Constitution does not allow the court to separate corporations into media and non-media categories.[33]\nJustice Thomas wrote a separate opinion concurring in all but the upholding of the disclosure provisions. In order to protect the anonymity of contributors to organizations exercising free speech, Thomas would have struck down the reporting requirements of BCRA §201 and §311 as well, rather than allowing them to be challenged only on a case-specific basis. Thomas's primary argument was that anonymous free speech is protected and that making contributor lists public makes the contributors vulnerable to retaliation, citing instances of retaliation against contributors to both sides of a then-recent California voter initiative. Thomas also expressed concern that such retaliation could extend to retaliation by elected officials. Thomas did not consider \"as-applied challenges\" to be sufficient to protect against the threat of retaliation.[39]\nA dissenting opinion by Justice Stevens[40] was joined by Justice Ginsburg, Justice Breyer, and Justice Sotomayor. To emphasize his unhappiness with the majority, Stevens read part of his 90-page dissent from the bench.[41] Stevens concurred in the court's decision to sustain BCRA's disclosure provisions but dissented from the principal holding of the court. He argued that the court's ruling \"threatens to undermine the integrity of elected institutions across the Nation. The path it has taken to reach its outcome will, I fear, do damage to this institution.\" He added: \"A democracy cannot function effectively when its constituent members believe laws are being bought and sold.\"[42]\nStevens also argued that the court addressed a question not raised by the litigants when it found BCRA §203 to be facially unconstitutional, and that the majority \"changed the case to give themselves an opportunity to change the law\".[33] He argued that the majority had expanded the scope beyond the questions presented by the appellant and that therefore a sufficient record for judging the case did not exist. Stevens argued that at a minimum the court should have remanded the case for a fact-finding hearing, and that the majority did not consider other compilations of data, such as the Congressional record for justifying BCRA §203.\nStevens argued that the court had long recognized that to deny Congress the power to safeguard against \"the improper use of money to influence the result [of an election] is to deny to the nation in a vital particular the power of self protection\".[43]  After recognizing that in Buckley v. Valeo the court had struck down portions of a broad prohibition of independent expenditures from any sources, Stevens argued that nevertheless Buckley recognized the legitimacy of \"prophylactic\" measures for limiting campaign spending and found the prevention of \"corruption\" to be a reasonable goal for legislation.  Consequently, Stevens argued that Buckley left the door open for carefully tailored future regulation.[33]  Although the majority echoed many of the arguments in First National Bank of Boston v. Bellotti, Stevens argued that the majority opinion contradicted the reasoning of other campaign finance cases—in particular, Austin v. Michigan State Chamber of Commerce and McConnell v. Federal Election Commission—and found it telling that the majority, when citing such cases, referenced mainly dissenting opinions.\nStevens argued that the majority failed to recognize the possibility for corruption outside strict quid pro quo exchanges.  He referenced facts from a previous BCRA challenge to argue that, even if the exchange of votes for expenditures could not be shown, contributors gain favorable political access from such expenditures.[33] The majority, however, had considered access to be insufficient justification for limiting speech rights.\nStevens responded that in the past, even when striking down a ban on corporate independent expenditures, the court \"never suggested that such quid pro quo debts must take the form of outright vote buying or bribes\" (Bellotti). Buckley, he said, also acknowledged that large independent expenditures present the same dangers as quid pro quo arrangements, although Buckley struck down limits on such independent expenditures. Using the record from a previous BCRA §203 challenge, he argued that independent expenditures were sometimes a factor in gaining political access and concluded that large independent expenditures generate more influence than direct campaign contributions.[33]  Furthermore, Stevens argued that corporations could threaten Representatives and Senators with negative advertising to gain unprecedented leverage. Stevens supported his argument by citing Caperton v. A.T. Massey Coal Co.,[44] where the court held that $3 million in independent expenditures in a judicial race raised sufficient questions about a judge's impartiality to require the judge to recuse himself in a future case involving the spender. Stevens argued that it was contradictory for the majority to ignore the same risks in legislative and executive elections, and argued that the majority opinion would exacerbate the problem presented in Caperton because of the number of states with judicial elections and increased spending in judicial races.\nSecond, Stevens argued that the majority did not place enough emphasis on the need to prevent the \"appearance of corruption\" in elections.  Earlier cases, including Buckley and Bellotti, recognized the importance of public confidence in democracy.  Stevens cited recent data indicating that 80% of the public view corporate independent expenditures as a method used to gain unfair legislative access.[33]  Stevens predicted that if the public believes that corporations dominate elections, disaffected voters will stop participating.\nThird, Stevens argued that the majority's decision failed to recognize the dangers of the corporate form. Austin held that the prevention of corruption, including the distorting influence of a dominant funding source, was a sufficient reason for regulating corporate independent expenditures. In defending Austin, Stevens argued that the unique qualities of corporations and other artificial legal entities made them dangerous to democratic elections. These legal entities, he argued, have perpetual life, the ability to amass large sums of money, limited liability, no ability to vote, no morality, no purpose outside profit-making, and no loyalty. Therefore, he argued, the courts should permit legislatures to regulate corporate participation in the political process.\nLegal entities, Stevens wrote, are not \"We the People\" for whom our Constitution was established.[33] Therefore, he argued, they should not be given speech protections under the First Amendment. The First Amendment, he argued, protects individual self-expression, self-realization and the communication of ideas. Corporate spending is the \"furthest from the core of political expression\" protected by the Constitution, he argued, citing Federal Election Commission v. Beaumont,[45] and corporate spending on politics should be viewed as a business transaction designed by the officers or the boards of directors for no purpose other than profit-making.  Stevens called corporate spending \"more transactional than ideological\".  Stevens also pointed out that any member of a corporation may spend personal money on promoting a campaign because BCRA only prohibited the use of general treasury money.\nStevens critiqued the majority's main argument: the prohibition of spending guards free speech and allows the general public to receive all available information. Citing Austin, Stevens argued that corporations unfairly influence the electoral process with vast sums of money that few individuals can match.[33]  This process, he argued, puts disproportionate focus on supporting this type of speech and gives the impression of widespread acclaim regardless of actual support.\nFifth, Stevens criticized the majority's fear that the government could use BCRA §203 to censor the media. The focus placed on this hypothetical fear made no sense to him because it did not relate to the facts of this case—if the government actually attempted to apply BCRA §203 to the media (and assuming that Citizens United could not constitute media), the court could deal with the problem at that time. Stevens described the majority's supposed protection of the media as nothing more than posturing. According to him, it was the majority's new rule in this case, that prohibited a law from distinguishing between speakers or funding sources. This new rule would be the only reason why media corporations could not be exempted from BCRA §203.\nStevens recognizes that \"[t]he press plays a unique role not only in the text, history, and structure of the First Amendment but also in facilitating public discourse,[40]\" and even grants that the majority \"raised some interesting and difficult questions about Congress' authority to regulate electioneering by the press, and about how to define what constitutes the press.\" In response he forcefully indicates that, in his view, (emphasis in original) \"that [this question of regulating and defining the press] is not the case before us.\"  Stevens opinion expresses his view that the institutional press can be distinguished from other persons and entities that are not the press while the majority opinion viewed \"freedom of the press\" as an activity, applicable to all citizens or groups of citizens seeking to publish views.  However, while Stevens has been interpreted as implying the press clause specifically protects the institutional press it isn't clear from his opinion.  In footnote 62 Stevens does argue that the free press clause demonstrates \"that the drafters of the First Amendment did draw distinctions—explicit distinctions—between types of \"speakers\", or speech outlets or forms\" but the disjunctive form of the sentence doesn't clearly entail that the distinction must have been between types of speakers rather than outlets or forms.[46]\nSixth, Stevens claimed that the majority failed to give proper deference to the legislature.  Stevens predicted that this ruling would restrict the ability of the states to experiment with different methods for decreasing corruption in elections.  According to Stevens, this ruling virtually ended those efforts, \"declaring by fiat\" that people will not \"lose faith in our democracy\".[33] Stevens argued that the majority's view of a self-serving legislature, passing campaign-spending laws to gain an advantage in retaining a seat, coupled with \"strict scrutiny\" of laws, would make it difficult for any campaign finance regulation to be upheld in future cases.\nSeventh, Stevens argued that the majority opinion ignored the rights of shareholders.  A series of cases protects individuals from legally compelled payment of union dues to support political speech.[47]  Because shareholders invest money in corporations, Stevens argued that the law should likewise help to protect shareholders from funding speech that they oppose.  The majority, however, argued that ownership of corporate stock was voluntary and that unhappy shareholders could simply sell off their shares if they did not agree with the corporation's speech. Stevens also argued that  Political Action Committees (PACs), which allow individual members of a corporation to invest money in a separate fund, are an adequate substitute for general corporate speech and better protect shareholder rights. The majority, by contrast, had argued that most corporations are too small and lack the resources and raw number of shareholders and management staff necessary to maintain compliance, accounting and administrative costs of a PAC. In this dispute, the opposing views essentially discussed differing types of entities: Stevens focused his argument on large, publicly held corporations while the justices in the majority, particularly Justice Scalia's concurring opinion, placed an emphasis on small, closely held corporations and non-profits.\nStevens called the majority's faith in \"corporate democracy\" an unrealistic method for a shareholder to oppose political funding.  A derivative suit is slow, inefficient, risky and potentially expensive.  Likewise, shareholder meetings only happen a few times a year, not prior to every decision or transaction.  Rather, the officers and boards control the day-to-day spending, including political spending.  According to Stevens, the shareholders have few options, giving them \"virtually nonexistent\" recourse for opposing a corporation's political spending.[33]  Furthermore, most shareholders use investment intermediaries, such as mutual funds or pensions, and by the time a shareholder may find out about a corporation's political spending and try to object, the damage is done and the shareholder has funded disfavored speech.[48]\nStevens concluded his dissent by writing:\nAt bottom, the Court's opinion is thus a rejection of the common sense of the American people, who have recognized a need to prevent corporations from undermining self government since the founding, and who have fought against the distinctive corrupting potential of corporate electioneering since the days of Theodore Roosevelt. It is a strange time to repudiate that common sense. While American democracy is imperfect, few outside the majority of this Court would have thought its flaws included a dearth of corporate money in politics.[34]\nThe decision was highly controversial and remains a subject of widespread public discussion.[49][50][51][52] There was a wide range of reactions to the case from politicians, academics, attorneys, advocacy groups and journalists.\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, a plaintiff in the earlier related decision McConnell v. FEC, said:[53][54]\nFor too long, some in this country have been deprived of full participation in the political process. With today's monumental decision, the Supreme Court took an important step in the direction of restoring the First Amendment rights of these groups by ruling that the Constitution protects their right to express themselves about political candidates and issues up until Election Day. By previously denying this right, the government was picking winners and losers. Our democracy depends upon free speech, not just for some but for all.\nRepublican campaign consultant Ed Rollins opined that the decision adds transparency to the election process and will make it more competitive.[55]\nCitizens United, the group filing the lawsuit, said, \"Today's U.S. Supreme Court decision allowing Citizens United to air its documentary films and advertisements is a tremendous victory, not only for Citizens United but for every American who desires to participate in the political process.\"[56] During litigation, Citizens United had support from the United States Chamber of Commerce and the National Rifle Association.[57]\nCampaign finance attorney Cleta Mitchell, who had filed an amicus curiae brief on behalf of two advocacy organizations opposing the ban, wrote that \"The Supreme Court has correctly eliminated a constitutionally flawed system that allowed media corporations (e.g., The Washington Post Co.) to freely disseminate their opinions about candidates using corporate treasury funds, while denying that constitutional privilege to Susie's Flower Shop Inc. ... The real victims of the corporate expenditure ban have been nonprofit advocacy organizations across the political spectrum.\"[58]\nHeritage Foundation fellow Hans A. von Spakovsky, a former Republican member of the Federal Election Commission, said \"The Supreme Court has restored a part of the First Amendment that had been unfortunately stolen by Congress and a previously wrongly-decided ruling of the court.\"[59]\nLibertarian Cato Institute analysts John Samples and Ilya Shapiro wrote that restrictions on advertising were based on the idea \"that corporations had so much money that their spending would create vast inequalities in speech that would undermine democracy\". They continued, \"To make campaign spending equal or nearly so, the government would have to force some people or groups to spend less than they wished. And equality of speech is inherently contrary to protecting speech from government restraint, which is ultimately the heart of American conceptions of free speech.\"[60]\nThe American Civil Liberties Union filed an amicus brief that supported the decision,[61] saying that \"section 203 should now be struck down as facially unconstitutional\", though membership was split over the implications of the ruling and its board sent the issue to its special committee on campaign finance for further consideration.[62] On March 27, 2012, the ACLU reaffirmed its stance in support of the Supreme Court's Citizens United ruling.[63]\nBradley A. Smith, professor of law at Capital University Law School, former chairman of the FEC, founder of the Center for Competitive Politics and a leading proponent of deregulation of campaign finance, wrote that the major opponents of political free speech are \"incumbent politicians\" who \"are keen to maintain a chokehold on such speech\". Empowering \"small and midsize corporations—and every incorporated mom-and-pop falafel joint, local firefighters' union, and environmental group—to make its voice heard\" frightens them.[64] In response to statements by President Obama and others that the ruling would allow foreign entities to gain political influence through U.S. subsidiaries, Smith pointed out that the decision did not overturn the ban on political donations by foreign corporations and the prohibition on any involvement by foreign nationals in decisions regarding political spending by U.S. subsidiaries, which are covered by other parts of the law.[65]\nCampaign finance expert Jan Baran, a member of the Commission on Federal Ethics Law Reform, agreed with the decision, writing that \"The history of campaign finance reform is the history of incumbent politicians seeking to muzzle speakers, any speakers, particularly those who might publicly criticize them and their legislation. It is a lot easier to legislate against unions, gun owners, 'fat cat' bankers, health insurance companies and any other industry or 'special interest' group when they can't talk back.\"  Baran further noted that in general conservatives and libertarians praised the ruling's preservation of the First Amendment and freedom of speech, but that liberals and campaign finance reformers criticized it as greatly expanding the role of corporate money in politics.[66]\nAttorney Kenneth Gross, former associate general counsel of the FEC, wrote that corporations relied more on the development of long-term relationships, political action committees and personal contributions, which were not affected by the decision. He held that while trade associations might seek to raise funds and support candidates, corporations which have \"signed on to transparency agreements regarding political spending\" may not be eager to give.[58]\nThe New York Times asked seven academics to opine on how corporate money would reshape politics as a result of the court's decision.[67] Three of the seven wrote that the effects would be minimal or positive: Christopher Cotton, a University of Miami School of Business assistant professor of economics, wrote that \"There may be very little difference between seeing eight ads or seeing nine ads (compared to seeing one ad or two). And, voters recognize that richer candidates are not necessarily the better candidates, and in some cases, the benefit of running more ads is offset by the negative signal that spending a lot of money creates.[67] Eugene Volokh, a professor of law at UCLA, stated that the \"most influential actors in most political campaigns\" are media corporations which \"overtly editorialize for and against candidates, and also influence elections by choosing what to cover and how to cover it\". Holding that corporations like Exxon would fear alienating voters by supporting candidates, the decision really meant that voters would hear \"more messages from more sources\".[67] Joel Gora, a professor at Brooklyn Law School who had previously argued the case of Buckley v. Valeo on behalf of the American Civil Liberties Union, said that the decision represented \"a great day for the First Amendment\" writing that the court had \"dismantled the First Amendment 'caste system' in election speech\".[67]\nThe Editorial Board of the San Antonio Express-News criticized McCain–Feingold's exception for media corporations from the ban on corporate electioneering, writing that it \"makes no sense\" that the paper could make endorsements up until the day of the election but advocacy groups could not. \"While the influence of money on the political process is troubling and sometimes corrupting, abridging political speech is the wrong way to counterbalance that influence.\"[68]\nAnthony Dick in National Review countered a number of arguments against the decision, asking rhetorically, \"is there something uniquely harmful and/or unworthy of protection about political messages that come from corporations and unions, as opposed to, say, rich individuals, persuasive writers, or charismatic demagogues?\" He noted that \"a recent Gallup poll shows that a majority of the public actually agrees with the Court that corporations and unions should be treated just like individuals in terms of their political-expenditure rights\".[69] A Gallup poll taken in October 2009 and released soon after the decision showed 57 percent of those surveyed agreed that contributions to political candidates are a form of free speech and 55 percent agreed that the same rules should apply to individuals, corporations and unions. Sixty-four percent of Democrats and Republicans believed campaign donations are a form of free speech.[70]\nChicago Tribune editorial board member Steve Chapman wrote \"If corporate advocacy may be forbidden as it was under the law in question, it's not just Exxon Mobil and Citigroup that are rendered mute. Nonprofit corporations set up merely to advance goals shared by citizens, such as the American Civil Liberties Union and the National Rifle Association, also have to put a sock in it. So much for the First Amendment goal of fostering debate about public policy.\"[71]\nPresident Barack Obama stated that the decision \"gives the special interests and their lobbyists even more power in Washington—while undermining the influence of average Americans who make small contributions to support their preferred candidates\".[72] Obama later elaborated in his weekly radio address saying, \"this ruling strikes at our democracy itself\" and \"I can't think of anything more devastating to the public interest\".[73] On January 27, 2010, Obama further condemned the decision during the 2010 State of the Union Address, stating that, \"Last week, the Supreme Court reversed a century of law[74] to open the floodgates for special interests—including foreign corporations—to spend without limit in our elections. Well, I don't think American elections should be bankrolled by America's most powerful interests, or worse, by foreign entities.\" On television, the camera shifted to a shot of the SCOTUS judges in the front row directly in front of the President while he was making this statement, and Justice Samuel Alito was frowning, shaking his head side to side while mouthing the words \"Not true\".[75][76][77][78][79]\nDemocratic Senator Russ Feingold, a lead sponsor of the 2002 Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act, stated \"This decision was a terrible mistake. Presented with a relatively narrow legal issue, the Supreme Court chose to roll back laws that have limited the role of corporate money in federal elections since Teddy Roosevelt was president.\"[80] Representative Alan Grayson, a Democrat, stated that it was \"the worst Supreme Court decision since the Dred Scott case, and that the court had opened the door to political bribery and corruption in elections to come.[81] Democratic congresswoman Donna Edwards, along with constitutional law professor and Maryland Democratic State Senator Jamie Raskin, have advocated petitions to reverse the decision by means of constitutional amendment.[82] Rep. Leonard Boswell introduced legislation to amend the constitution.[83] Senator John Kerry also called for an Amendment to overrule the decision.[84] On December 8, 2011, Senator Bernie Sanders proposed the Saving American Democracy Amendment, which would reverse the court's ruling.[85][86]\nRepublican Senator John McCain, co-crafter of the 2002 Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act and the party's 2008 presidential nominee, said \"there's going to be, over time, a backlash ... when you see the amounts of union and corporate money that's going to go into political campaigns\".[87] McCain was \"disappointed by the decision of the Supreme Court and the lifting of the limits on corporate and union contributions\" but not surprised by the decision, saying that \"It was clear that Justice Roberts, Alito and Scalia, by their very skeptical and even sarcastic comments, were very much opposed to BCRA.\"[80] Republican Senator Olympia Snowe opined that \"Today's decision was a serious disservice to our country.\"[88]\nAlthough federal law after Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission still prohibited corporate contributions to all political parties, Sanda Everette, co-chair of the Green Party, stated that \"The ruling especially hurts the ability of parties that don't accept corporate contributions, like the Green Party, to compete.\" Another Green Party officer, Rich Whitney, stated \"In a transparently political decision, a majority of the US Supreme Court overturned its own recent precedent and paid tribute to the giant corporate interests that already wield tremendous power over our political process and political speech.\"\nRalph Nader condemned the ruling,[89] saying that \"With this decision, corporations can now directly pour vast amounts of corporate money, through independent expenditures, into the electoral swamp already flooded with corporate campaign PAC contribution dollars.\" He called for shareholder resolutions asking company directors to pledge not to use company money to favor or oppose electoral candidates.[90] Pat Choate, former Reform Party candidate for Vice President, stated, \"The court has, in effect, legalized foreign governments and foreign corporations to participate in our electoral politics.\"[91]\nSenator Bernie Sanders, a contender in the 2016 Democratic Primary, has filed a constitutional amendment to overturn the Supreme Court's Decision.[92] Further, both Sanders and Hillary Clinton said that, if they were elected, they would only have appointed Supreme Court Justices who were committed to the repeal of Citizens United.[93] In September 2015, Sanders said that \"the foundations of American Democracy are being undermined\" and called for sweeping campaign finance reform.[94] Sanders repeated such calls in the years since.[95][96]\nWhen asked about the April 2014 ruling, former President Jimmy Carter called the United States \"an oligarchy with unlimited political bribery\" in an interview with Thom Hartmann.[97]\nAmbassador Janez Lenarčič, speaking for the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe's Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (which has overseen over 150 elections) said the ruling may adversely affect the organization's two commitments of \"giving voters a genuine choice and giving candidates a fair chance\" in that \"it threatens to further marginalize candidates without strong financial backing or extensive personal resources, thereby in effect narrowing the political arena\".[98]\nMoney isn't speech and corporations aren't people.\nThe constitutional law scholar Laurence H. Tribe wrote that the decision \"marks a major upheaval in First Amendment law and signals the end of whatever legitimate claim could otherwise have been made by the Roberts Court to an incremental and minimalist approach to constitutional adjudication, to a modest view of the judicial role vis-à-vis the political branches, or to a genuine concern with adherence to precedent\" and pointed out, \"Talking about a business corporation as merely another way that individuals might choose to organize their association with one another to pursue their common expressive aims is worse than unrealistic; it obscures the very real injustice and distortion entailed in the phenomenon of some people using other people's money to support candidates they have made no decision to support, or to oppose candidates they have made no decision to oppose.\"[100]\nFormer Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, whose opinions had changed from dissenting in Austin v. Michigan State Chamber of Commerce to co-authoring (with Stevens) the majority opinion in McConnell v. Federal Election Commission twelve years later, criticized the decision only obliquely, but warned, \"In invalidating some of the existing checks on campaign spending, the majority in Citizens United has signaled that the problem of campaign contributions in judicial elections might get considerably worse and quite soon.\"[101]\nRichard L. Hasen, professor of election law at Loyola Law School, argued that the ruling \"is activist, it increases the dangers of corruption in our political system and it ignores the strong tradition of American political equality\". He also described Justice Kennedy's \"specter of blog censorship\" as sounding more like \"the rantings of a right-wing talk show host than the rational view of a justice with a sense of political realism\".[102]\nKathleen M. Sullivan, professor at Stanford Law School and Steven J. Andre, adjunct professor at Lincoln Law School, argued that two different visions of freedom of speech exist and clashed in the case.  An egalitarian vision skeptical of the power of large agglomerations of wealth to skew the political process conflicted with a libertarian vision skeptical of government being placed in the role of determining what speech people should or should not hear.[103][104] Wayne Batchis, Professor at the University of Delaware, in contrast, argues that the Citizens United decision represents a misguided interpretation of the non-textual freedom of association.[105]\nThe four other scholars of the seven writing in the aforementioned The New York Times article were critical.[67] Richard L. Hasen, Distinguished Professor of election law at Loyola Law School argued differently from his Slate article above, concentrating on the \"inherent risk of corruption that comes when someone spends independently to try to influence the outcome of judicial elections\", since judges are less publicly accountable than elected officials. Heather K. Gerken, Professor of Law at Yale Law School wrote that \"The court has done real damage to the cause of reform, but that damage mostly came earlier, with decisions that made less of a splash.\" Michael Waldman, director of the Brennan Center for Justice at N.Y.U. School of Law, opined that the decision \"matches or exceeds Bush v. Gore in ideological or partisan overreaching by the court\", explaining how \"Exxon or any other firm could spend Bloomberg-level sums in any congressional district in the country against, say, any congressman who supports climate change legislation, or health care, etc.\" and Fred Wertheimer, founder and president of Democracy 21 considered that \"Chief Justice Roberts has abandoned the illusory public commitments he made to 'judicial modesty' and 'respect for precedent' to cast the deciding vote for a radical decision that profoundly undermines our democracy\", and that \"Congress and presidents past have recognized this danger and signed numerous laws over the years to prevent this kind of corruption of our government.\"[67]\nIn a Time magazine survey of over 50 law professors, Richard Delgado (University of Alabama), Cass Sunstein (Harvard), and Jenny Martinez (Stanford) all listed Citizens United as the \"worst Supreme Court decision since 1960\", with Sunstein noting that the decision is \"undermining our system of democracy itself.\"[106]\nThe New York Times stated in an editorial, \"The Supreme Court has handed lobbyists a new weapon. A lobbyist can now tell any elected official: if you vote wrong, my company, labor union or interest group will spend unlimited sums explicitly advertising against your re-election.\"[107] Jonathan Alter called it the \"most serious threat to American democracy in a generation\".[108] The Christian Science Monitor wrote that the court had declared \"outright that corporate expenditures cannot corrupt elected officials, that influence over lawmakers is not corruption, and that appearance of influence will not undermine public faith in our democracy\".[109]\nIn 2012, Ben Cohen, the co-founder of Ben & Jerry's ice cream, founded Stamp Stampede, a sustained protest to demonstrate widespread support for a proposed constitutional amendment to overturn Citizens United. The campaign encourages people to rubber stamp messages such as \"Not To Be Used for Bribing Politicians\" on paper currency. In 2014, Cohen told Salon, \"As long as the Supreme Court rules money is speech, corporations and the wealthy are using it by giving piles of it to politicians to pass or not pass laws that they want. Now, the rest of the people, [those] who don't have that money, can actually make their voice heard by using money to stamp a message out.\"[110]\nMost blogs avoided the theoretical aspects of the decision and focused on more personal and dramatic elements, including the Barack Obama–Samuel Alito face-off during the President's State of the Union address.[111] There, President Obama argued that the decision \"reversed a century of law\" (the federal ban on corporate contributions dates back to the 1907 Tillman Act, and the ban on union and corporate expenditures dates from 1947) and that it would allow \"foreign corporations to spend without limits in our elections\", during which Justice Alito, in the audience, perceptibly mouthed the words \"not true\". This event received extensive comment from political bloggers, with a substantial amount of the coverage concentrated on whether or not foreign corporations would be able to make substantial political contributions in US elections. In the opinion, the court had specifically indicated it was not overturning the ban on foreign contributions.\nAn ABC–The Washington Post poll conducted February 4–8, 2010, showed that 80% of those surveyed opposed (and 65% strongly opposed) the Citizens United ruling, which the poll described as saying \"corporations and unions can spend as much money as they want to help political candidates win elections\". Additionally, 72% supported \"an effort by Congress to reinstate limits on corporate and union spending on election campaigns\". The poll showed large majority support from Democrats, Republicans and independents.[112][113][114]\nA Gallup Poll conducted in October 2009, after oral argument, but released after the Supreme Court released its opinion, found that 57 percent of those surveyed \"agreed that money given to political candidates is a form of free speech\" and 55 percent agreed that the \"same rules should apply to individuals, corporations and unions\". In the same poll, however, respondents by 52% to 41% prioritized limits on campaign contributions over protecting rights to support campaigns and 76% thought the government should be able to place limits on corporation or union donations.[115][116]\nSeparate polls by various conservative organizations, including the plaintiff Citizens United and the Center for Competitive Politics, found support for the decision.[117] In particular, the Center for Competitive Politics poll[118] found that 51% of respondents believed that Citizens United should have a right to air ads promoting Hillary: The Movie. The poll also found that only 22 percent had heard of the case.\nPolling conducted by Ipsos in August 2017 found that 48% of Americans oppose the decision and 30% support it, with the remainder having no opinion. It also found that 57% percent of Americans favored \"limits on the amount of money super PACs can raise and spend\".[119]\nSpeechNow is a nonprofit, unincorporated association organized as a section 527 entity under the U.S. Internal Revenue Code. The organization was formed by individuals who seek to pool their resources to make independent expenditures expressly advocating the election or defeat of federal candidates. SpeechNow planned to accept contributions only from individuals, not corporations or other sources prohibited under the Federal Election Campaign Act. On February 14, 2008, SpeechNow and several individual plaintiffs filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia challenging the constitutionality of the Federal Election Campaign Act provisions governing political committee registration, contribution limits and disclosure. The plaintiffs contended that the Act unconstitutionally restricts their association guaranteed under the First Amendment. By requiring registration as a political committee and limiting the monetary amount that an individual may contribute to a political committee, SpeechNow and the other plaintiffs asserted that the Act unconstitutionally restricted the individuals' freedom of speech by limiting the amount that an individual can contribute to SpeechNow and thus the amount the organization may spend. SpeechNow also argued that the reporting required of political committees is unconstitutionally burdensome.[120]\nOn March 26, 2010, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled in SpeechNow.org. v. FEC that the contribution limits of 2 U.S.C. §441a were unconstitutional as applied to individuals' contributions to SpeechNow. The court also ruled that the reporting requirements of 2 U.S.C. §§432, 433 and 434(a) and the organizational requirements of 2 U.S.C. §431(4) and §431(8) can be constitutionally applied to SpeechNow.[120] A unanimous nine-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals[121] struck down the federal limits on contributions to federal political committees that make only independent expenditures and do not contribute to candidates or political parties. This type of \"independent expenditure committee\" is inherently non-corruptive, the court reasoned, and therefore contributions to such a committee can not be limited based on the government's interest in preventing political corruption.[122] In light of the Supreme Court's decision in Citizens United v. FEC, in which the Supreme Court held that the government has no anti-corruption interest in limiting independent expenditures, the appeals court ruled that \"contributions to groups that make only independent expenditures cannot corrupt or create the appearance of corruption.\" As a result, the court of appeals held that the government has no anti-corruption interest in limiting contributions to an independent group such as SpeechNow. Contribution limits as applied to SpeechNow \"violate the First Amendment by preventing [individuals] from donating to SpeechNow in excess of the limits and by prohibiting SpeechNow from accepting donations in excess of the limits.\" The court noted that its holding does not affect direct contributions to candidates, but rather contributions to a group that makes only independent expenditures.[120] The appeals court held that, while disclosure and reporting requirements do impose a burden on First Amendment interests, they \"'impose no ceiling on campaign related activities'\" and \"'do not prevent anyone from speaking.'\" Furthermore, the court held that the additional reporting requirements that the Commission would impose on SpeechNow if it were organized as a political committee are minimal, \"given the relative simplicity with which SpeechNow intends to operate.\" Since SpeechNow already had a number of \"planned contributions\" from individuals, the court ruled that SpeechNow could not compare itself to \"ad hoc groups that want to create themselves on the spur of the moment.\" Since the public has an interest in knowing who is speaking about a candidate and who is funding that speech, the court held that requiring such disclosure and organization as a political committee are sufficiently important governmental interests to justify the additional reporting and registration burdens on SpeechNow.[120]\nOn June 27, 2011, ruling in the consolidated cases of Arizona Free Enterprise Club's Freedom Club PAC v. Bennett (No. 10-238) and McComish v. Bennett (No. 10-239), the Supreme Court deemed unconstitutional an Arizona law that provided extra taxpayer-funded support for office seekers who have been outspent by privately funded opponents or by independent political groups. A conservative 5–4 majority of justices said the law violated free speech, concluding the state was impermissibly trying to \"level the playing field\" through a public finance system. Arizona lawmakers had argued there was a compelling state interest in equalizing resources among competing candidates and interest groups.[123] Opponents said the law violated free-speech rights of the privately financed candidates and their contributors, inhibiting fundraising and spending, discouraging participation in campaigns and limiting what voters hear about politics.[124] Chief Justice John Roberts said in the court's majority opinion that the law substantially burdened political speech and was not sufficiently justified to survive First Amendment scrutiny.[124]\nAs a consequence of the decision, states and municipalities are blocked from using a method of public financing that is simultaneously likely to attract candidates fearful they will be vastly outspent and sensitive to avoiding needless government expense. \"The government can still use taxpayer funds to subsidize political campaigns, but it can only do that in a manner that provides an alternative to private financing\" said William R. Maurer, a lawyer with Institute for Justice, which represented several challengers of the law. \"It cannot create disincentives.\"[125] The ruling meant the end of similar matching-fund programs in Connecticut, Maine and a few other places according to David Primo, a political science professor at University of Rochester who was an expert witness for the law's challengers.[126]\nDespite the Citizens United ruling, in December 2011, the Montana Supreme Court, in Western Tradition Partnership, Inc. v. Attorney General of Montana, upheld that state's law limiting corporate contributions. Examining the history of corporate interference in Montana government that led to the Corrupt Practices Law, the majority decided that the state still had a compelling reason to maintain the restrictions. It ruled that these restrictions on speech were narrowly tailored and withstood strict scrutiny and thus did not contradict Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission.\nWhile granting permission to file a certiorari petition, the US Supreme Court agreed to stay the Montana ruling, although Justices Ginsburg and Breyer wrote a short statement urging the court \"to consider whether, in light of the huge sums of money currently deployed to buy candidate's allegiance, Citizens United should continue to hold sway\".[127] In June 2012, over the dissent of the same four judges who dissented in Citizens United, the court simultaneously granted certiorari and summarily reversed the decision in American Tradition Partnership, Inc. v. Bullock, 567, U.S. __ (2012).[128] The Supreme Court majority rejected the Montana Supreme Court arguments in a two paragraph, twenty line per curiam opinion, stating that these arguments \"either were already rejected in Citizens United, or fail to meaningfully distinguish that case.\"[129] The ruling makes clear that states cannot bar corporate and union political expenditures in state elections.[130]\nIn addition to limiting the size of donations to individual candidates and parties, the Federal Election Campaign Act also includes aggregate caps on the total amount that an individual may give to all candidates and parties. In 2012, Shaun McCutcheon, a Republican Party activist,[131][132] sought to donate more than was allowed by the federal aggregate limit on federal candidates.[133] McCutcheon et al filed suit against the Federal Election Commission (FEC).[134] In 2014, the US Supreme Court reversed a ruling of the DC District Court's dismissal of McCutcheon v. FEC and struck down the aggregate limits. The plurality opinion invalidated only the aggregate contribution limits, not limits on giving to any one candidate or party. The decisive fifth vote for McCutcheon came from Justice Thomas, who wrote a concurring opinion stating that all contribution limits are unconstitutional.[135]\nThe New York Times reported that 24 states with laws prohibiting or limiting independent expenditures by unions and corporations would have to change their campaign finance laws because of the ruling.[136]\nAfter Citizens United and SpeechNow.org numerous state legislatures raised their limits on contributions to candidates and parties.[137] At the federal level, lawmakers substantially increased contribution limits to political parties as part of the 2014 budget bill.[138] Such changes are widely perceived as efforts to place candidates and parties on something closer to equal footing with organizations making independent expenditures.[138]\nWhile many states and the federal government have raised contribution limits in response to Citizens United, proposals aimed at discouraging political spending, or providing for public financing of campaigns, have been less successful.\nSenator Dick Durbin (D-IL) proposed that candidates who sign up small donors receive $900,000 in public money, but the proposal has not been acted on by Congress. Others proposed that laws on corporate governance be amended to assure that shareholders vote on political expenditures.[108]\nIn February 2010, Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York, immediate past Chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, and Representative Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, Chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, outlined legislation aimed at undoing the decision.[139]  In April 2010, they introduced such legislation in the Senate and House, respectively.[140] On June 24, 2010, H.R.5175 (The DISCLOSE Act) passed in the House of Representatives but failed in the Senate. It would have required additional disclosure by corporations of their campaign expenditures.  The law, if passed, would also have prohibited political spending by U.S. companies with twenty percent or more foreign ownership, and by most government contractors.[141] The DISCLOSE Act included exemptions to its rules given to certain special interests such as the National Rifle Association and the American Association of Retired Persons. These gaps within the proposal attracted criticism from lawmakers on both political parties. \"They are auctioning off pieces of the First Amendment in this bill ... The bigger you are, the stronger you are, the less disclosure you have\", said Republican Congressman Dan Lungren of California. Democratic Congressman Adam Schiff of California commented, \"I wish there had been no carve-outs\".[142]\nThe bill was criticized as prohibiting much activity that was legal before Citizens United.[143]\nThe DISCLOSE Act twice failed to pass the U.S. Senate in the 111th Congress, in both instances reaching only 59 of the 60 votes required to overcome a unified Republican filibuster.[144][145] A scaled down version of the DISCLOSE Act was reintroduced in both the House and Senate in 2012 but did not pass.[citation needed]\nSome have argued for a constitutional amendment to overturn the decision. Although the decision does not address \"corporate personhood\", a long-established judicial and constitutional concept,[146] much attention has focused on that issue. Move to Amend, a coalition formed in response to the ruling,[147] seeks to amend the Constitution to abolish corporate personhood, thus stripping corporations of all rights under the Constitution.[148][149] In an online chat with web community Reddit, President Obama endorsed further consideration of a constitutional amendment and stated \"Over the longer term, I think we need to seriously consider mobilizing a constitutional amendment process to overturn Citizens United (assuming the Supreme Court doesn't revisit it)\".[150] He further elaborated that \"Even if the amendment process falls short, it can shine a spotlight on the super-PAC phenomenon and help apply pressure for change.\"[150]\nMembers of 16 state legislatures have called for a constitutional amendment to reverse the court's decision: California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Montana, New Jersey, New Mexico, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, and West Virginia.[151]\nMost of these are non-binding resolutions, but three states—Vermont, California, and Illinois—called for an Article V Convention to draft and propose a federal constitutional amendment to overturn Citizens United.[152]  In Minnesota, the Minnesota Senate passed a similar resolution, \"Senate File No. 17\", on May 2, 2013, but the House of Representatives returned the measure to the General Calendar (meaning the measure did not pass) on May 15, 2013.[153] Thirty-four states are needed to call an Article V convention.\nOn a local level, Washington D.C. and 400 other municipalities passed resolutions requesting a federal constitutional amendment.[154]\nSince Citizens United, however, 13 states have actually raised their contribution limits.[137]\nCritics predicted that the ruling would \"bring about a new era of corporate influence in politics\", allowing companies and businesspeople to \"buy elections\" to promote their financial interests. Instead, large expenditures, usually through \"Super PACS\", have come from \"a small group of billionaires\", based largely on ideology. This has shifted power \"away from the political parties and toward the ... donors themselves. In part, this explains the large number and variety of candidates fielded by the Republicans in 2016.\"[155]\nAccording to a 2021 study, the ruling weakened political parties while strengthening single-issue advocacy groups and Super PACs funded by billionaires with pet issues. The ruling made it easier for self-promoting politicians to undermine political processes and democratic norms to promote themselves.[156]\nCitizens United v. Federal Election Commission has often been credited for the creation of \"super PACs\", political action committees which make no financial contributions to candidates or parties, and so can accept unlimited contributions from individuals, corporations and unions. Certainly, the holding in Citizens United helped affirm the legal basis for super PACs by deciding that, for purposes of establishing a \"compelling government interest\" of corruption sufficient to justify government limitations on political speech, \"independent expenditures, including those made by corporations, do not give rise to corruption or the appearance of corruption\".[157]\nIt took another decision, by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, Speechnow.org v. Federal Election Commission, to actually authorize the creation of super PACs. While Citizens United held that corporations and unions could make independent expenditures, a separate provision of the Federal Election Campaign Act, at least as long interpreted by the Federal Election Commission, held that individuals could not contribute to a common fund without it becoming a PAC. PACs, in turn, were not allowed to accept corporate or union contributions of any size or to accept individual contributions in excess of $5,000. In Speechnow.org, the D.C. Circuit, sitting en banc, held 9–0 that in light of Citizens United, such restrictions on the sources and size of contributions could not apply to an organization that made only independent expenditures in support of or opposition to a candidate but not contributions to a candidate's campaign.\nCitizens United and SpeechNOW left their imprint on the 2012 United States presidential election, in which single individuals contributed large sums to \"super PACs\" supporting particular candidates. Sheldon Adelson, the gambling entrepreneur, gave approximately fifteen million dollars to support Newt Gingrich. Foster Friess, a Wyoming financier, donated almost two million dollars to Rick Santorum's super PAC. Karl Rove organized super PACs that spent over $300 million in support of Republicans during the 2012 elections.[158]\nIn addition to indirectly providing support for the creation of super PACs, Citizens United allowed incorporated 501(c)(4) public advocacy groups (such as the National Rifle Association, the Sierra Club, and the group Citizens United itself) and trade associations to make expenditures in political races. Such groups may not, under the tax code, have a primary purpose of engaging in electoral advocacy. These organizations must disclose their expenditures, but unlike super PACs they do not have to include the names of their donors in their FEC filings. A number of partisan organizations such as Karl Rove's influential conservative Crossroads Grassroots Policy Strategies and the liberal 21st Century Colorado have since registered as tax-exempt 501(c)(4) groups (defined as groups promoting \"social welfare\") and engaged in substantial political spending.[159][160] This has led to claims[161][162][163] of large secret donations,[51][164] and questions about whether such groups should be required to disclose their donors. Historically, such non-profits have not been required to disclose their donors or names of members. See National Association for the Advancement of Colored People v. Alabama.\nIn an August 2015 essay in Der Spiegel, Markus Feldkirchen wrote that the Citizens United decision was \"now becoming visible for the first time\" in federal elections as the super-rich have \"radically\" increased donations to support their candidates and positions via super PACs. Feldkirchen also said in the first six months of 2015 the candidates and their super PACs received close to $400 million: \"far more than in the entire previous campaign\". He opined that super-rich donating more than ever before to individual campaigns plus the \"enormous\" chasm in wealth has given the super-rich the power to steer the economic and political direction of the United States and undermine its democracy.[165] In October 2015, The New York Times observed that just 158 super-rich families each contributed $250,000 or more, while an additional 200 families gave more than $100,000 for the 2016 presidential election. Both groups contributed almost half of the \"early money\" for candidates in the 2016 presidential election as of June 30, 2015 through channels like super PACs legalized by the Supreme Court's Citizens United decision.[166][167]\nAt least in the Republican Party, the Citizens United ruling has weakened the fund raising power of the Republican \"establishment\" in the form of the \"three major\" Republican campaign committees (Republican National Committee, National Republican Congressional Committee, National Republican Senatorial Committee).[168] Columnist Thomas B. Edsall notes that in 2008, \"the last election before the Citizens United decision\", the three campaign committees \"raised six times\" the money that \"nonparty conservative organizations\" did—$657.6 million vs. $111.9 million. By 2016 those party committees raised less than the independent groups—$652.4 million v. $810.4 million. Thus the new funding \"freed candidates to defy\" the party establishment, although not, it seems, to move policy making away from traditional Republican priorities.[168]\nStudies have shown that the Citizens United ruling gave Republicans an advantage in subsequent elections. One study by political scientists at University of Chicago, Columbia University and the London School of Economics found \"that Citizens United increased the GOP's average seat share in the state legislature by five percentage points. That is a large effect—large enough that, were it applied to the past twelve Congresses, partisan control of the House would have switched eight times. In line with a previous study, we also find that the vote share of Republican candidates increased three to four points, on average.\"[169][170] A 2016 study in the Journal of Law and Economics found \"that Citizens United is associated with an increase in Republicans' election probabilities in state house races of approximately 4 percentage points overall and 10 or more percentage points in several states. We link these estimates to on-the-ground evidence of significant spending by corporations through channels enabled by Citizens United.\"[5] According to a 2020 study, the ruling boosted the electoral success of Republican candidates.[6]",

            "report_content": "Sonia Maria Sotomayor  (Spanish: [ˈsonja sotomaˈʝoɾ];[1] born June 25, 1954)[2] is an associate justice of the Supreme Court of the United States. She was nominated by President Barack Obama on May 26, 2009 and has served since August 8, 2009. She is the third woman to hold the position. Sotomayor is the first woman of color, first Hispanic, and first Latina member of the Court.[3][a]\nSotomayor was born in The Bronx, New York City,[4] to Puerto Rican-born parents. Her father died when she was nine, and she was subsequently raised by her mother. Sotomayor graduated summa cum laude from Princeton University in 1976 and received her Juris Doctor from Yale Law School in 1979, where she was an editor at the Yale Law Journal.[4] She worked as an assistant district attorney in New York for four and a half years before entering private practice in 1984. She played an active role on the boards of directors for the Puerto Rican Legal Defense and Education Fund, the State of New York Mortgage Agency, and the New York City Campaign Finance Board.\nSotomayor was nominated to the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York by President George H. W. Bush in 1991; confirmation followed in 1992. In 1997, she was nominated by President Bill Clinton to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. Her nomination was slowed by the Republican majority in the United States Senate, but she was eventually confirmed in 1998. On the Second Circuit, Sotomayor heard appeals in more than 3,000 cases and wrote about 380 opinions.[citation needed] Sotomayor has taught at the New York University School of Law and Columbia Law School.\nIn May 2009, President Barack Obama nominated Sotomayor to the Supreme Court following the retirement of Justice David Souter. Her nomination was confirmed by the Senate in August 2009 by a vote of 68–31. While on the court, Sotomayor has supported the informal liberal bloc of justices when they divide along the commonly perceived ideological lines. During her tenure on the Supreme Court, Sotomayor has been identified with concern for the rights of defendants, calls for reform of the criminal justice system, and making impassioned dissents on issues of race, gender and ethnic identity, including Schuette v. BAMN, Utah v. Strieff, and Trump v. Hawaii.\nSotomayor[5] was born in the New York City borough of The Bronx.[6] Her father was Juan Sotomayor (born c. 1921-1964),[7] from the area of Santurce, San Juan, Puerto Rico,[8][9][10] and her mother was Celina Báez (1927-2021),[11] an orphan[12] from the neighborhood of Santa Rosa in Lajas, a rural area on Puerto Rico's southwest coast.[10]\nThe two left Puerto Rico separately, met, and married during World War II after Celina served in the Women's Army Corps.[13][14] Juan Sotomayor had a third-grade education, did not speak English, and worked as a tool and die worker;[8] Celina Baez worked as a telephone operator and then a practical nurse.[7] Sonia's younger brother, Juan Sotomayor (born c. 1957), later became a physician and university professor in the Syracuse, New York, area.[15][16]\nSotomayor was raised a Catholic[3] and grew up in Puerto Rican communities in the South Bronx and East Bronx; she self-identifies as a \"Nuyorican\".[13]  The family lived in a South Bronx tenement[17]  before moving in 1957 to the well-maintained, racially and ethnically mixed, working-class Bronxdale Houses housing project[17][18][19] in Soundview (which has over time been thought as part of both the East Bronx and South Bronx).[20][21][22] Her relative proximity to Yankee Stadium led to her becoming a lifelong fan of the New York Yankees.[23]  The extended family got together frequently[17] and regularly visited Puerto Rico during summers.[24]\nSonia grew up with an alcoholic father and a mother who was emotionally distant; she felt closest to her grandmother, who she later said gave her a source of \"protection and purpose\".[12]\nSonia was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes at age seven,[8] and began taking daily insulin injections.[25] Her father died of heart problems at age 42, when she was nine years old.[7][17] After this, she became fluent in English.[8] Sotomayor has said that she was first inspired by the strong-willed Nancy Drew book character, and then after her diabetes diagnosis led doctors to suggest a different career from detective, she was inspired to go into a legal career and become a judge by watching the Perry Mason television series.[8][23][25]  She reflected in 1998: \"I was going to college and I was going to become an attorney, and I knew that when I was ten. Ten. That's no jest.\"[23]\nCelina Sotomayor put great stress on the value of education; she bought the Encyclopædia Britannica for her children, something unusual in the housing projects.[13] Despite the distance between the two, which became greater after her father's death and which was not fully reconciled until decades later,[12] Sotomayor has credited her mother with being her \"life inspiration\".[26] For grammar school, Sotomayor attended Blessed Sacrament School in Soundview,[27] where she was valedictorian and had a near-perfect attendance record.[22][28] Although underage, Sotomayor worked at a local retail store and a hospital.[29] Sotomayor passed the entrance tests for and then attended Cardinal Spellman High School in the Bronx.[3][30] At Cardinal Spellman, Sotomayor was on the forensics team and was elected to the student government.[3][30] She graduated as valedictorian in 1972.[13]  Meanwhile, the Bronxdale Houses had fallen victim to increasing heroin use, crime, and the emergence of the Black Spades gang.[17]  In 1970, the family found refuge by moving to Co-op City in the Northeast Bronx.[17]\nSotomayor entered Princeton University on a full scholarship,[31] by her own later description gaining admission in part due to her achievements in high school and in part because affirmative action made up for her standardized test scores not being fully comparable to those of other applicants.[32][33]  She would later say that there are cultural biases built into such testing[32] and praise affirmative action for fulfilling \"its purpose: to create the conditions whereby students from disadvantaged backgrounds could be brought to the starting line of a race many were unaware was even being run.\"[34]\nShe would describe her time at Princeton as a life-changing experience.[35] Initially, she felt like \"a visitor landing in an alien country\"[36] as her exposure had been limited to the Bronx and Puerto Rico.[37] Princeton had few women students and fewer Latinos (about 20).[13][38] She was too intimidated to ask questions during her freshman year;[36] her writing and vocabulary skills were weak, and she lacked knowledge in the classics.[39] She put in long hours in the library and over summers, worked with a professor outside of class, and gained skills, knowledge, and confidence.[13][38][39] She became a moderate student activist[30][40] and co-chair of the Acción Puertorriqueña organization, which served as a social and political hub and sought more opportunities for Puerto Rican students.[13][41][42] She worked in the admissions office, traveling to high schools and lobbying on behalf of her best prospects.[43]\nAs an activist, Sotomayor focused on faculty hiring and curriculum, since Princeton did not have a single full-time Latino professor nor any class on Latin American studies.[44][45]  A meeting with university president William G. Bowen in her sophomore year saw no results,[42] leading to Sotomayor's saying in a New York Times story at the time that \"Princeton is following a policy of benign neutrality and is not making substantive efforts to change.\"[46] So, Acción Puertorriqueña filed a formal letter of complaint in April 1974 with the Department of Health, Education and Welfare, saying the school discriminated in its hiring and admission practices.[41][44][46] Sotomayor wrote opinion pieces for the Daily Princetonian with the same theme.[13] The university began to hire Latino faculty,[40][44] and Sotomayor established an ongoing dialogue with Bowen.[43]  Sotomayor also successfully persuaded historian Peter Winn to create a seminar on Puerto Rican history and politics.[44] Sotomayor joined the governance board of Princeton's Third World Center and served on the university's student–faculty Discipline Committee, which issued rulings on student infractions.[43][47] She also ran an after-school program for local children[40] and volunteered as an interpreter for Latino patients at Trenton Psychiatric Hospital.[13][37][48]\nAcademically, Sotomayor stumbled her first year at Princeton,[37] but later received almost all A's in her final two years of college.[47] Sotomayor wrote her senior thesis at Princeton on Luis Muñoz Marín, the first democratically elected governor of Puerto Rico, and on the territory's struggles for economic and political self-determination.[13] The 178-page work, \"La Historia Ciclica de Puerto Rico: The Impact of the Life of Luis Muñoz Marin on the Political and Economic History of Puerto Rico, 1930–1975\",[49] won honorable mention for the Latin American Studies Thesis Prize.[50] As a senior, Sotomayor won the Pyne Prize, the top award for undergraduates, which reflected both strong grades and extracurricular activities.[13][30][47] In 1976, she was elected to Phi Beta Kappa[13][51] and graduated summa cum laude with an A.B. in history.[52] She was influenced by critical race theory, which would be reflected in her later speeches and writings.[53]\nOn August 14, 1976, just after graduating from Princeton, Sotomayor married Kevin Edward Noonan, whom she had dated since high school,[9][13] in a small chapel at St. Patrick's Cathedral in New York.[3] She used the married name Sonia Sotomayor de Noonan.[54][55][56]  He became a biologist and a patent lawyer.[13]\nSotomayor entered Yale Law School in the fall of 1976, once more on a scholarship.[23] While she believes she again benefited from affirmative action to compensate for somewhat lower standardized test scores,[32][33] a former dean of admissions at Yale has said that given her record at Princeton, it probably had little effect.[43] At Yale she fit in well[18][55] although she found there were again few Latino students.[42] She was known as a hard worker but she was not considered among the star students in her class.[18][55] Yale General Counsel and professor José A. Cabranes acted as an early mentor to her to successfully transition and work within \"the system\".[57]  She became an editor of the Yale Law Journal[9] and was also managing editor of the student-run Yale Studies in World Public Order publication (later known as the Yale Journal of International Law).[58]  Sotomayor published a law review note on the effect of possible Puerto Rican statehood on the island's mineral and ocean rights.[13][30] She was a semi-finalist in the Barristers Union mock trial competition.[58]  She was co-chair of a group for Latin, Asian, and Native American students, and her advocacy to hire more Hispanic faculty was renewed.[38][42]\nFollowing her second year, she gained a job as a summer associate with the prominent New York law firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison.[59] By her own later evaluation, her performance there was lacking.[60] She did not receive an offer for a full-time position, an experience that she later described as a \"kick in the teeth\" and one that would bother her for years.[59][60] In her third year, she filed a formal complaint against the established Washington, D.C., law firm of Shaw, Pittman, Potts & Trowbridge for suggesting during a recruiting dinner that she was at Yale only via affirmative action.[30][42] Sotomayor refused to be interviewed by the firm further and filed her complaint with a faculty–student tribunal, which ruled in her favor.[42][44] Her action triggered a campus-wide debate,[57] and news of the firm's subsequent December 1978 apology made The Washington Post.[54]\nIn 1979, Sotomayor was awarded a Juris Doctor from Yale Law School.[9] She was admitted to the New York Bar the following year.[56][61]\nOn the recommendation of Cabranes, Sotomayor was hired out of law school as an assistant district attorney under New York County District Attorney Robert Morgenthau starting in 1979.[9][57]  She said at the time that she did so with conflicted emotions: \"There was a tremendous amount of pressure from my community, from the third world community, at Yale. They could not understand why I was taking this job. I'm not sure I've ever resolved that problem.\"[62]  It was a time of crisis-level crime rates and drug problems in New York, Morgenthau's staff was overburdened with cases, and like other rookie prosecutors, Sotomayor was initially fearful of appearing before judges in court.[63] Working in the trial division,[64] she handled heavy caseloads as she prosecuted everything from shoplifting and prostitution to robberies, assaults, and murders.[9][13][65] She also worked on cases involving police brutality.[31] She was not afraid to venture into tough neighborhoods or endure squalid conditions in order to interview witnesses.[65][66] In the courtroom, she was effective at cross examination and at simplifying a case in ways to which a jury could relate.[65] In 1983, she helped convict Richard Maddicks (known as the \"Tarzan Murderer\" who acrobatically entered apartments, robbed them, and shot residents for no reason).[63][67] She felt lower-level crimes were largely products of socioeconomic environment and poverty, but she had a different attitude about serious felonies: \"No matter how liberal I am, I'm still outraged by crimes of violence. Regardless of whether I can sympathize with the causes that lead these individuals to do these crimes, the effects are outrageous.\"[62] Hispanic-on-Hispanic crime was of particular concern to her: \"The saddest crimes for me were the ones that my own people committed against each other.\"[8] In general, she showed a passion for bringing law and order to the streets of New York, displaying special zeal in pursuing child pornography cases, unusual for the time.[30] She worked 15-hour days and gained a reputation for being driven and for her preparedness and fairness.[23][63][68] One of her job evaluations labelled her a \"potential superstar\".[66] Morgenthau later described her as \"smart, hard-working, [and having] a lot of common sense,\"[69] and as a \"fearless and effective prosecutor.\"[31] She stayed a typical length of time in the post[62] and had a common reaction to the job: \"After a while, you forget there are decent, law-abiding people in life.\"[70]\nSotomayor and Noonan divorced amicably in 1983;[66] they did not have children.[21] She has said that the pressures of her working life were a contributing factor, but not the major factor, in the breakup.[68][71] From 1983 to 1986, Sotomayor had an informal solo practice, dubbed Sotomayor & Associates, located in her Brooklyn apartment.[72] She performed legal consulting work, often for friends or family members.[72]\nIn 1984, she entered private practice, joining the commercial litigation practice group of Pavia & Harcourt in Manhattan as an associate.[8][73] One of 30 attorneys in the law firm,[73] she specialized in intellectual property litigation, international law, and arbitration.[8][31][74][75] She later said, \"I wanted to complete myself as an attorney.\"[23] Although she had no civil litigation experience, the firm recruited her heavily, and she learned quickly on the job.[73] She was eager to try cases and argue in court, rather than be part of a larger law firm.[73] Her clients were mostly international corporations doing business in the United States;[30] much of her time was spent tracking down and suing counterfeiters of Fendi goods.[13][73] In some cases, Sotomayor went on-site with the police to Harlem or Chinatown to have illegitimate merchandise seized, in the latter instance pursuing a fleeing culprit while riding on a motorcycle.[13][73] She said at the time that Pavia & Harcourt's efforts were run \"much like a drug operation\", and the successful rounding up of thousands of counterfeit accessories in 1986 was celebrated by \"Fendi Crush\", a destruction-by-garbage-truck event at Tavern on the Green.[76] At other times, she dealt with dry legal issues such as grain export contract disputes.[73] In a 1986 appearance on Good Morning America that profiled women ten years after college graduation, she said that the bulk of law work was drudgery, and that while she was content with her life, she had expected greater things of herself coming out of college.[71]  In 1988 she became a partner at the firm;[39][58] she was paid well but not extravagantly.[77] She left in 1992 when she became a judge.[9]\nIn addition to her law firm work, Sotomayor found visible public service roles.[78] She was not connected to the party bosses that typically picked people for such jobs in New York, and indeed she was registered as an independent.[78] Instead, District Attorney Morgenthau, an influential figure, served as her patron.[69][78] In 1987, Governor of New York Mario Cuomo appointed Sotomayor to the board of the State of New York Mortgage Agency, which she served on until 1992.[79] As part of one of the largest urban rebuilding efforts in American history,[79] the agency helped low-income people get home mortgages and to provide insurance coverage for housing and hospices for sufferers of AIDS.[8] Despite being the youngest member of a board composed of strong personalities, she involved herself in the details of the operation and was effective.[69][78] She was vocal in supporting the right to affordable housing, directing more funds to lower-income home owners, and in her skepticism about the effects of gentrification, although in the end she voted in favor of most of the projects.[78][79]\nSotomayor was appointed by Mayor Ed Koch in 1988 as one of the founding members of the New York City Campaign Finance Board, where she served for four years.[8][80] There she took a vigorous role[78] in the board's implementation of a voluntary scheme wherein local candidates received public matching funds in exchange for limits on contributions and spending and agreeing to greater financial disclosure.[81] Sotomayor showed no patience with candidates who failed to follow regulations and was more of a stickler for making campaigns follow those regulations than some of the other board members.[69][78] She joined in rulings that fined, audited, or reprimanded the mayoral campaigns of Koch, David Dinkins, and Rudy Giuliani.[78]\nBased upon another recommendation from Cabranes,[69] Sotomayor was a member of the board of directors of the Puerto Rican Legal Defense and Education Fund from 1980 to 1992.[82] There she was a top policy maker[8] who worked actively with the organization's lawyers on issues such as New York City hiring practices, police brutality, the death penalty, and voting rights.[82] The group achieved its most visible triumph when it successfully blocked a city primary election on the grounds that New York City Council boundaries diminished the power of minority voters.[82]\nDuring 1985 and 1986, Sotomayor served on the board of the Maternity Center Association, a Manhattan-based non-profit group which focused on improving the quality of maternity care.[83][84][85]\nSotomayor had wanted to become a judge since she was in elementary school, and in 1991 she was recommended for a spot by Democratic New York senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan.[8] Moynihan had an unusual bipartisan arrangement with his fellow New York senator, Republican Al D'Amato, whereby he would get to choose roughly one out of every four New York district court seats even though a Republican was in the White House.[35][86][87][88] Moynihan also wanted to fulfill a public promise he had made to get a Hispanic judge appointed for New York.[21] When Moynihan's staff recommended her to him, they said \"Have we got a judge for you!\"[8] Moynihan identified with her socio-economic and academic background and became convinced she would become the first Hispanic Supreme Court justice.[13][78] D'Amato became an enthusiastic backer of Sotomayor,[89] who was seen as politically centrist at the time.[8][21] Of the impending drop in salary from private practice, Sotomayor said: \"I've never wanted to get adjusted to my income because I knew I wanted to go back to public service. And in comparison to what my mother earns and how I was raised, it's not modest at all.\"[8]\nSotomayor was thus nominated on November 27, 1991, by President George H. W. Bush to a seat on the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York vacated by John M. Walker Jr.[6] Senate Judiciary Committee hearings, led by a friendly Democratic majority, went smoothly for her in June 1992, with her pro bono activities winning praise from Senator Ted Kennedy and her getting unanimous approval from the committee.[8][89][90] Then a Republican senator blocked her nomination and that of three others for a while in retaliation for an unrelated block Democrats had put on another nominee.[89][91] D'Amato objected strongly;[91] some weeks later, the block was dropped, and Sotomayor was confirmed by unanimous consent[64][89] of the full United States Senate on August 11, 1992, and received her commission the next day.[6]\nSotomayor became the youngest judge in the Southern District[92] and the first Hispanic federal judge in New York State.[93] She became the first Puerto Rican woman to serve as a judge in a U.S. federal court.[94]  She was one of seven women among the district's 58 judges.[8]  She moved from Carroll Gardens, Brooklyn, back to the Bronx in order to live within her district.[8]\nSotomayor generally kept a low public profile as a district court judge.[23] She showed a willingness to take anti-government positions in a number of cases, and during her first year in the seat, she received high ratings from liberal public-interest groups.[21]  Other sources and organizations regarded her as a centrist during this period.[8][21] In criminal cases, she gained a reputation for tough sentencing and was not viewed as a pro-defense judge.[95]  A Syracuse University study found that in such cases, Sotomayor generally handed out longer sentences than her colleagues, especially when white-collar crime was involved.[96]  Fellow district judge Miriam Goldman Cedarbaum was an influence on Sotomayor in adopting a narrow, \"just the facts\" approach to judicial decision-making.[57]\nAs a trial judge, she garnered a reputation for being well-prepared in advance of a case and moving cases along a tight schedule.[21]  Lawyers before her court viewed her as plain-spoken, intelligent, demanding, and sometimes somewhat unforgiving; one said, \"She does not have much patience for people trying to snow her. You can't do it.\"[21]\nOn March 30, 1995, in Silverman v. Major League Baseball Player Relations Committee, Inc.,[97] Sotomayor issued a preliminary injunction against Major League Baseball, preventing it from unilaterally implementing a new collective bargaining agreement and using replacement players. Her ruling ended the 1994 baseball strike after 232 days, the day before the new season was scheduled to begin. The Second Circuit upheld Sotomayor's decision and denied the owners' request to stay the ruling.[23][98][99]  The decision raised her profile,[13] won her the plaudits of baseball fans,[23] and had a lasting effect on the game.[100] In the preparatory phase of the case, Sotomayor informed the lawyers of both sides that, \"I hope none of you assumed ... that my lack of knowledge of any of the intimate details of your dispute meant I was not a baseball fan. You can't grow up in the South Bronx without knowing about baseball.\"[101]\nIn Dow Jones v. Department of Justice (1995),[102] Sotomayor sided with the Wall Street Journal in its efforts to obtain and publish a photocopy of the last note left by former Deputy White House Counsel Vince Foster. Sotomayor ruled that the public had \"a substantial interest\"[103] in viewing the note and enjoined the U.S. Justice Department from blocking its release.\nIn New York Times Co. v. Tasini (1997), freelance journalists sued the New York Times Company for copyright infringement for The New York Times' inclusion in an electronic archival database (LexisNexis) of the work of freelancers it had published. Sotomayor ruled that the publisher had the right to license the freelancers' work. This decision was reversed on appeal, and the Supreme Court upheld the reversal; two dissenters (John Paul Stevens and Stephen Breyer) took Sotomayor's position.[104]\nIn Castle Rock Entertainment, Inc. v. Carol Publishing Group (also in 1997), Sotomayor ruled that a book of trivia from the television program Seinfeld infringed on the copyright of the show's producer and did not constitute legal fair use. The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit upheld Sotomayor's ruling.\nOn June 25, 1997, Sotomayor was nominated by President Bill Clinton to a seat on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, which was vacated by J. Daniel Mahoney.[6] Her nomination was initially expected to have smooth sailing,[23][105] with the American Bar Association Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary giving her a \"well qualified\" professional assessment.[106] However, as The New York Times described, \"[it became] embroiled in the sometimes tortured judicial politics of the Senate.\"[107] Some in the Republican majority believed Clinton was eager to name the first Hispanic Supreme Court justice and that an easy confirmation to the appeals court would put Sotomayor in a better position for a possible Supreme Court nomination (despite there being no vacancy at the time nor any indication the Clinton administration was considering nominating her or any Hispanic). Therefore, the Republican majority decided to slow her confirmation.[18][105][107] Radio commentator Rush Limbaugh weighed in that Sotomayor was an ultraliberal who was on a \"rocket ship\" to the highest court.[105]\nDuring her September 1997 hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Sotomayor parried strong questioning from some Republican members about mandatory sentencing, gay rights, and her level of respect for Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas.[90] After a long wait, she was approved by the committee in March 1998, with only two dissensions.[90][105] However, in June 1998, the influential Wall Street Journal editorial page opined that the Clinton administration intended to \"get her on to the Second Circuit, then elevate her to the Supreme Court as soon as an opening occurs\"; the editorial criticized two of her district court rulings and urged further delay of her confirmation.[108]  The Republican block continued.[23][105]\nRanking Democratic committee member Patrick Leahy objected to Republican use of a secret hold to slow down the Sotomayor nomination, and Leahy attributed that anonymous tactic to GOP reticence about publicly opposing a female Hispanic nominee.[105][109] The prior month, Leahy had triggered a procedural delay in the confirmation of fellow Second Circuit nominee Chester J. Straub—who, although advanced by Clinton and supported by Senator Moynihan, was considered much more acceptable by Republicans—in an unsuccessful effort to force earlier consideration of the Sotomayor confirmation.[110]\nDuring 1998, several Hispanic organizations organized a petition drive in New York State, generating hundreds of signatures from New Yorkers to try to convince New York Republican senator Al D'Amato to push the Senate leadership to bring Sotomayor's nomination to a vote.[111] D'Amato, a backer of Sotomayor to begin with and additionally concerned about being up for re-election that year,[111] helped move Republican leadership.[13] Her nomination had been pending for over a year when Majority Leader Trent Lott scheduled the vote.[107] With complete Democratic support, and support from 25 Republican senators including Judiciary chair Orrin Hatch,[107] Sotomayor was confirmed on October 2, 1998, by a 67–29 vote.[112] She received her commission on October 7.[6]  The confirmation experience left Sotomayor somewhat angry; she said shortly afterwards that during the hearings, Republicans had assumed her political beliefs based on her being a Latina: \"That series of questions, I think, were symbolic of a set of expectations that some people had [that] I must be liberal. It is stereotyping, and stereotyping is perhaps the most insidious of all problems in our society today.\"[23]\nOver her ten years on the Second Circuit, Sotomayor heard appeals in more than 3,000 cases and wrote about 380 opinions when she was in the majority.[13] The Supreme Court reviewed five of those, reversing three and affirming two[13]—not high numbers for an appellate judge of that many years[18] and a typical percentage of reversals.[113]\nSotomayor's circuit court rulings led to her being considered a political centrist by the ABA Journal[75][114] and other sources and organizations.[75][92][114][115][116][117] Several lawyers, legal experts, and news organizations identified her as someone with liberal inclinations.[118][119][120] In any case, the Second Circuit's caseload typically skewed more toward business and securities law rather than hot-button social or constitutional issues.[18] Sotomayor tended to write narrow, practiced rulings that relied on close application of the law to the facts of a case rather than import general philosophical viewpoints.[18][121] A Congressional Research Service analysis found that Sotomayor's rulings defied easy ideological categorization, but did show an adherence to precedent and an avoidance of overstepping the circuit court's judicial role.[122] Unusually, Sotomayor read through all the supporting documents of cases under review; her lengthy rulings explored every aspect of a case and tended to feature leaden, ungainly prose.[123] Some legal experts have said that Sotomayor's attention to detail and re-examination of the facts of a case came close to overstepping the traditional role of appellate judges.[124]\nAcross some 150 cases involving business and civil law, Sotomayor's rulings were generally unpredictable and not consistently pro-business or anti-business.[125]  Sotomayor's influence in the federal judiciary, as measured by the number of citations of her rulings by other judges and in law review articles, increased significantly during the length of her appellate judgeship and was greater than that of some other prominent federal appeals court judges.[126] Two academic studies showed that the percentage of Sotomayor's decisions that overrode policy decisions by elected branches was the same as or lower than that of other circuit judges.[127]\nSotomayor was a member of the Second Circuit Task Force on Gender, Racial and Ethnic Fairness in the Courts.[104] In October 2001, she presented the annual Judge Mario G. Olmos Memorial Lecture at UC Berkeley School of Law;[16] titled \"A Latina Judge's Voice\"; it was published in the Berkeley La Raza Law Journal the following spring.[128][129]  In the speech, she discussed the characteristics of her Latina upbringing and culture and the history of minorities and women ascending to the federal bench.[130]  She said the low number of minority women on the federal bench at that time was \"shocking\".[42] She then discussed at length how her own experiences as a Latina might affect her decisions as a judge.[130]  In any case, her background in activism did not necessarily influence her rulings: in a study of 50 racial discrimination cases brought before her panel, 45 were rejected, with Sotomayor never filing a dissent.[42] An expanded study showed that Sotomayor decided 97 cases involving a claim of discrimination and rejected those claims nearly 90 percent of the time.[131]  Another examination of Second Circuit split decisions on cases that dealt with race and discrimination showed no clear ideological pattern in Sotomayor's opinions.[132]\nIn the Court of Appeals seat, Sotomayor gained a reputation for vigorous and blunt behavior toward lawyers appealing before her, sometimes to the point of brusque and curt treatment or testy interruptions.[13][133]  She was known for extensive preparation for oral arguments and for running a \"hot bench\", where judges ask lawyers plenty of questions.[133][134] Unprepared lawyers suffered the consequences, but the vigorous questioning was an aid to lawyers seeking to tailor their arguments to the judge's concerns.[134] The 2009 Almanac of the Federal Judiciary, which collected anonymous evaluations of judges by lawyers who appear before them, contained a wide range of reactions to Sotomayor.[13] Comments also diverged among lawyers willing to be named. Attorney Sheema Chaudhry said, \"She's brilliant and she's qualified, but I just feel that she can be very, how do you say, temperamental.\"[133] Defense lawyer Gerald B. Lefcourt said, \"She used her questioning to make a point, as opposed to really looking for an answer to a question she did not understand.\"[133] In contrast, Second Circuit Judge Richard C. Wesley said that his interactions with Sotomayor had been \"totally antithetical to this perception that has gotten some traction that she is somehow confrontational.\"[133] Second Circuit Judge and former teacher Guido Calabresi said his tracking showed that Sotomayor's questioning patterns were no different from those of other members of the court and added, \"Some lawyers just don't like to be questioned by a woman. [The criticism] was sexist, plain and simple.\"[133]\nSotomayor's law clerks regarded her as a valuable and strong mentor, and she said that she viewed them like family.[52]\nIn 2005, Senate Democrats suggested Sotomayor, among others, to President George W. Bush as an acceptable nominee to fill the seat of retiring Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor.[135]\nIn the 2002 decision Center for Reproductive Law and Policy v. Bush,[136] Sotomayor upheld the Bush administration's implementation of the Mexico City Policy, which states that \"the United States will no longer contribute to separate nongovernmental organizations which perform or actively promote abortion as a method of family planning in other nations.\"[137] Sotomayor held that the policy did not constitute a violation of equal protection, as \"the government is free to favor the anti-abortion position over the pro-choice position, and can do so with public funds.\"[136]\nIn Pappas v. Giuliani (2002),[138] Sotomayor dissented from her colleagues' ruling that the New York Police Department could terminate from his desk job an employee who sent racist materials through the mail. Sotomayor argued that the First Amendment protected speech by the employee \"away from the office, on [his] own time\", even if that speech was \"offensive, hateful, and insulting\", and that therefore the employee's First Amendment claim should have gone to trial rather than being dismissed on summary judgment.[139]\nIn 2005, Sotomayor wrote the opinion for United States v. Quattrone.[140] Frank Quattrone had been on trial on charges of obstructing investigations related to technology IPOs. Some members of the media had wanted to publish the names of the jurors deciding Quattrone's case, and a district court had issued an order to forbid the publication of the juror's names. In United States v. Quattrone, Sotomayor wrote the opinion for the Second Circuit panel striking down this order on First Amendment grounds, stating that the media should be free to publish the names of the jurors. The first trial ended in a deadlocked jury and a mistrial, and the district court ordered the media not to publish the names of jurors, even though those names had been disclosed in open court. Sotomayor held that although it was important to protect the fairness of the retrial, the district court's order was an unconstitutional prior restraint on free speech and violated the right of the press \"to report freely on events that transpire in an open courtroom\".[140]\nIn 2008, Sotomayor was on a three-judge panel in Doninger v. Niehoff[141] that unanimously affirmed, in an opinion written by Second Circuit Judge Debra Livingston, the district court's judgment that Lewis S. Mills High School did not violate the First Amendment rights of a student when it barred her from running for student government after she called the superintendent and other school officials \"douchebags\" in a blog post written while off-campus that encouraged students to call an administrator and \"piss her off more\".[141] Judge Livingston held that the district judge did not abuse her discretion in holding that the student's speech \"foreseeably create[d] a risk of substantial disruption within the school environment\",[142] which is the precedent in the Second Circuit for when schools may regulate off-campus speech.[141]  Although Sotomayor did not write this opinion, she has been criticized by some who disagree with it.[143]\nSotomayor was part of the three-judge Second Circuit panel that affirmed the district court's ruling in Maloney v. Cuomo (2009).[144]  Maloney was arrested for possession of nunchucks, which are illegal in New York; Maloney argued that this law violated his Second Amendment right to bear arms. The Second Circuit's per curiam opinion noted that the Supreme Court has not, so far, ever held that the Second Amendment is binding against state governments. On the contrary, in Presser v. Illinois, a Supreme Court case from 1886, the Supreme Court held that the Second Amendment \"is a limitation only upon the power of Congress and the national government, and not upon that of the state\".[144] With respect to the Presser v. Illinois precedent, the panel stated that only the Supreme Court has \"the prerogative of overruling its own decisions,\"[145] and the recent Supreme Court case of District of Columbia v. Heller (which struck down the district's gun ban as unconstitutional) did \"not invalidate this longstanding principle\".[144] The panel upheld the lower court's decision dismissing Maloney's challenge to New York's law against possession of nunchucks.[146]  On June 2, 2009, a Seventh Circuit panel, including the prominent and heavily cited judges Richard Posner and Frank Easterbrook, unanimously agreed with Maloney v. Cuomo, citing the case in their decision turning back a challenge to Chicago's gun laws and noting the Supreme Court precedents remain in force until altered by the Supreme Court itself.[145]\nIn N.G. & S.G. ex rel. S.C. v. Connecticut (2004),[147] Sotomayor dissented from her colleagues' decision to uphold a series of strip searches of \"troubled adolescent girls\" in juvenile detention centers. While Sotomayor agreed that some of the strip searches at issue in the case were lawful, she would have held that due to \"the severely intrusive nature of strip searches\",[147] they should not be allowed \"in the absence of individualized suspicion, of adolescents who have never been charged with a crime\".[147] She argued that an \"individualized suspicion\" rule was more consistent with Second Circuit precedent than the majority's rule.[147]\nIn Leventhal v. Knapek (2001),[148] Sotomayor rejected a Fourth Amendment challenge by a U.S. Department of Transportation employee whose employer searched his office computer. She held that, \"Even though [the employee] had some expectation of privacy in the contents of his office computer, the investigatory searches by the DOT did not violate his Fourth Amendment rights\"[148] because here \"there were reasonable grounds to believe\" that the search would reveal evidence of \"work-related misconduct\".[148]\nIn 2004, Sotomayor was part of the judge panel that ruled in Swedenburg v. Kelly that New York's law prohibiting out-of-state wineries from shipping directly to consumers in New York was constitutional even though in-state wineries were allowed to. The case, which invoked the 21st Amendment, was appealed and attached to another case. The case reached the Supreme Court later on as Swedenburg v. Kelly and was overruled in a 5–4 decision that found the law was discriminatory and unconstitutional.[149]\nSotomayor was involved in the high-profile case Ricci v. DeStefano  that initially upheld the right of the City of New Haven to throw out its test for firefighters and start over with a new test, because the City believed the test had a \"disparate impact\"[150] on minority firefighters. (No black firefighters qualified for promotion under the test, whereas some had qualified under tests used in previous years.) The City was concerned that minority firefighters might sue under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The City chose not to certify the test results and a lower court had previously upheld the City's right to do this. Several white firefighters and one Hispanic firefighter who had passed the test, including the lead plaintiff who has dyslexia and had put extra effort into studying, sued the City of New Haven, claiming that their rights were violated. A Second Circuit panel that included Sotomayor first issued a brief, unsigned summary order (not written by Sotomayor) affirming the lower court's ruling.[151] Sotomayor's former mentor José A. Cabranes, by now a fellow judge on the court, objected to this handling and requested that the court hear it en banc.[152] Sotomayor voted with a 7–6 majority not to rehear it and a slightly expanded ruling was issued, but a strong dissent by Cabranes led to the case reaching the Supreme Court in 2009.[152]  There it was overruled in a 5–4 decision that found the white firefighters had been victims of racial discrimination when they were denied promotion.[153]\nIn Clarett v. National Football League (2004),[154] Sotomayor upheld the National Football League's eligibility rules requiring players to wait three full seasons after high school graduation before entering the NFL draft. Maurice Clarett challenged these rules, which were part of the collective bargaining agreement between the NFL and its players, on antitrust grounds. Sotomayor held that Clarett's claim would upset the established \"federal labor law favoring and governing the collective bargaining process\".[155]\nIn Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc. v. Dabit (2005),[156] Sotomayor wrote a unanimous opinion that the Securities Litigation Uniform Standards Act of 1998 did not preempt class action claims in state courts by stockbrokers alleging misleading inducement to buy or sell stocks.[113] The Supreme Court handed down an 8–0 decision stating that the Act did preempt such claims, thereby overruling Sotomayor's decision.[113]\nIn Specht v. Netscape Communications Corp. (2001),[157] she ruled that the license agreement of Netscape's Smart Download software did not constitute a binding contract because the system didn't give \"sufficient notice\" to the user.[158]\nIn Correctional Services Corp. v. Malesko (2000),[159] Sotomayor, writing for the court, supported the right of an individual to sue a private corporation working on behalf of the federal government for alleged violations of that individual's constitutional rights. Reversing a lower court decision, Sotomayor found that an existing Supreme Court doctrine, known as \"Bivens\"—which allows suits against individuals working for the federal government for constitutional rights violations—could be applied to the case of a former prisoner seeking to sue the private company operating the federal halfway house facility in which he resided. The Supreme Court reversed Sotomayor's ruling in a 5–4 decision, saying that the Bivens doctrine could not be expanded to cover private entities working on behalf of the federal government. Justices Stevens, Souter, Ginsburg, and Breyer dissented, siding with Sotomayor's original ruling.\nIn Gant v. Wallingford Board of Education (1999),[160] the parents of a black student alleged that he had been harassed due to his race and had been discriminated against when he was transferred from a first grade class to a kindergarten class without parental consent, while similarly situated white students were treated differently. Sotomayor agreed with the dismissal of the harassment claims due to lack of evidence, but would have allowed the discrimination claim to go forward. She wrote in dissent that the grade transfer was \"contrary to the school's established policies\" as well as its treatment of white students, which \"supports the inference that race discrimination played a role\".\nIn Krimstock v. Kelly (2002),[161] Sotomayor wrote an opinion halting New York City's practice of seizing the motor vehicles of drivers accused of driving while intoxicated and some other crimes and holding those vehicles for \"months or even years\" during criminal proceedings. Noting the importance of cars to many individuals' livelihoods or daily activities, she held that it violated individuals' due process rights to hold the vehicles without permitting the owners to challenge the City's continued possession of their property.\nIn Brody v. Village of Port Chester (2003 and 2005),[162] a takings case, Sotomayor first ruled in 2003 for a unanimous panel that a property owner in Port Chester, New York was permitted to challenge the state's Eminent Domain Procedure Law. A district court subsequently rejected the plaintiff's claims and upon appeal the case found itself again with the Second Circuit. In 2005, Sotomayor ruled with a panel majority that the property owner's due process rights had been violated by lack of adequate notice to him of his right to challenge a village order that his land should be used for a redevelopment project. However, the panel supported the village's taking of the property for public use.[163]\nIn Didden v. Village of Port Chester (2006),[164] an unrelated case brought about by the same town's actions, Sotomayor joined a unanimous panel's summary order to uphold a trial court's dismissal – due to a statute of limitations lapse – of a property owner's objection to his land being condemned for a redevelopment project. The ruling further said that even without the lapse, the owner's petition would be denied due to application of the Supreme Court's recent Kelo v. City of New London ruling. The Second Circuit's reasoning drew criticism from libertarian commentators.[165][166]\nFollowing Barack Obama's 2008 presidential election victory, speculation arose that Sotomayor could be a leading candidate for a Supreme Court seat.[75][114][115][167] New York Senators Charles Schumer and Kirsten Gillibrand wrote a joint letter to Obama urging him to appoint Sotomayor, or alternatively Interior Secretary Ken Salazar, to the Supreme Court if a vacancy should arise during his term.[168] The White House first contacted Sotomayor on April 27, 2009, about the possibility of her nomination.[169] On April 30, 2009, Justice David Souter's retirement plans leaked to the media, and Sotomayor received early attention as a possible nominee for Souter's seat to be vacated in June 2009.[170] On May 25, Obama informed Sotomayor of his choice; she later said, \"I had my [hand] over my chest, trying to calm my beating heart, literally.\"[171] On May 26, 2009, Obama nominated her.[172] She became only the second jurist to be nominated to three different judicial positions by three different presidents.[173] The selection appeared to closely match Obama's presidential campaign promise that he would nominate judges who had \"the heart, the empathy, to recognize what it's like to be a teenage mom. The empathy to understand what it's like to be poor, or African-American, or gay, or disabled, or old.\"[174]\nSotomayor's nomination won praise from Democrats and liberals, and Democrats appeared to have sufficient votes to confirm her.[175] The strongest criticism of her nomination came from conservatives and some Republican senators regarding a line she had used in similar forms in a number of her speeches, particularly in a 2001 Berkeley Law lecture:[130][175] \"I would hope that a wise Latina woman with the richness of her experiences would more often than not reach a better conclusion than a white male who hasn't lived that life.\"[16] Sotomayor had made similar remarks in other speeches between 1994 and 2003, including one she submitted as part of her confirmation questionnaire for the Court of Appeals in 1998, but they had attracted little attention at the time.[176][177] The remark now became widely known.[178] The rhetoric quickly became inflamed, with radio commentator Rush Limbaugh and former Republican Speaker of the House of Representatives Newt Gingrich calling Sotomayor a \"racist\" (although the latter later backtracked from that claim),[179] while John Cornyn and other Republican senators denounced such attacks but said that Sotomayor's approach was troubling.[180][181] Backers of Sotomayor offered a variety of explanations in defense of the remark,[182] and White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs stated that Sotomayor's word choice in 2001 had been \"poor\".[180] Sotomayor subsequently clarified her remark through Senate Judiciary Committee chair Patrick Leahy, saying that while life experience shapes who one is, \"ultimately and completely\" a judge follows the law regardless of personal background.[183] Of her cases, the Second Circuit rulings in Ricci v. DeStefano received the most attention during the early nomination discussion,[184] motivated by the Republican desire to focus on the reverse racial discrimination aspect of the case.[178] In the midst of her confirmation process the Supreme Court overturned that ruling on June 29.[153] A third line of Republican attack against Sotomayor was based on her ruling in Maloney v. Cuomo and was motivated by gun ownership advocates concerned about her interpretation of Second Amendment rights.[178]  Some of the fervor with which conservatives and Republicans viewed the Sotomayor nomination was due to their grievances over the history of federal judicial nomination battles going back to the 1987 Robert Bork Supreme Court nomination.[185]\nA Gallup poll released a week after the nomination showed 54 percent of Americans in favor of Sotomayor's confirmation compared with 28 percent in opposition.[186] A June 12 Fox News poll showed 58 percent of the public disagreeing with her \"wise Latina\" remark but 67 percent saying the remark should not disqualify her from serving on the Supreme Court.[187] The American Bar Association gave her a unanimous \"well qualified\" assessment, its highest mark for professional qualification.[106]  Following the Ricci overruling, Rasmussen Reports and CNN/Opinion Research polls showed that the public was now sharply divided, largely along partisan and ideological lines, as to whether Sotomayor should be confirmed.[188][189]\nSotomayor's confirmation hearings before the Senate Judiciary Committee began on July 13, 2009, during which she backed away from her \"wise Latina\" remark, declaring it \"a rhetorical flourish that fell flat\" and stating that \"I do not believe that any ethnic, racial or gender group has an advantage in sound judgment.\"[190][191]  When Republican senators confronted her regarding other remarks from her past speeches, she pointed to her judicial record and said she had never let her own life experiences or opinions influence her decisions.[192] Republican senators said that while her rulings to this point might be largely traditional, they feared her Supreme Court rulings – where there is more latitude with respect to precedent and interpretation – might be more reflective of her speeches.[193][194] Sotomayor defended her position in Ricci as following applicable precedent.[190]  When asked whom she admired, she pointed to Justice Benjamin N. Cardozo.[195] In general, Sotomayor followed the hearings formula of recent past nominees by avoiding stating personal positions, declining to take positions on controversial issues likely to come before the Court, agreeing with senators from both parties, and repeatedly affirming that as a justice she would just apply the law.[196]\nOn July 28, 2009, the Senate Judiciary Committee voted 13–6 in favor of Sotomayor's nomination, sending it to the full Senate for a final confirmation vote. Every Democrat voted in her favor, as did one Republican, Lindsey Graham.[197][198] On August 6, 2009, Sotomayor was confirmed by the full Senate by a vote of 68–31. All Democrats present, along with the Senate's two Independents plus nine Republicans, voted for her.[199][200]\nPresident Obama commissioned Sotomayor on the day of her confirmation,[201] and her swearing-in ceremony took place on August 8, 2009, at the Supreme Court Building. Chief Justice John Roberts administered the prescribed constitutional and judicial oaths of office, at which time she became the 111th justice (99th associate justice) of the Supreme Court.[202] Sotomayor is the first Hispanic to serve on the Supreme Court,[199][200][203][204][b] and is one of five women who have served on the Court, along with Sandra Day O'Connor (from 1981 to 2006), Ruth Bader Ginsburg (from 1993 to 2020), Elena Kagan (since 2010),[207] and Amy Coney Barrett (since 2020).[208] Sotomayor's appointment gave the Court a record six Roman Catholic justices serving at the same time.[3][c]\nSotomayor cast her first vote as an associate Supreme Court justice on August 17, 2009, in a stay of execution case.[209] She was given a warm welcome onto the Court[210] and was formally invested in a September 8 ceremony.[211] Sotomayor's inaugural case in which she heard arguments was on September 9 during a special session, Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission. It involved the controversial aspect of the First Amendment and the rights of corporations in campaign finance;[212] Sotomayor dissented.[213][214] In her vigorous examination of Floyd Abrams, representing the First Amendment issues in the case, Sotomayor challenged him, questioning 19th century rulings of the Court and saying, \"What you are suggesting is that the courts, who created corporations as persons, gave birth to corporations as persons, and there could be an argument made that that was the Court's error to start with ... [imbuing] a creature of State law with human characteristics.\"[212][215]\nSotomayor's first major written opinion was a dissent in the Berghuis v. Thompkins case dealing with Miranda rights.[213][216] As her first year neared completion, Sotomayor said she felt swamped by the intensity and heavy workload of the job.[216] During the oral arguments for National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius, Sotomayor showed her increasing familiarity with the Court and its protocols by directing the opening questions of the arguments to Donald Verrilli, the Solicitor General who was representing the government's position.[217]\nIn succeeding Justice Souter, Sotomayor had done little to change the philosophical and ideological balance of the Court.[213][214][216]  While many cases are decided unanimously or with different voting coalitions, Sotomayor has continued to be a reliable member of the liberal bloc of the court when the justices divide along the commonly perceived ideological lines.[218] Specifically, her voting pattern and judicial philosophy has been in close agreement with that of Justices Breyer, Ginsburg and Kagan.[219] During her first couple of years there, Sotomayor voted with Ginsburg and Breyer 90 percent of the time, one of the highest agreement rates on the Court.[213][220] In a 2015 article titled \"Ranking the Most Liberal Modern Supreme Court Justices\", Alex Greer identified Sotomayor as representing a more liberal voting pattern than both Elena Kagan and Ruth Bader Ginsburg.[221] Greer placed Sotomayor as having the most liberal voting history of all the current sitting Justices, and slightly less liberal than her predecessors Thurgood Marshall and John Marshall Harlan II on the Court.[221]\nChief Justice Roberts, together with Justices Kennedy, Thomas, and Alito (and former Justice Scalia) have comprised the identifiable conservative wing of the Court.[222] Although, five of the justices on the Supreme Court self-identify as having Roman Catholic affiliation, Sotomayor's voting history identifies her singly among them with the liberal bloc of the Court. However, there is a wide divergence among Catholics in general in their approaches to the law.[3]  Due to her upbringing and her past jobs and positions, Sotomayor has brought one of the more diverse set of life experiences to the court.[223]\nThere have been some deviations from the ideological pattern. In a 2013 book on the Roberts Court, author Marcia Coyle assessed Sotomayor's position on the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment as a strong guarantee of the right of a defendant to confront his or her accusers.[219]  Sotomayor's judicial philosophy on the issue is seen as being in parity with Elena Kagan and, unexpectedly for Sotomayor, also in at least partial agreement with the originalist reading of Antonin Scalia when applied to the clause.\nOn January 20 and 21, 2013, Sotomayor administered the oath to Vice President Joe Biden for the inauguration of his second term. Sotomayor became the first Hispanic and fourth woman to administer the oath to a president or vice president.[224] On January 20, 2021, Sotomayor administered the oath of office to Kamala Harris for her inauguration as vice president, the first woman to ever hold the office.[225]\nBy the end of her fifth year on the court, Sotomayor had become especially visible in oral arguments and in passionate dissents from various majority rulings, especially those involving issues of race, gender and ethnic identity.[226] Sotomayor has shown her individuality on the Court in a number of decisions. In her reading of the constitutionality of the Obama health care law favoring the poor and disabled, she sided with Ginsburg against fellow liberals Breyer and Kagan.[227] In dealing with the Chief Justice, Sotomayor had no difficulty in responding to his statement that \"the way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discrimination on the basis of race,\" by stating, \"I don't borrow Chief Justice Roberts's description of what color-blindness is... Our society is too complex to use that kind of analysis.\"[228] In the manufacturer liability case of Williamson v. Mazda, which the court decided unanimously, she wrote a separate concurring opinion.[229] Sotomayor's rapport with her clerks is seen as more formalistic than some of the other justices as she requires detailed and rigorous evaluations of cases she is considering with a table of contents attached.[230] When compared to Kagan directly, one of their colleagues stated, \"Neither of them is a shrinking violet\". Coyle, in her 2013 book on the Roberts Court stated that: \"Both women are more vocal during arguments than the justices whom they succeeded, and they have energized the moderate-liberal side of the bench.\"[231]\nDuring her tenure on the court, Sotomayor has also become recognizable as being among the court's strongest voices in supporting the rights of the accused.[232]  She has been identified by Laurence Tribe as the foremost voice on the court calling for reforming criminal justice adjudication – in particular as it relates misconduct by police and prosecutors, abuses in prisons, concerns about how the death penalty is used, and the potential for loss of privacy – and Tribe has compared her will to reform in general to that of past Chief Justice Earl Warren.[233]\nIn January 2019, Bonnie Kristian of The Week wrote that an \"unexpected civil libertarian alliance\" was developing between Sotomayor and Neil Gorsuch \"in defense of robust due process rights and skepticism of law enforcement overreach.\"[234]\nIn 2011, Sotomayor wrote the majority opinion in J.D.B. v. North Carolina, in which the Supreme Court held that age is relevant when determining when a person is in police custody for Miranda purposes. J.D.B. was a 13-year-old student enrolled in special education classes whom police had suspected of committing two robberies. A police investigator visited J.D.B. at school, where he was interrogated by the investigator, a uniformed police officer, and school officials. J.D.B. subsequently confessed to his crimes and was convicted. J.D.B. was not given a Miranda warning during the interrogation, nor an opportunity to contact his legal guardian. In determining that a child's age properly informs the Miranda custody analysis, Sotomayor wrote that \"to hold... that a child's age is never relevant to whether a suspect has been taken into custody— and thus to ignore the very real differences between children and adults— would be to deny children the full scope of the procedural safeguards that Miranda guarantees to adults\".[235] Sotomayor's opinion cited the Court's earlier decisions in Stansbury v. California (holding that held that a child's age \"would have affected how a reasonable person\" would \"perceive his or her freedom to leave\") and Yarborough v. Alvarado (holding that a child's age \"generates commonsense conclusions about behavior and perception\"). Sotomayor also pointed out that the law recognizes that child's judgment is not the same as an adult's, in the form of legal disqualifications on children as a class (e.g. limitations on a child's ability to marry without parental consent). Associate Justice Samuel Alito, jointed by three other justices, wrote a dissenting opinion.\nIn United States v. Alvarez (2012), the Court struck down the Stolen Valor Act (a federal law that criminalized false statements about having received a military medal) on First Amendment grounds. While a 6–3 majority of the Court agreed that the law was an unconstitutional violation of the Free Speech Clause, it could not agree on a single rationale. Sotomayor was among four justices, along with Justices Roberts, Ginsburg and Kennedy, who concluded that a statement's falsity is not enough, by itself, to exclude speech from First Amendment protection. Justices Breyer and Kagan concluded that while false statements were entitled to some protection, the act was invalid because it could have achieved its objectives in less restrictive ways. Justices Scalia, Thomas and Alito dissented.[236]\nIn National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius (2012), Sotomayor was part of a 5–4 majority that upheld most of the provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (while being part of a dissent against the reliance upon the Constitution's Taxing and Spending Clause rather than Commerce Clause in arriving at the support). Legal writer Jeffrey Toobin wrote, \"Sotomayor's concerns tended toward the earthbound and practical. Sometimes, during oral arguments, she would go on tangents involving detailed questions about the facts of cases that would leave her colleagues stupefied, sinking into their chairs. This time, though, she had a simple line of inquiry. States require individuals to buy automobile insurance (implicitly suggesting the unavoidable comparison to health insurance and the fairness of the applying the same principle to health insurance as well).\"[237] Sotomayor concluded with the incisive rhetorical flourish in the Court directed at the attorneys: \"Do you think that if some states decided not to impose an insurance requirement that the federal government would be without power to legislate and require every individual to buy car insurance?\" For Toobin, this distinction drawn by Sotomayor was the heart of the argument for the case in which she was part of the prevailing majority opinion.[237]\nIn 2014, Sotomayor dissented from a 6–3 ruling that granted Wheaton College of Illinois, a religiously affiliated university, an exemption from complying with Affordable Care Act (ACA)'s mandate on contraception.[238] The ruling, which came the immediate wake of the Court's 5–4 decision in Burwell v. Hobby Lobby, in which the conservative bloc had prevailed, was opposed by the court's three female members: Sotomayor, Ginsburg and Kagan.  Writing in dissent, Sotomayor wrote that the case was at odds with the majority's previous statements in Hobby Lobby and said,  \"Those who are bound by our decisions usually believe they can take us at our word ... Not today.\" Sotomayor stated further her opinion that the decision compromised \"hundreds of Wheaton's employees and students of their legal entitlement to contraceptive coverage.\"[238]\nSotomayor was part of a 5–3 majority in Arizona v. United States (2012), that struck down several aspects of the Arizona SB 1070 anti-illegal immigration law.[239][240]\nOn the Court, Sotomayor has taken positions in favor of an expansive view of the Fourth Amendment protections relating to privacy rights and search and seizure.[241][242] In United States v. Jones (2012), all nine justices agreed that a warrant was likely to be required before police could place a GPS tracking device on a suspect's car. Most justices sided with a narrow opinion written by Justice Samuel Alito, but Sotomayor (in a lone concurrence) advocated a more expansive view of privacy rights in a digital age, calling for a re-assessment of the longstanding third-party doctrine: \"It may be necessary to reconsider the premise that an individual has no reasonable expectation of privacy in information voluntarily disclosed to third parties.\"[243] The following year, federal judge Richard J. Leon cited this concurrence in his ruling that the National Security Agency's bulk collection of Americans' telephony records likely violated the Fourth Amendment.[243]  Law professors Adam Winkler and Laurence Tribe were among those who said that Sotomayor's Jones concurrence had been influential in calling out the need for a new basis in understanding privacy requirements in a world, as she wrote, \"in which people reveal a great deal of information about themselves to third parties in the course of carrying out mundane tasks.\"[243] In Missouri v. McNeely (2013), Sotomayor wrote the majority opinion holding that a warrant is required before police take a nonconsensual blood test of a motorist suspected of drunk driving.[242] In Navarette v. California (2014), Sotomayor joined Justice Scalia's dissent from an opinion finding no Fourth Amendment violation from a traffic stop and drug seizure based solely on an anonymous tip submitted to 9-1-1.[242] Sotomayor was the lone dissenter in Mullenix v. Luna (2015), a case in which the Court held, per curiam, that an officer who fired six shots at a fleeing fugitive in a high-speed car chase was entitled to qualified immunity; Sotomayor argued that \"By sanctioning a 'shoot first, think later' approach to policing, the Court renders the protections of the Fourth Amendment hollow.\"[242][244] In Utah v. Strieff, a case involving the exclusionary rule, Sotomayor wrote a dissent from the Court's ruling that evidence obtained as a result of an illegal police stop could be admitted if the stopped person was later found to have an outstanding traffic warrant,[242][245]  writing that it was a \"remarkable proposition\" that the existence of a warrant could justify a stop illegally based on police officers' \"whim or hunch.\"[245] Echoing her earlier dissent in Heien v. North Carolina (2014), and citing the works of figures such as W. E. B. Du Bois, James Baldwin, and Ta-Nehisi Coates, Sotomayor wrote that Strieff and other Supreme Court Fourth Amendment jurisprudence sent the message \"that you are not the citizen of a democracy but the subject of a carceral state, just waiting to be catalogued.\"[246][247]\nSotomayor was the sole dissenter in BP P.L.C. v. Mayor and City Council of Baltimore (2021), a case that made it harder for cities and states to win lawsuits against polluters.\nIn Whole Woman's Health v. Jackson (2021), a case regarding an abortion law in Texas that allows private citizens to sue abortion providers, Sotomayor wrote a sharp dissenting opinion, joined by justices Breyer and Kagan. By a 5-4 vote, the Supreme Court allowed the Texas law to stay in effect. Sotomayor concluded that \"Today’s fractured Court evinces no such courage. While the Court properly holds that this suit may proceed against the licensing officials, it errs gravely in foreclosing relief against state-court officials and the state attorney general. By so doing, the Court leaves all manner of constitutional rights more vulnerable than ever before, to the great detriment of our Constitution and our Republic.\" [248]\nSotomayor was an adjunct professor at New York University School of Law from 1998 to 2007.[249] There she taught trial and appellate advocacy as well as a federal appellate court seminar.[249] Beginning in 1999, she was also a lecturer in law at Columbia Law School in a paying, adjunct faculty position.[84][250] While there she created and co-taught a class called the Federal Appellate Externship each semester from 2000 until her departure; it combined classroom, moot court, and Second Circuit chambers work.[250] She became a member of the Board of Trustees of Princeton University in 2006, concluding her term in 2011.[48][251] In 2008, Sotomayor became a member of the Belizean Grove, an invitation-only women's group modeled after the men's Bohemian Grove.[252] On June 19, 2009, Sotomayor resigned from the Belizean Grove after Republican politicians voiced concerns over the group's membership policy.[253]\nSotomayor has maintained a public presence, mostly through making speeches, since joining the federal judiciary and throughout her time on the Supreme Court.[254][255] She gave over 180 speeches between 1993 and 2009, about half of which either focused on issues of ethnicity or gender or were delivered to minority or women's groups.[254] While on the Supreme Court she has been invited to give commencement addresses at a number of universities including New York University (2012),[256] Yale University (2013),[257] and the University of Puerto Rico (2014).[255][258] Her speeches have tended to give a more defined picture of her worldview than her rulings on the bench.[169] The themes of her speeches have often focused on ethnic identity and experience, the need for diversity, and America's struggle with the implications of its diverse makeup.[169] She has also presented her career achievements as an example of the success of affirmative action policies in university admissions, saying \"I am the perfect affirmative action baby\" in regard to her belief that her admission test scores were not comparable to those of her classmates.[32][33] During 2012 while already on the Supreme Court, Sotomayor made two appearances as herself on the children's television program Sesame Street, explaining what a vocational career is in general and then demonstrating how a judge hears a case.[259][260]\nSotomayor long lived in Greenwich Village in New York City and had few financial assets other than her home.[169] She enjoys shopping, traveling, and giving gifts and helps support her mother and her mother's husband in Florida.[261] Regarding her short financial disclosure reports prior to her Supreme Court nomination, she has said, \"When you don't have money, it's easy. There isn't anything there to report.\"[52] As a federal judge, she is entitled to a pension equal to her full salary upon retirement.[261] Upon joining the Supreme Court, she took up residence in Washington but sorely missed the faster-paced life of New York.[59] After renting in the Cleveland Park neighborhood for three years, in 2012 she purchased a condominium in the U Street Corridor.[262] She said, \"I picked [that area] because it's mixed. I walk out and I see all kinds of people, which is the environment I grew up in and the environment I love.\"[59]\nShe takes several daily insulin injections,[263] and her diabetes is considered to be well controlled.[264] Sotomayor does not belong to a Catholic parish or attend Mass, but does attend church for important occasions.[3] She has said, \"I am a very spiritual person [though] maybe not traditionally religious in terms of Sunday Mass every week, that sort of thing. The trappings are not important to me, but, yes, I do believe in God. And, yes, I do believe in the commandments.\"[59]\nShe maintains ties with Puerto Rico, visiting once or twice a year, speaking there occasionally, and visiting cousins and other relatives who still live in the Mayagüez area.[10][11][14] She has long stressed her ethnic identity, saying in 1996, \"Although I am an American, love my country and could achieve its opportunity of succeeding at anything I worked for, I also have a Latina soul and heart, with the magic that carries.\"[24] She was a member of the National Council of La Raza, now UnidosUS, from 1998 to 2004.[265]\nSotomayor said of the years following her divorce, that \"I have found it difficult to maintain a relationship while I've pursued my career.\"[68] She has talked of herself as \"emotionally withdrawn\" and lacking \"genuine happiness\" when living by herself; after becoming a judge, she said she would not date lawyers.[66] In 1997, she was engaged to New York construction contractor Peter White, but the relationship had ended by 2000.[9][66]\nIn July 2010, Sotomayor signed a contract with Alfred A. Knopf to publish a memoir about the early part of her life.[266] She received an advance of nearly $1.2 million for the work,[267] which was published in January 2013 and titled My Beloved World[59] (Mi mundo adorado in the simultaneously published Spanish edition). It focuses on her life up to 1992, with recollections of growing up in housing projects in New York and descriptions of the challenges she faced.[59] It received good reviews, with Michiko Kakutani of The New York Times describing it as \"a compelling and powerfully written memoir about identity and coming of age. ... It's an eloquent and affecting testament to the triumph of brains and hard work over circumstance, of a childhood dream realized through extraordinary will and dedication.\"[268] She staged a book tour to promote the work,[269] and it debuted atop the New York Times Best Seller List.[270]\nOn December 31, 2013, Sotomayor pressed the ceremonial button and led the final 60-second countdown at the Times Square New Year's Eve ball drop, being the first United States Supreme Court justice to perform the task.[271][272]\nIn 2020, Justice Sotomayor was reportedly targeted by the same gunman, an angry lawyer, who entered U.S. District Court Judge Esther Salas's home, shooting her husband and killing her son. The gunman had subsequently killed himself, after which his detailed planning notes regarding Sotomayor were found.[273]\nIn January 2021, Sonia Sotomayor swore in Kamala Harris as the Vice President of the United States. It was a considered historic as Sotomayor is the first Woman of Color to serve on the Supreme Court and Harris is the first Woman, African-American, and Asian American Vice President[274]\nSotomayor has received honorary law degrees from Lehman College (1999),[104] Princeton University (2001),[104] Brooklyn Law School (2001),[104] Pace University School of Law (2003),[275] Hofstra University (2006),[84] Northeastern University School of Law (2007),[276] Howard University (2010),[277] St. Lawrence University (2010),[278] Paris Nanterre University (2010),[279] New York University (2012),[256] Yale University (2013),[257] and the University of Puerto Rico at Río Piedras (2014).[258]\nShe was elected a member of the American Philosophical Society in 2002.[280]  She was given the Outstanding Latino Professional Award in 2006 by the Latino/a Law Students Association.[281] In 2008, Esquire magazine included Sotomayor on its list of \"The 75 Most Influential People of the 21st Century\".[282] In 2013, Sotomayor won the Woodrow Wilson Award at her alma mater Princeton University.[283]\nIn June 2010, the Bronxdale Houses development, where Sotomayor grew up, was renamed after her. The Justice Sonia Sotomayor Houses and Justice Sonia Sotomayor Community Center comprise 28 buildings with some 3,500 residents. While many New York housing developments are named after well-known people, this was only the second to be named after a former resident.[284]  In 2011, the Sonia M. Sotomayor Learning Academies, a public high school complex in Los Angeles, was named after her.[285]\nIn 2013, a painting featuring her, Sandra Day O'Connor, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and Elena Kagan was unveiled at the Smithsonian's National Portrait Gallery in Washington, D.C.[286]\nIn May 2015 she received the Katharine Hepburn medal from Bryn Mawr College.[287]\nIn 2019, she was inducted into the National Women's Hall of Fame.[288]",
