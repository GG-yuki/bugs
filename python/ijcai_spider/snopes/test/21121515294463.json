Even after adjusting for inflation, median income has risen 115% for married couples and 112% for nonmarried persons. A married couple is aged 65 or older if the husband is aged 65 or older or if the husband is aged 54 or younger and the wife is 65 or older.\nSocial Security benefits—the most common source of income for married couples and nonmarried persons aged 65 or older in 1962—are now almost universal. The proportion of the aged population with asset income—the next most common source—is similar to that in 1962. Over the 48-year period, receipt of private pensions has tripled, and receipt of government pensions has increased by more than 50%. The proportion of couples and nonmarried persons aged 65 or older who had earnings was smaller in 2010 than in 1962.\nIn 1962, Social Security, private and government employee pensions, income from assets, and earnings made up only 84% of the aggregate total income of couples and nonmarried persons aged 65 or older, compared with 96% in 2010. The shares from Social Security, private pensions, and government employee pensions have increased since 1962. The share from earnings in 2010 is about the same as it was in 1962, while the share from asset income is lower.\nIn 2010, 88% of married couples and 85% of nonmarried persons aged 65 or older received Social Security benefits. Social Security was the major source of income (providing at least 50% of total income) for 53% of aged beneficiary couples and 74% of aged nonmarried beneficiaries. It was 90% or more of income for 23% of aged beneficiary couples and 46% of aged nonmarried beneficiaries. Total income excludes withdrawals from savings and nonannuitized IRAs or 401(k) plans; it also excludes in-kind support, such as food stamps and housing and energy assistance.\nThe aged poor are those with income below the poverty line. The near poor have income greater than or equal to the poverty line and less than 125% of the poverty line. Nonmarried women and minorities have the highest poverty rates, ranging from 15.8% to 18.0%. Married persons have the lowest poverty rates, with 4.2% poor and 3.1% near poor. Overall, 9.0% are poor and 5.7% are near poor.\nPeople contribute to Social Security through payroll taxes or self-employment taxes, as required by the Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) and the Self-Employment Contributions Act (SECA). The maximum taxable amount is updated annually on the basis of increases in the average wage. Of the 158 million workers with earnings in Social Security–covered employment in 2011, 6% had earnings that equaled or exceeded the maximum amount subject to taxes, compared with 3% when the program began and a peak of 36% in 1965. About 83% of earnings in covered employment were taxable in 2011, compared with 92% in 1937.\nThe percentage of persons aged 20 or older who are insured for benefits has remained the same for the past several years. To be fully insured, a worker must have at least one work credit (quarter of coverage) for each year elapsed after age 21 (but no earlier than 1950) and before the year in which he or she attains age 62, becomes disabled, or dies. The maximum number of work credits needed to be fully insured is 40. An individual is said to be permanently insured if he or she has earned 40 work credits. To be insured for disability, the worker must be fully insured and have at least 20 work credits during the last 40 calendar quarters. (Requirements for disability-insured status are somewhat different for persons younger than age 31.) Disability benefits are available up to full retirement age (FRA).\nAlthough men are more likely than women to be insured, the gender gap is shrinking. The proportion of men who are insured has remained essentially stable, with 90% fully insured and 80% insured for disability. By contrast, the proportion of women who are insured has increased dramatically—from 63% to 85% fully insured and from 41% to 73% insured for disability.\nBenefits were awarded to about 5.6 million persons; of those, 46% were retired workers and 18% were disabled workers. The remaining 36% were survivors or the spouses and children of retired or disabled workers. These awards represent not only new entrants to the benefit rolls but also persons already on the rolls who become entitled to a different benefit, particularly conversions of disabled-worker benefits to retired-worker benefits at full retirement age.\nAwards to retired workers have increased considerably over the past four decades, but proportionately much less than awards to disabled workers. The annualized rate of increase over the period from 1971 to 2011 is 1.6% for retired workers and 2.2% for disabled workers. The annual number of awards to retired workers rose from 1.4 million in 1971 to 2.6 million in 2011, while for disabled workers it increased from 416,000 in 1971 to 1.0 million in 2011.\nMore than 55 million beneficiaries were in current-payment status, that is, they were being paid a benefit. Sixty-four percent of those beneficiaries were retired workers and 15% were disabled workers. The remaining 21% were survivors or the spouses and children of retired or disabled workers.\nBenefits payable to workers who retire at the full retirement age and to disabled workers are equal to 100% of the PIA (subject to any applicable deductions). At the full retirement age, widow(er)s' benefits are also payable at 100% of the insured worker's PIA. Nondisabled widow(er)s can receive reduced benefits at age 60. Disabled widow(er)s can receive reduced benefits at age 50. Spouses, children, and parents receive a smaller proportion of the worker's PIA than do widow(er)s.\nAbout four-fifths of all OASDI beneficiaries in current-payment status were aged 62 or older, including 22 percent aged 75–84 and 10 percent aged 85 or older. About 15 percent were persons aged 18–61 receiving benefits as disabled workers, survivors, or dependents. Another 6 percent were children under age 18.\nThe average age of disabled-worker beneficiaries in current-payment status has declined substantially since 1960, when DI benefits first became available to persons younger than age 50. In that year, the average age of a disabled worker was 57.2 years. The rapid drop in average age in the following years reflects a growing number of awards to workers under 50. By 1995, the average age had fallen to a low of 49.8, and by 2011, it had risen to 53.0. By contrast, the average age of retired workers has changed little over time, rising from 72.4 in 1960 to 73.7 in 2011.\nOf all adults receiving monthly Social Security benefits, 44% were men and 56% were women. Seventy-nine percent of the men and 62% of the women received retired-worker benefits. About one-sixth of the women received survivor benefits.\nAmong retired and disabled workers who collected benefits based on their own work records, men received a higher average monthly benefit than did women. For those with benefits based on another person's work record (spouses and survivors), women had higher average benefits.\nThe proportion of women among retired-worker beneficiaries has quadrupled since 1940. The percentage climbed from 12% in 1940 to 47% in 1980, 48% in 1990, and 49% in 2011. The proportion of women among disabled-worker beneficiaries has more than doubled since 1957, when DI benefits first became payable. The percentage rose steadily from 19% in 1957 to 35% in 1990 and 48% in 2011.\nThe proportion of women aged 62 or older who are receiving benefits as dependents (that is, on the basis of their husbands' earnings record only) has been declining—from 57% in 1960 to 25% in 2011. At the same time, the proportion of women with dual entitlement (that is, paid on the basis of both their own earnings records and those of their husbands) has been increasing—from 5% in 1960 to 27% in 2011.\nNearly 3.4 million children under age 18 and students aged 18–19 received OASDI benefits. Children of deceased workers had the highest average payments, in part because they are eligible to receive monthly benefits based on 75% of the worker's PIA, compared with 50% for children of retired or disabled workers. Overall, the average monthly benefit amount for children was $524.\nThe Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program provides income support to needy persons aged 65 or older, blind or disabled adults, and blind or disabled children. Eligibility requirements and federal payment standards are nationally uniform. SSI replaced the former federal/state adult assistance programs in the 50 states and the District of Columbia.\nPayments under SSI began in January 1974, with 3.2 million persons receiving federally administered payments. By December 1974, this number had risen to nearly 4 million and remained at about that level until the mid-1980s, then rose steadily, reaching nearly 6 million in 1993 and 7 million by the end of 2004. As of December 2011, the number of recipients was about 8.1 million. Of this total, almost 4.8 million were between the ages of 18 and 64, 2.1 million were aged 65 or older, and 1.3 million were under age 18.\nThe average monthly federally administered SSI payment was $502. Payments varied by age group, ranging from an average of $601 for recipients aged under 18 to $403 for those aged 65 or older. The maximum federal benefit rate in December 2011 was $674 for an individual and $1,011 for a couple, plus any applicable state supplementation.\nA total of 8.1 million persons received federally administered SSI payments. The majority received federal SSI only. States have the option of supplementing the federal benefit rate and are required to do so if that rate is less than the income the recipient would have had under the former state program.\nFifteen percent of SSI recipients received benefits on the basis of age, the rest on the basis of disability. Twenty-five percent of the recipients were aged 65 or older. In the SSI program, a disabled recipient is still classified as \"disabled\" after reaching age 65. In the OASDI program, DI beneficiaries are converted to the retirement program when they attain full retirement age.\nThe proportion of SSI recipients aged 65 or older has declined from 61% in January 1974 to 25% in December 2011. The overall long-term growth of the SSI program has occurred because of an increase in the number of disabled recipients, most of whom are under age 65.\nOverall, 54% of the approximately 8.1 million SSI recipients were women, but that percentage varied greatly by age group. Women accounted for 68% of the 2.1 million recipients aged 65 or older, 54% of the 4.8 million recipients aged 18–64, and 34% of the 1.3 million recipients under age 18.\nOver fifty-six percent of SSI recipients aged 65 or older received OASDI benefits, as did 31.3% of those aged 18–64 and 7.6% of those under age 18. Other types of unearned income, such as income from assets, were reported most frequently among those under age 18 (20.3%) and those aged 65 or older (11.6%). Earned income was most prevalent (4.8%) among those aged 18–64.\nIn 1974, when the program began, 70,900 blind and disabled children were receiving SSI. That number increased to 955,000 in 1996, declined to 847,000 in 2000, and is now 1,277,122. The relatively high average payment to children (compared with payments made to blind and disabled adults) is due in part to a limited amount of other countable income. The spike in average monthly benefits in 1992 is due to retroactive payments resulting from the Sullivan v. Zebley decision. As of December 2011, blind and disabled children were receiving SSI payments averaging $601.\nAbout 60.4 million people received a payment from Social Security. Most (52.3 million) received OASDI benefits only, about 5.4 million received SSI only, and 2.7 million received payments from both programs.\nBenefits were paid to 39.1 million people aged 65 or older. Nearly 1.2 million received both OASDI and SSI.\nPayments were made to 12.4 million people aged 18–64 on the basis of their own disability. Sixty-two percent received disability payments from the OASDI program only, 27% received payments from the SSI program only, and 11% received payments from both programs.\nSocial Security is largely a pay-as-you-go program. Most of the payroll taxes collected from today's workers are used to pay benefits to today's recipients. In 2011, the Old-Age and Survivors Insurance and Disability Insurance Trust Funds collected $805.1 billion in revenues. Of that amount, 82.8% was from payroll tax contributions and reimbursements from the General Fund of the Treasury and 3.0% was from income taxes on Social Security benefits. Interest earned on the government bonds held by the trust funds provided the remaining 14.2% of income. Assets increased in 2011 because total income exceeded expenditures for benefit payments and administrative expenses.\nThe 2012 Trustees Report projects that the number of retired workers will grow rapidly, as members of the post–World War II baby boom continue to reach early retirement age, and will double in fewer than 30 years. People are also living longer, and the birth rate is low. As a result, the Trustees project that the ratio of 2.9 workers paying Social Security taxes to each person collecting benefits in 2011 will fall to 2.0 to 1 in 2034. Tax and other noninterest income was not enough to cover program cost in 2010 and 2011, and the 2012 Trustees Report projects that this pattern will continue for at least 75 years. However, the Trustees also project that redemption of trust fund assets will be sufficient to allow for full payment of scheduled benefits through 2032.\nSocial Security is not sustainable over the long term at current benefit and tax rates. Beginning in 2010 and continuing in 2011, the program paid more in benefits and expenses than it collected in taxes and other noninterest income, and the 2012 Trustees Report projects this pattern to continue for the next 75 years. The Trustees estimate that the trust funds will be exhausted by 2033. At that point, payroll taxes and other income will flow into the fund but will be sufficient to pay only 75% of program costs. As reported in the 2012 Trustees Report, the projected shortfall over the next 75 years is 2.67% of taxable payroll.\nThis website is produced and published at U.S. taxpayer expense.",

Neither the length of time persons described by Subsection (a), (c), (d), (e), (f), or (g) of this section received a retirement or disability pension, whether under the old plan, Plan A, the combined pension plan or Plan B, nor the amount of any benefits paid to the person shall have any effect on the pension service earned by the person.  No pension service may be earned while on service retirement or disability retirement, or when the person was not on active service.  Except as provided by Sections 5.08 and 5.09 of this article, a person described by Subsection (a), (c), (d), (e), (f), or (g) of this section may not be allowed to contribute to the fund in order to receive pension service for the time the person was not on active service, regardless of whether the person was actually receiving a pension.\n(i)  The effective date of Group B membership for a person who becomes a Group B member pursuant to Section 5.01(e) of this article is the date on which written application for Group B membership is filed with the executive director.\nSec. 5.03.

If, however, the member had withdrawn the person's contributions and did not replace the previously withdrawn contributions as required by Section 4.04 of this article, the member forfeits any pension service attributable to any period of time for which the respective contributions were not repaid.\n(d)  If a member is assigned, for any period, to a job-sharing program or any similar work schedule that is considered by the member's department to be less than a full-time work schedule, the member's pension service is determined by multiplying the pension service that could have been earned for full-time work during the period by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of hours the member actually worked during the period and the denominator of which is the number of hours the member would have worked during the period if the member had been working a full-time work schedule.  This proration may not affect the computation of pension service for a member during any period the member is on leave:\n(1)  because of an illness or injury; or\n(2)  receiving periodic payments of workers' compensation.\n(e)  Notwithstanding any other provision in this section, a member may not receive pension service attributable to nonqualified service to the extent the pension service would result in either more than five years of permissive service attributable to nonqualified service being taken into account, or any permissive service being taken into account before the member has completed at least five years of active service.

PURCHASE OF PENSION SERVICE BY GROUP B MEMBERS.  (a)  A Group B member who is on active service and has previously elected not to become a contributing member of the old plan or Plan A may purchase pension service from the fund for that period during which the member performed active service with either department until the effective date of the member's Group B membership.  No pension service may be given to the Group B member except to the extent that payment is made for the pension service in accordance with Subsection (d) of this section.\n(b)  Payment for the purchase of pension service under Subsection (a) of this section shall be equal to the amount of contributions the Group B member would have made to the old plan and Plan A had the member been a contributing member of either of the plans during the period for which the pension service is being purchased, plus interest calculated in accordance with procedures adopted by the board from time to time.\n(c)  Subject to Subsection (d) of this section, a Group B member who is on active service may repay the fund all or a portion of the employee contributions withdrawn by an alternate payee pursuant to the terms of a qualified domestic relations order with interest, calculated at the interest rate from time to time used in the pension system's actuarial rate of return assumptions, compounded annually, on the contributions for the period from the date the contributions were withdrawn until the date the principal and accrued interest are repaid, and receive pension service as a Group B member, in accordance with Subsection (d) of this section, for the period for which the contributions and interest were paid.\n(d)   If payment of the entire amount of pension service a member is entitled to under Subsection (a) or (c) of this section or under Section 4.04(h-1) of this article is not completed by the earlier of the date the Group B member begins participation in DROP or the date the member leaves active service, pension service will be provided only for the number of full years of pension service that the contributions and interest paid under those provisions will purchase, computed based on the most recent years for which the member was entitled to purchase pension service.  Except for pension service that is picked up by the city under the authority of Section 414(h)(2) of the code, a fractional year of pension service may be purchased only if less than a full year of pension service is available for purchase.\n(e)  The amounts paid but insufficient to purchase one or more whole years of pension service that remain available for purchase, including any interest paid by the Group B member, must be returned to the Group B member or, if the Group B member has died, to the Group B member's designee, without any accrued interest on the returned money.\n(f)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, any amounts that have been picked up and paid by the city may not be paid to a member or designee, and the member shall be given credit for all years, and fractions of years, of pension service that can be purchased with the picked-up contributions.\nSec. 5.08.  MEMBERS IN UNIFORMED SERVICES.

Section 4301 et seq.), as amended.\n(a-1)  A member who is reemployed by the city after an absence due to service in the uniformed services shall receive contributions, benefits, and pension service that are no less favorable than those required by Section 414(u) of the code in accordance with the procedure described by Subsection (c) of this section.\n(b)  To the extent a provision of this section that was in effect before November 25, 1996, would provide a member who was on active service with the pension system before November 25, 1996, with greater rights, the prior provision of this section applies.\n(c)  Payment for credit for pension service under this section shall be made in accordance with Section 5.07 of this article and a uniform and nondiscriminatory procedure adopted by the board.\nSec. 5.09.  NON-UNIFORMED LEAVE OF ABSENCE.  (a)  An \"authorized non-uniformed leave of absence\" means any leave of absence that meets one of the following requirements:\n(1)  the leave of absence was unpaid and granted by the member's department in accordance with the federal Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (29 U.S.C. Section 2601 et seq.); or\n(2)  the leave of absence was unpaid and was an official leave authorized and certified by the chief of the member's department as being beneficial to the department.\n(b)  Subject to the requirements of this section and any procedures adopted by the board, a member may receive pension service for time spent away from the member's department on an authorized non-uniformed leave of absence.  To receive pension service under this section, the member must file with the executive director a written application to pay to the fund both:\n(1)  the member contributions the member would have made to the fund had the member remained on active service and had there been no change in the member's position or hours of work during the period of the authorized non-uniformed leave of absence; and\n(2)  the contributions the city would have made to the fund on the member's behalf had the member remained on active service and had there been no change in the member's position or hours of work during the period of the authorized non-uniformed leave of absence.\n(b-1)  Contributions made under Subsection (b)(2) of this section may not be refunded to the member.\n(b-2)  The written application described by Subsection (b) of this section must be filed before the member's authorized non-uniformed leave of absence begins, unless the pension system determines that it would not be reasonable to expect the member to file the application before the authorized non-uniformed leave of absence begins, in which case the application must be filed as soon as circumstances permit, as determined by the pension system.\n(b-3)  To receive pension service under this section, the following additional conditions must also be met:\n(1)  if the member's contribution rate, the city's contribution rate, or both the member's and city's contribution rates change before the end of the member's authorized non-uniformed leave of absence, the percentage required to be paid by the member also changes, so that the amount paid by the member in accordance with this section always equals the amount that would have been contributed by the member, and by the city on the member's behalf had the member remained on active service;\n(2)  payment of contributions as set forth in Subsection (b) of this section shall begin coincident with the beginning of the applicable authorized non-uniformed leave of absence and shall be made monthly to the executive director for deposit in the fund, unless the board authorizes the deferment of the payments, in which case the payments must include interest calculated in accordance with Subsection (b-4) of this section;\n(3)  no pension service will be granted to the member until the member returns to active service, and if the member does not return to active service, the contributions paid, including any interest paid, will be returned to the member except as provided by Subsection (c) of this section;\n(4)  if the board authorizes the deferment of the payments under Subdivision (2) of this subsection, the payment must be made either by authorizing the deduction of pro rata portions of the total amount due from the member's salary over a one-year period, or by cash payment made to the executive director within one year after the date of the member's return to active service, except that the board may approve a longer period for making the payment if it finds that the one-year limit would work a financial hardship on the member;\n(5)  the member must return to active service within 90 days after the date the member's authorized non-uniformed leave of absence expires, or if the member's authorized non-uniformed leave of absence does not have a fixed expiration date, within a reasonable time to be determined by the board, or the member forfeits the right to pay for the leave time; and\n(6)  no member may ever be allowed to pay leave of absence contributions under this section for any time in excess of the time actually spent on an authorized non-uniformed leave of absence.\n(b-4)  For purposes of Subsection (b-3)(2) of this section, interest is calculated from the date the member's payment was first due, at the interest rate from time to time used in the pension system's actuarial rate of return assumptions, compounded annually until the date the principal and accrued interest are repaid in full.\n(c)(1)  If a member of the combined pension plan is disabled or dies while on an authorized non-uniformed leave of absence, the member or the member's designee is entitled to a refund of contributions pursuant to Section 4.04 of this article or the member or the member's qualified survivors are entitled to benefits under the provisions of this article, to the extent applicable.\n(2)  A member who is disabled or dies while on an authorized non-uniformed leave of absence pursuant to this section may receive no pension service for any portion of the period of the leave,  except that if the member had, before the member's disability or death, paid for contributions while on an authorized non-uniformed leave of absence in accordance with this section, the member shall receive pension service for the leave time actually paid for at the time of the member's disability or death.  The member may receive no pension service for any portion of the period of leave for which contributions were not paid to the executive director for deposit in the fund.\nPART 6. BENEFITS\nSec. 6.01.  GROUP A RETIREMENT PENSION.  (a)  A Group A member must have 20 years of pension service to be eligible for a Group A retirement pension under this section.  A member's benefit election under this section, once approved, is irrevocable.\n(a-1)  If a Group A pensioner returns to active service as a police officer or fire fighter with the city, the person's Group A retirement pension ceases until that person again leaves active service with the city.\n(a-2)  If a Group A pensioner resumes employment with the city in a capacity other than as a police officer or fire fighter, the pensioner's Group A retirement pension continues during the period of employment, except the pensioner may not accrue additional credit for pension service during this period.  Additional credit for pension service does not accrue during any period in which a Group A pensioner becomes employed by the city unless the additional credit is attributable to active service as a police officer or fire fighter with the city.\n(b)  At age 50 a Group A member is eligible to begin drawing a monthly Group A retirement pension.  A monthly Group A retirement pension equals 50 percent of the base pay per month, plus 50 percent of any longevity pay the Group A member was receiving at the time the member left active service.  Although the number of years used in the computation of longevity pay remains fixed at the earlier of the time a Group A member leaves active service or begins participation in DROP, the monthly rate of longevity pay used in this computation is subject to change in the event of an amendment to the state law governing longevity pay.  The monthly Group A retirement pension benefits of Group A pensioners shall be adjusted from time to time in a like manner.\n(c)  In addition to the amount computed under Subsection (b) of this section, at age 50, a Group A member is eligible to begin drawing an annual Group A retirement pension.  An annual retirement pension equals 50 percent of the difference between the annualized amount of city service incentive pay and longevity pay.  In determining city service incentive pay and longevity pay for purposes of this element of the annual Group A retirement pension only the following apply:\n(1)  City service incentive pay is calculated in the same manner as the city service incentive pay is calculated for members currently on active service except:\n(A)  the annual salary of a Group A pensioner used in calculating city service incentive pay is determined on the basis of the last city civil service rank held by the Group A pensioner when the person was on active service;  however, if the rank no longer exists, its closest equivalent shall be determined by the board and applied; and\n(B)  the annual salary of a Group A pensioner as determined under Paragraph (A) of this subdivision shall be that amount in effect on the last day of September of each year the Group A pensioner's annual retirement pension is calculated.\n(2)  Longevity pay shall be calculated as 12 times the amount of monthly longevity pay the Group A pensioner was receiving at the time such person left active service, except that the monthly rate of longevity pay used in this computation is subject to change if an amendment to state law governing longevity pay is enacted.\n(d)  The element of annual retirement pension computed under Subsection (c)(1) of this section is subject to the following limitations:\n(1)  it shall be prorated for the year in which the pensioner begins receiving a retirement pension;\n(2)  it shall be payable only to those Group A pensioners who, as Group A members on active service, received city service incentive pay and who receive a monthly Group A retirement pension as determined under Subsection (b) of this section on the last day of September of each year; and\n(3)  it shall be paid to Group A pensioners as long as the city continues to pay city service incentive pay to Group A members on active service.\n(4)  Notwithstanding Subsections (b) and (c) of this section, a Group A member with a minimum of 20 years of pension service may apply for an actuarially reduced retirement pension to begin no earlier than when the member attains age 45 but before the member attains age 50.  The Group A member who has made an application may receive a retirement pension calculated under Subsections (b) and (c) of this section reduced by two-thirds of one percent per month for each whole calendar month the benefit is payable before the month in which the Group A member attains age 50.\n(e)  At age 55 a Group A member is eligible to begin drawing a monthly retirement pension computed as follows:\n(1)(A)  at the rate of three percent of base pay for each year, prorated for fractional years, of pension service, with a maximum of 32 years of pension service, or 96 percent of base pay; or\n(B)  if the Group A member had 34 or more years of pension service as of April 30, 1990, then the member's retirement pension is calculated at the rate calculated under the terms of the combined pension plan in effect on April 30, 1990, if the resulting amount would be greater than the amount calculated under Paragraph (A) of this subdivision; plus\n(2)  one-half of the longevity pay the Group A member was receiving at the time the person left active service; plus\n(3)  1/24th, without subsequent adjustment, of the annualized amount of the city service incentive pay the Group A member received at the time the person left active service.\n(f)   For purposes of Subsection (e) of this section, base pay and longevity pay are the amounts in effect on the earlier of the date the member begins participation in DROP or the date benefits are to begin, without subsequent adjustment.\n(g)  Notwithstanding Subsection (e) of this section, a Group A member with 20 or more years of pension service may apply for an actuarially reduced Group A retirement pension beginning on or after the date the Group A member attains age 50 but before the person attains age 55.  The Group A member may receive a retirement pension calculated under Subsection (e) of this section reduced by two-thirds of one percent per month for each whole calendar month the benefit is payable before the month in which the Group A member attains age 55.\n(h)  Entitlement to the Group A retirement pension described by this section is subject to the following conditions:\n(1)  a written application must be filed with the executive director;\n(2)  the grant of a Group A retirement pension by the board must be made at a meeting of the board held during the month the retirement pension is to become effective, or as soon after that as administratively possible; and\n(3)  the Group A member must no longer be on active service.\nSec. 6.02.

(a)  If a Group B member has accrued five or more years of pension service, is no longer on active service with the department, has not withdrawn the member's contributions, and otherwise meets the age and pension service requirements under the applicable provision of this section, the member may apply for a Group B retirement pension under this section.  A member's benefit election application under a provision of this section, once approved, is irrevocable.\n(a-1)  If a Group B pensioner returns to active service as a police officer or fire fighter with the city, the person's Group B retirement pension ceases until that person again leaves active service with the city.\n(a-2)  If a Group B pensioner resumes employment with the city in a capacity other than as a police officer or fire fighter, the pensioner's Group B retirement pension continues during the period of employment except the pensioner may not accrue additional credit for pension service during this period.  Additional credit for pension service does not accrue during any period in which a Group B pensioner becomes employed by the city unless the additional credit is attributable to active service as a police officer or fire fighter with the city.\n(b)  A Group B member who began active service before March 1, 2011, and who has attained at least 50 years of age, or who began active service on or after March 1, 2011, and has attained at least 58 years of age, and who otherwise meets the requirements of Subsection (a) of this section may elect to receive a Group B retirement pension that shall be calculated as follows:\n(1)  for a member who began active service before March 1, 2011, the member's retirement pension shall be the sum of:\n(A)  the number of years of pension service before September 1, 2017, prorated for fractional years, times three percent of the average computation pay determined over the 36 consecutive months of pension service in which the Group B member received the highest computation pay; plus\n(B)  the number of years of pension service on or after September 1, 2017, prorated for fractional years, times the applicable percentage prescribed by Subsection (b-1) of this section of the average computation pay determined over the 60 consecutive months of pension service in which the Group B member received the highest computation pay; or\n(2)  for a member who began active service on or after March 1, 2011, the member's retirement pension shall be the number of years of pension service, prorated for fractional years, times 2.5 percent of the average computation pay determined over the 60 consecutive months of pension service in which the member received the highest computation pay.\n(b-1)  For purposes of Subsection (b)(1)(B) of this section, the applicable percentage is based on the age of the Group B member when the member's retirement pension begins as set forth below:\n(b-2)  Days during which the member earned no pension service due to a termination of active service or otherwise must be disregarded in determining the 36 or 60 consecutive months of highest computation pay under Subsection (b)(1) or (2) of this section, as appropriate.  The pension benefit calculated under Subsection (b) of this section may not exceed the greater of:\n(1)  90 percent of the member's average computation pay determined under the applicable subsection; or\n(2)  the vested and accrued benefit of a member as determined on August 31, 2017.\n(c)  Except as provided by Subsection (c-2) of this section, a Group B member who has either attained at least 45 years of age on September 1, 2017, or who attains at least 53 years of age after September 1, 2017, and who otherwise meets the requirements of Subsection (a) of this section may elect to receive an actuarially reduced Group B retirement pension calculated in accordance with Subsection (c-1) of this section:\n(1)  not earlier than the member's 45th or 53rd birthday, as applicable; and\n(2)  not later than the member's 50th or 58th birthday, as applicable.\n(c-1)  Except as provided by Subsection (c-2) of this section and subject to Section 6.021 of this article, a Group B member who applies for an actuarially reduced Group B retirement pension under Subsection (c) of this section shall receive a pension calculated under Subsection (b) of this section, reduced by two-thirds of one percent per month, for each whole calendar month the benefit is payable before the month in which the member attains:\n(1)  for members who attained at least 45 years of age on September 1, 2017, 50 years of age; or\n(2)  for members not described by Subdivision (1) of this subsection who attain at least 53 years of age after September 1, 2017, 58 years of age.\n(c-2)  Subject to Subsection (d-3) of this section and for purposes of Subsection (c-1) of this section, if a Group B member's pension benefit calculated under Subsection (b) of this section is equal to 90 percent of the member's average computation pay, the member is entitled to a Group B retirement pension under Subsection (c) of this section at 45 or 53 years of age, as applicable, that is not actuarially reduced as provided under Subsection (c-1) of this section.\n(d)  Except as provided by Subsection (d-2) of this section, a Group B member who has accrued 20 or more years of pension service and has been on active service at any time on or after January 1, 1999, may elect to apply for a Group B retirement pension beginning at any time after the Group B member leaves active service, regardless of age.

For purposes of this subsection, \"base pay\" is the amount in effect on the date compensation benefits under this section are to begin, without subsequent adjustment.\n(b-1)  Instead of receiving a periodic disability compensation benefit under Subsection (b) of this section, a Group A member who is entitled to periodic disability compensation benefits under this section may elect, before the benefits begin, to receive those benefits as a monthly benefit equal to 50 percent of the member's base pay adjusted from time to time to reflect changes in base pay that occur after the member began receiving a monthly compensation benefit under this section.\n(c)  A Group B member whose disability, as determined by the board, was caused by an injury or sickness incurred in the performance of the member's duty shall receive a monthly benefit equal to the disability pension under Sections 6.04(f), (f-1), (f-2), and (f-3) of this article except that if the member:\n(1)  does not have 20 years of pension service, the member is considered to have 20 years of pension service for the purposes of calculating the disability pension under that section; and\n(2)  has less than 36 or 60 consecutive months, as applicable, of employment with the department, the member's average computation pay will be computed based on all the member's computation pay, and days during which the member earned no pension service due to a termination of active service or otherwise must be disregarded in determining either the 36 or 60 consecutive months of highest computation pay.\n(d)  Redesignated as Sec. 6.055 by Acts 2017, 85th Leg., R.S., Ch. 318 (H.B. 3158), Sec. 1.35, eff.

If the pensioner did not file a tax return for the previous calendar year, the board may require other documentation reflecting the pensioner's occupation or earned income that the board determines appropriate.\n(c)  The pension system may waive the July 1 date under Subsection (b) of this section in lieu of one later in the same calendar year if the Group B pensioner provides the board with a true and complete copy of a grant of an extension of time for the filing of the person's tax return from the appropriate governmental agency or a true and complete copy of an extension request that results in any automatic extension.\n(d)  If, after evaluating the information received under Subsection (b) of this section, the board finds the Group B pensioner is or has been receiving earned income from one or more employments, including self-employment, during the preceding year, the board shall reduce future disability retirement payments to the Group B pensioner in accordance with the following formula:  $1 for each $1 that the sum of \"a\" + \"b\" is greater than \"c,\" where \"a\" is the earned income of the Group B pensioner attributable to the previous calendar year from the person's employments, \"b\" is the total amount of Group B disability retirement payments received by the Group B pensioner the previous calendar year, and \"c\" is the annualized amount of the average computation pay the Group B pensioner received as of the date the person left active service.\n(e)  For purposes of the computation under Subsection (d) of this section, the average computation pay shall be deemed increased at a rate of 2.75 percent, without compounding during the year, as of each January 1 that the Group B pensioner receives a Group B disability retirement payment.\nSec. 6.06.

If no legal guardian has been appointed, death benefits shall be delivered to one of the following persons, provided there is evidence that the person is a suitable person to receive and administer the benefits:\n(1)  the surviving spouse with whom the child resides; or\n(2)  the adult head of the household with whom the child resides, if the child does not reside with the surviving spouse.\n(j-1)  In accordance with Subsection (h) of this section, the recipient of a surviving child's death benefits under Subsection (j) of this section must use the death benefits to benefit the child.  The board may withhold payment of benefits to anyone, if presented with evidence that the death benefits are not being used to benefit the surviving child.\n(k)  Dependent parents of a primary party who are entitled to receive death benefits provided by this article may only receive the benefits for the remainder of the dependent parents' lives.\n(l)  The pension system may require all qualified survivors receiving death benefits to file a sworn statement with the executive director concerning the qualified survivor's eligibility to continue to receive death benefits at least once every two years, or at any other time the executive director considers a sworn statement to be appropriate to evidence the continued eligibility of the qualified survivor.   The board may withhold death benefits from any person who fails or refuses to file a statement when requested to do so.\n(m)  When the last qualified survivor of any primary party becomes ineligible to continue to receive death benefits, an amount equal to the excess, if any, of the total amount of all contributions made to the fund by the primary party while a member over the sum of all benefits paid to the primary party and all of the primary party's qualified survivors shall be paid in a lump sum to the last person to receive benefits as a qualified survivor or, if none exists, to the member's designee.  The total amount to be paid in benefits to the primary party and all qualified survivors shall never be less than the total amount of contributions the primary party made to the fund while a member.\n(n)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this section:\n(1)  death benefits awarded to an unmarried child who is a qualified survivor who is determined by the board to be disabled under the terms of Subsection (o-2) of this section may be paid to the trustee of a management trust, supplemental needs or special needs trust, or comparable trust established for the benefit of the child, if the trust meets the requirements set forth in a procedure adopted from time to time by the board; and\n(2)  as soon as practicable after the pension system has knowledge of an event listed in this subdivision, the pension system shall terminate payment of death benefits to a trust described by Subdivision (1) of this subsection effective on the earlier occurrence of the following events:\n(A)  the date as of which the child is determined by the board to no longer be disabled under the terms of this section;\n(B)  the date on which the child is lawfully married;\n(C)  the date on which the child is deceased;\n(D)  the date on which the pension system becomes aware that the assets of the trust are deemed to be the resources of the child under applicable federal or state laws or regulations; or\n(E)  if the trustee of the child's trust fails to provide a court of competent jurisdiction with an annual accounting of the child's trust, the date occurring six months after the date of the close of the trust's fiscal year.\n(o)  When a child who, as a qualified survivor, is entitled to receive death benefits under this article reaches the age of 19, the child may no longer participate in the division of the benefits, but the same undiminished child's share as determined by this section shall be paid to any remaining children who are qualified survivors who remain eligible to continue to receive death benefits.\n(o-1)  If benefits are no longer payable to the trust described in Subsection (n)(1) of this section in accordance with Subsection (n)(2) of this section, the benefits are divisible and payable to any remaining children who are qualified survivors who remain eligible to receive death benefits.\n(o-2)  If an unmarried child, after cessation of entitlement to death benefitsbecause of attainment of age 19, becomes disabled before age 23, the child is entitled to participate in the division of death benefits under this article.  Notwithstanding the preceding, all death benefits granted under this subsection are conditioned on the board finding that:\n(1)  the child is so physically or mentally disabled, either congenitally or through injury suffered or disease contracted, as to be unable to be self-supporting or to secure and hold gainful employment or pursue an occupation;\n(2)  the child is not married;\n(3)  the disability was not the result of an occupational injury for which the child received compensation equal to or greater than that provided under this article;\n(4)  the disability was not the result of an intentional self-inflicted injury or a chronic illness itself resulting from an addiction of the child through a protracted course of indulgence in alcohol, narcotics, or other substance abuse that was not coerced; and\n(5)  the disability did not occur as a result of the child's participation in the commission of a felony.\n(p)  If a child with a disability received or is receiving workers' compensation resulting from an occupational injury equal to an amount less than the death benefit to be provided under this section, the difference shall be paid out of the assets of the fund in the form otherwise payable as monthly benefits.  For purposes of Subsections (o), (o-1), and (o-2) of this section, if a lump sum is awarded for an injury, the fund's actuary may compute a corresponding monthly equivalent.  A finding relating to a child's disability is subject to periodic review and modification by the board.\n(q)  On the death or marriage of a child granted death benefits under this article, the death benefits shall cease being paid to that child;  however, the same undiminished child's share as determined by this section shall be uniformly distributed among any remaining unmarried children who are:\n(1)  under 19 years of age; or\n(2)  disabled as described by Subsection (o-2) of this section and entitled to death benefits as qualified survivors.\n(r)  A spouse of a primary party who married the primary party after the date the primary party terminated active service is not a qualified survivor and is entitled only to those death benefits, if applicable, provided under Section 6.063 of this article.\n(s)  Repealed by Acts 2017, 85th Leg., R.S., Ch. 318 (H.B. 3158), Sec. 1.52(4), eff.

(a)  Subject to Subsection (c) of this section, the surviving spouse of a primary party who was a member of the old plan, Plan A, or Plan B whose death benefits, also referred to as \"survivor benefits\" or \"widow benefits,\" terminated because of a remarriage of the surviving spouse that occurred before April 21, 1988, is entitled to receive death benefits, on a prospective basis only, as of the first day of the month following the month in which the executive director receives the application.\n(b)  The board shall make reasonable efforts to notify all known living surviving spouses who may be entitled to a reinstatement of benefits under this section.\n(c)  A surviving spouse's properly completed, board-approved application for reinstatement of death benefits under this section must be received by the executive director not later than the 180th day after the date the board completes, as determined by the board, the reasonable efforts required by Subsection (b) of this section.\n(d)  A surviving spouse's application for reinstatement of death benefits under this section constitutes the spouse's waiver of any claims against the pension system, the board, the executive director, or any other employee of the board or the pension system arising out of any claim for death benefits.\n(e)  This section may not be applied retroactively.  A surviving spouse may not receive death benefits attributable to periods before the executive director's receipt of a properly completed and board-approved application, and any benefit provided to a surviving spouse described in this section must be calculated as if the benefits had not terminated on the surviving spouse's remarriage notwithstanding the fact the reinstatement of benefits is not retroactive.\nSec. 6.062.  LUMP-SUM PAYMENT ON DEATH OF CERTAIN MEMBERS.  (a)  If an unmarried member dies while on active service and before beginning participation in DROP, the last person to receive benefits as the member's qualified survivor or, if the member does not have a qualified survivor living, the member's designee, shall be paid a lump-sum payment determined in accordance with this section if, at the time of the member's death, the member:\n(1)  had no qualified survivors; or\n(2)  only had qualified survivors who are children who become ineligible to receive death benefits before the benefits were paid for at least 120 consecutive months.\n(b)  The amount of the lump-sum payment under this section is the greater of:\n(1)  the payment that could have been provided under Section 6.06(m) of this article; or\n(2)  an amount equal to the actuarial equivalent of the remainder of the monthly benefits that would have been paid for the period from the last monthly benefit payment to the end of the 120 months, starting with the date of the first monthly benefit payment, if any.\n(c)  If no death benefit payments have been made with respect to the member, the amount of a monthly death benefit payment shall be considered to be the monthly death benefit that would have been paid if the member had died leaving only one dependent parent who was a qualified survivor.\n(d)  If a qualified survivor or designee is entitled to payment under both this section and Section 6.06(m) of this article, payments shall be made only under this section.\n(e)  The payment required under this section shall be made as soon as practicable after the later of the date:\n(1)  of the death of the member; or\n(2)  the last qualified survivor becomes ineligible to receive monthly death benefit payments.\nSec. 6.063.

On the death of the pensioner:\n(1)  the surviving spouse of a pensioner who made an election under Subsection (a)(1) of this section receives a pension that is equal to the reduced pension being received by the pensioner at the time of death; and\n(2)  a surviving spouse who is not a qualified survivor of a pensioner who made an election under Subsection (a)(2) of this section receives a pension that is 50 percent of the reduced pension being received by the pensioner at the time of death.\n(i)  A pensioner and surviving spouse receiving a death benefit payable under this section are eligible for adjustments under Sections 6.12 and 6.13 of this article, if the pensioner or surviving spouse, as applicable, is otherwise entitled to those adjustments, except that in each case the adjustment shall be calculated so that the total pension or death benefit paid is reduced by the same percentage the pensioner's pension is otherwise reduced under this section.\n(j)  A pensioner and surviving spouse receiving a death benefit payable under this section are not entitled to the minimum benefits provided under Section 6.10A, 6.10B, or 6.11 of this article.\n(k)  A surviving spouse receiving a death benefit payable under this section is not entitled to the special death benefit provided under Section 6.09 of this article.\n(l)  During a period in which there are two or more qualified survivors of a member who has made a joint and survivor annuity election under this section, the spousal benefit will be divided among the eligible survivors under Section 6.07 or 6.08 of this article, as applicable.\n(m)  A child's death benefit elected under Subsection (a)(3) of this section is treated the same way as a death benefit to a child who is a qualified survivor, except that it is based on the actuarially reduced pension.\nSec. 6.064.

If the deceased Group B member was previously eligible to elect whether to receive either a Group A or Group B retirement pension, the option to elect whether Group A or Group B death benefits are received shall be exercised by one of the following:\n(1)  a qualified survivor who is the spouse of the deceased Group B member described by this subsection;\n(2)  the person described in Section 6.06(g) or (j) of this article as the recipient of benefits on behalf of the deceased member's children who are qualified survivors, if no spouse is a qualified survivor; or\n(3)  the qualified survivors who are dependent parents of the deceased member, if there is neither a spouse nor children who are qualified survivors.\n(a-1)  A qualified survivor who receives Group A death benefits under Subsection (a) of this section is entitled to a ratable portion of a reimbursement from the fund in the same amount and manner determined under Section 5.03(d) of this article.

The annuity shall be distributed beginning as promptly as administratively feasible after the later of, as applicable:\n(1)  the date the member retires and is granted a retirement pension; or\n(2)  September 1, 2017.\n(e-1)  The board may adopt a shorter period for annuitizing DROP account balances under Subsection (e) of this section if the pension system's qualified actuary determines that the shorter period will not cause the pension system's amortization period to exceed 25 years.\n(e-2)  The annuitization of a DROP account under Subsection (e) of this section must reflect the accrual of interest on the amount in the DROP account as of September 1, 2017, over the annuitization period applied to the account under this section.  The interest rate applied under this subsection must be a rate as reasonably equivalent as practicable to the interest rate on a note issued by the United States Department of the Treasury or other federal treasury note with a duration that is reasonably comparable to the annuitization period applied to the account, as determined by the board.  The portion of an annuity attributable to amounts credited to a member's DROP account on or after September 1, 2017, may not reflect the accrual of this interest on annuitization.\n(e-3)  The board may by rule allow any person receiving an annuity from the annuitization of a DROP account under this section to:\n(1)  assign the distribution from the person's annuitized DROP account to a third party provided the pension system receives a favorable private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service ruling that such an assignment will not negatively impact the pension system's qualified plan status; and\n(2)  subject to Subsection (e-4) of this section, in the event of a financial hardship that was not reasonably foreseeable obtain a lump-sum distribution from the person's DROP account resulting in a corresponding reduction in the total number or in the amount of annuity payments.\n(e-4)  The board shall adopt rules necessary to implement Subsection (e-3)(2) of this section, including rules regarding what constitutes a financial hardship for purposes of that subdivision. In adopting the rules, the board shall provide flexibility to persons receiving an annuity from the annuitization of a DROP account.\n(f)  The board may adopt rules and policies relating to the administration of Subsections (e), (e-1), and (e-2) of this section if the rules and policies are:\n(1)  consistent with the qualification of the plan under Section 401 of the code; and\n(2)  in the best interest of the pension system.\n(f-1)  The DROP account of a member who begins participating in DROP on or after September 1, 2017, does not accrue interest.\n(g)  The provisions of Sections 6.06, 6.061, 6.062, 6.063, 6.07, and 6.08 of this article pertaining to death benefits of a qualified survivor do not apply to amounts held in a member's or pensioner's DROP account.  Instead, a member or pensioner who participates in DROP may designate a beneficiary to receive the annuity payments under this section over the remaining annuitization period in the event of the member's or pensioner's death subject to any rights provided under Subsection (e-3) of this section and in the manner allowed by Section 401(a)(9) of the code and any policy adopted by the board.  A member or pensioner who is or becomes married is considered to have designated the member's or pensioner's spouse as the member's or pensioner's beneficiary, notwithstanding any prior beneficiary designation, unless the member or pensioner has made a different designation in accordance with a policy adopted by the board.  If a member or pensioner does not have a spouse or the spouse predeceases the member or pensioner, the member's or pensioner's, as applicable, DROP account will be distributed to the member's or pensioner's, as applicable, designee.  Notwithstanding anything in this section to the contrary, if a member or pensioner has previously designated the member's or pensioner's spouse as the beneficiary or co-beneficiary of the DROP account and the member or pensioner and spouse are subsequently divorced, the divorce automatically results in the invalidation of the designation of the spouse as a beneficiary and, if there is no additional beneficiary designated, the member's or pensioner's DROP account shall be distributed as provided by Subsection (e) of this section.  If there are beneficiaries who survive the deceased member or pensioner, the surviving beneficiaries share equally in that portion that would have otherwise been payable to the former spouse.\n(g-1)  A member who becomes a DROP participant is ineligible for any disability benefits described by Section 6.03, 6.04, or 6.05 of this article, but is entitled to a retirement pension in accordance with Sections 6.01(b) and (c), Section 6.01(e), or Section 6.02 of this article, whichever is applicable, on termination from active service, and is also entitled to receive annuity payments in accordance with Subsection (e) of this section.\n(h)  The base pay or computation pay, whichever is applicable, in effect as of the effective date of a member's participation in DROP shall be used in calculating the member's retirement pension under Section 6.01 or 6.02 of this article.  A member who elects to participate in DROP does not accrue additional pension service for purposes of computing a retirement pension for any period after the effective date of the election.\n(i)  Repealed by Acts 2017, 85th Leg., R.S., Ch. 318 (H.B. 3158), Sec. 1.52(6), eff.

DEFERRED ANNUITIZATION OF CERTAIN DROP ACCOUNTS.  (a)  This section applies only to a pensioner who:\n(1)  before attaining 50 years of age:\n(A)  left active service; and\n(B)  was granted a service retirement pension under Section 6.01 or 6.02 of this article;\n(2)  since the pensioner's retirement has continued to receive substantially equal periodic payments, as determined under Section 72(t) of the code; and\n(3)  on September 1, 2017:\n(A)  is a DROP participant; and\n(B)  has not attained 59-1/2 years of age.\n(b)  Notwithstanding Section 6.14 of this article and solely to avoid the possibility of an early distribution tax penalty under Section 72(t)(4) of the code:\n(1)  a pensioner subject to this section may until the pensioner attains 59-1/2 years of age:\n(A)  subject to Subsection (c) of this section, continue to participate in DROP;\n(B)  have the same amount of the pensioner's service retirement pension credited to the pensioner's DROP account as has been credited since the pensioner's service retirement pension was initially granted; and\n(C)  defer annuitization of the pensioner's DROP account under Section 6.14(e) of this article; and\n(2)  once a pensioner subject to this section attains 59-1/2 years of age:\n(A)  the pensioner may not have any portion of the pensioner's service retirement pension credited to the pensioner's DROP account; and\n(B)  as soon as administratively feasible, the balance in the pensioner's DROP account shall be annuitized and distributed to the pensioner in accordance with Section 6.14(e) of this article.\n(c)  The DROP account of a pensioner who continues participation in DROP under Subsection (b)(1)(A) of this section does not accrue interest on and after September 1, 2017.\nSec. 6.15.  MEDICAL EXAMINATION.  (a)  The board may require the following pensioners receiving a disability pension or a periodic disability compensation benefit to appear and undergo a medical examination by the health director or, if the health director approves, by any licensed medical practitioner, to determine if the pensioner's disability continues or has been removed to the extent that the pensioner is able to resume duties with the department:\n(1)  any Group A pensioner who has served less than 20 years;\n(2)  any Group A pensioner who elected a Group A disability pension under Section 6.04 of this article, periodic disability compensation under Section 6.05 of this article, or a non-service-connected disability pension under Plan A or former Section 17(b)(2) of this article, and who had more than 20 years of pension service, but is less than 55 years of age; and\n(3)  any Group B pensioner who was granted a Group B disability pension under Section 6.04 of this article or periodic disability compensation under Section 6.05 of this article or a disability pension under the terms of Plan B and is less than 50 years of age.\n(b)  Any medical examination under this section is subject to the following conditions:\n(1)  Except as otherwise provided by this section, the board has complete discretion to require a pensioner to appear and undergo a medical examination as well as the time that may pass between examinations.  When it becomes clear to the board from reliable medical evidence that the disability is unequivocally permanent and is not expected to diminish, the board may waive subsequent examinations.\n(2)  A pensioner may not be required to undergo a medical examination more often than once in a six-month period, except that the board may order the pensioner to undergo an examination at any time if the board has reason to believe the pensioner's disability has been removed and that the pensioner may be able to resume duties with the pensioner's former department or if the pensioner requests to be allowed to return to duty.\n(3)  If a pensioner fails to undergo an examination after being notified by the board that the examination is required, the board may discontinue disability benefits until the pensioner has undergone the examination and the results of the examination have been sent to the board.\n(4)  If the pensioner is examined by an approved outside medical practitioner other than the health director, the reasonable and customary cost of the examination, if any, is payable from the assets of the fund.\n(c)  After a pensioner has undergone a medical examination, the health director shall provide the board with a report of the pensioner's present medical condition together with the doctor's opinion as to whether the pensioner continues to be disabled or whether the pensioner is no longer disabled to the extent that the pensioner could resume duties with the pensioner's former department.  The report and opinion may be divulged only to persons who have a legitimate need for them.\n(d)  If, in the opinion of the health director, the pensioner continues to be disabled, the board must continue payment of benefits.  If, in the opinion of the health director, the pensioner is no longer disabled, or is not so disabled that the pensioner could not perform some duties for the pensioner's former department, the board shall notify the department to determine if a position is available.  If a position is available, the board shall notify the pensioner to return to duty.  Disability benefits shall continue to be paid, however, until the pensioner returns to active service.  However, if the pensioner refuses to return to duty or is refused employment by either department for reasons other than disability, the board shall order disability payments stopped.  If a position is not available, the board must continue payments of the pensioner's disability pension.\n(e)  Pursuant to its authority under Section 6.06(o-2) of this article to review and modify any funding relating to the disability of a child who is a qualified survivor, the board may require the qualified survivor with a disability receiving death benefits to appear and undergo medical examination by the health director or, if the health director approves, by any licensed medical practitioner, to determine if the disability continues or if the disability has been removed.\nSec. 6.16.  WAIVER OF BENEFITS.  (a)  A primary party, qualified survivor, or beneficiary of a member's DROP account may, on a form prescribed by the board and filed with the executive director, waive all or a portion of the benefits to which the person is or may be entitled.  The waiver may state whether it is revocable or irrevocable, and is irrevocable unless the waiver clearly states it is revocable.\n(b)  The waiver described by Subsection (a) of this section applies only to benefits that become payable on or after the date the waiver is filed.\n(b-1)  Benefits waived by a revocable waiver are forfeited and the person making the waiver has no right, title, claim, or interest in the benefits.\n(c)  If two or more persons are or may be entitled to benefits under this article, the waiver described by Subsection (a) of this section must be executed by each person to become effective.  The living parent or parents or legal guardian or guardians of a child must sign the waiver described by Subsection (a) of this section on behalf of the child.\nSec. 6.17.  DENIAL OF BENEFITS: DEATH CAUSED BY SURVIVOR.  A qualified survivor or beneficiary of a member's DROP account is not eligible for, or entitled to, benefits if the person is the principal or an accomplice in wilfully bringing about the death of a primary party or another qualified survivor or beneficiary of a member's DROP account whose death would otherwise have resulted in a benefit or benefit increase to the person.  The determination of the board that a person wilfully brought about the death must be made during a meeting of the board from a preponderance of the evidence presented and is not controlled by any other finding in any other forum, whether considered under the same or another degree of proof.\nSec. 6.18.  INVESTIGATION.  (a)  The board shall consider all applications for retirement and disability pensions, all applications for death benefits, and all elections to participate in DROP.  The board shall give notice to persons applying for benefits, advising them of their right to appear before the board and offer such sworn evidence as they may desire.  Any person claiming retirement, disability, or DROP benefits may appear before the board and offer testimony that is relevant to a contested application for a retirement pension, a disability pension, death benefits, or DROP benefits.  The chairman of the board may issue process for witnesses, administer oaths to witnesses, and examine any witness as to any matter affecting benefits under any plan within the pension system.  Process for witnesses shall be served by any method of serving process permitted by the state law in any civil judicial proceeding.  A witness who fails or refuses to attend and testify may be compelled to attend and testify, as in any judicial proceeding.  The board may seek assistance from any court of competent jurisdiction to further compel or sanction a witness who fails or refuses to attend and testify.\n(b)  Any person who is aggrieved by a determination of the board regarding a retirement pension, a disability pension, death benefits, or DROP benefits may appeal the board determination to a state district court in the city where the pension system is located by giving written notice of appeal.  The notice shall contain a statement of the grounds and reasons why the party feels aggrieved.  The notice shall be served personally on the executive director within 20 days after the date of the board's determination.  After service of the notice, the party appealing shall file with the state district court a copy of the notice of intention to appeal, together with an affidavit of the party making service showing how, when, and on whom the notice was served.\n(c)  Within 30 days after the date of service of the notice of appeal on the board, the executive director shall make up and file with the state district court a transcript of all nonprivileged papers and proceedings in the case before the board.  When the copy of the notice of appeal and the transcript has been filed with the court, the appeal is perfected, and the court shall docket the appeal, assign the appeal a number, fix a date for hearing the appeal, and notify both the appellant and the board of the date fixed for the hearing.\n(d)  At any time before the rendering of its decision on appeal, the court may require further or additional proof or information, either documentary or under oath.  On rendition of a decision on appeal, the court shall give to each party to the appeal a copy of the decision of the case.  The decision of the court is appealable in the same manner as are civil cases generally.\n(e)  As provided by Section 4.01 of this article, the board shall approve all money used for investigations.  The board may request the investigative services of either the police or fire departments in connection with any matter arising under this section.\nSec. 6.19.  CERTIFICATE OF MEMBER PENSION BENEFIT ELIGIBILITY.  When a member has earned five years of pension service, the member shall be issued an incontestable five-year certificate indicating that the member is entitled to pension benefits subject to the effect of any withdrawals as permitted under Article 6243a or this article.  The certificate shall state that the calculation of the retirement pension to which the member is entitled, or any disability benefits to which the member may become entitled, shall be determined solely under the actual terms of the combined pension plan as in effect at the time the member leaves active service.  The certificate shall further state that in the case of the member's death, the member's qualified survivors, if any, may become entitled to death benefits as determined solely under the actual terms of the combined pension plan as in effect at the time of the member's death.  The certificate shall bear a seal and be signed by the executive director and chairman of the board.\nSec. 6.20.  ERRONEOUS PAYMENTS OR OVERPAYMENTS.  (a)  If the pension system pays money to any person not entitled to the payment, whether by reason of an error of the pension system as to entitlement to or the amount of a benefit or otherwise, or an act or error of some other person, including the recipient of the payment, the recipient of the payment holds the funds to which the recipient was not entitled in constructive trust for the pension system and those funds are subject to demand by the pension system at any time.\n(b)  The recipient of an erroneous payment from the pension system shall repay to the pension system all funds associated with the erroneous payment.\n(c)  Subject to Subsection (e) of this section, the board may by rule adopt a procedure to enable the pension system to offset the future benefit or other payments of a recipient described by this section.  In addition, the board may take any additional action, including the bringing of a lawsuit, the board considers necessary to recover an erroneous payment the pension system is entitled to under this section.\n(d)  If the pension system determines that a person is entitled to additional benefits as a result of an error made by the pension system, the pension system shall promptly pay the additional benefits owed.\n(e)  The board's correction procedures must comply with the Internal Revenue Service's Employee Plans Compliance Resolution System and Revenue Procedure 2016-51, including subsequent guidance.\nPART 6A.

ADJUDICATION OF CERTAIN CHALLENGES.  (a)  The Texas Supreme Court has exclusive and original jurisdiction over a challenge to the constitutionality under the Texas Constitution of Section 6A.01 of this article.  An action under this section is authorized to the full extent permitted by Section 3, Article V, Texas Constitution.  The Texas Supreme Court may issue any injunctive, declaratory, or equitable relief the court deems appropriate or necessary to effectuate the court's mandamus jurisdiction in connection with a challenge under this section.\n(b)  Any action brought under this section must be filed not later than the 90th day after the date the board adopts a rule under Section 6A.01 of this article.\n(c)  If an action brought under this section is timely filed, the board may not enforce or otherwise administer any rules adopted pursuant to Section 6A.01 of this article during the pendency of the action.\nPART 8. TREATMENT UNDER FEDERAL AND STATE LAW\nSec. 8.01.  QUALIFICATION UNDER FEDERAL TAX LAW.  (a)  The plans within the pension system and the assets of the fund are intended to qualify as a governmental plan under Sections 401 and 414(d) of the code, be exempt from federal income taxes under Section 501(a) of the code, and conform at all times to applicable requirements of law, regulations, and orders of duly constituted federal governmental authorities.  Accordingly, if any provision of this article is subject to more than one construction, one of which will permit the qualification of a plan that is within the pension system, that construction that will permit the plan to qualify and conform will prevail.\n(b)  The plans within the pension system as well as the assets of the fund shall be maintained for the exclusive benefit of members and their beneficiaries.  At no time before the termination of all the plans within the pension system and the satisfaction of all liabilities with respect to members and their beneficiaries under all plans shall any part of the principal or interest from the assets of the fund be used for or diverted to purposes other than the exclusive benefit of the members and beneficiaries.\n(c)  Notwithstanding any other provisions of this article, the annual benefit provided with respect to any member in any limitation year may not exceed the amount permitted by Section 415(b) of the code for the limitation year, and the sum of the member contributions and all other annual additions for any limitation year may not exceed the amount permitted under Section 415(c) of the code for the limitation year.  If the aggregated annual benefit or aggregated annual additions under any qualified plans created under this article and any other defined benefit plan or plans maintained by the city would otherwise exceed the limitations of Section 415 of the code, the required reductions in benefits or contributions shall first be made to the extent possible from the other plan or plans.  The limitations referenced in this subsection shall be adjusted annually in accordance with Section 415(d) of the code and any adjustment to benefits applies to the benefits of active and terminated members and applies without regard to whether a terminated member is a pensioner.\n(c-1)  Notwithstanding anything contained in this section to the contrary, the limitations, adjustments, and other requirements prescribed by this section shall at all times be computed in the manner most favorable to the affected members, to the extent permitted by guidelines issued by the Internal Revenue Service.  If any provision of Section 415 of the code is repealed or is not enforced by the Internal Revenue Service, that provision may not reduce the benefits of any member after the effective date of the repeal of the provision or during the period in which the provision is not enforced.\n(c-2)  Any benefit reductions that are required to be made under this section shall be applied to reduce the monthly benefit that would otherwise have been payable to the member, unless the value of the member's DROP account accrued under Section 6.14 of this article exceeds the amount that may be paid under this section.  If the value of the DROP account exceeds the value of the payments that may be made under this section, the member shall receive a lump-sum payment from the account of the maximum amount that may be paid under this section and the payment shall permanently reduce the benefits the member would otherwise have been entitled to receive under the combined pension plan.\n(d)  A member's retirement pension may not begin later than April 1 of the year after the later of the year in which the member leaves active service or the year in which the member attains age 70-1/2 and must at all times comply with the requirements of Section 401(a)(9) of the code.\n(e)  Any person who receives any distribution from any plan within the pension system that is an eligible rollover distribution as defined by Section 402(f)(2)(A) of the code is entitled to have that distribution transferred directly to another eligible retirement plan as defined by Section 402(c)(8)(B) of the code of the person's choice on providing direction regarding that transfer to the executive director in accordance with procedures established by the executive director.\n(e-1)  If an eligible rollover distribution described by Subsection (e) of this section is to a designated beneficiary who is not the spouse or former spouse of the member, the transfer may only be to an individual retirement account or an individual retirement annuity.\n(f)  For the 2017 calendar year, the annual compensation taken into account for any purpose under the combined pension plan may not exceed $400,000 for an eligible participant or $270,000 for an ineligible participant.  For a Group A member the term \"annual compensation\" means the aggregate of the member's base pay.  For a Group B member the term \"annual compensation\" means the aggregate of the member's computation pay for any given plan year.  These dollar limits shall be adjusted from time to time in accordance with guidelines provided by the secretary of the treasury.  For purposes of this subsection, an:\n(1)  \"eligible participant\" means any person who first became a member of the pension system before January 1, 1996; and\n(2)  \"ineligible participant\" means any member who is not an eligible participant.\n(g)  For purposes of Subsection (h) of this section, \"normal retirement age\" means the earlier of:\n(1)  the attainment of 50 years of age on or before September 1, 2017, and completion of at least five years of pension service;\n(2)  the attainment of 58 years of age after September 1, 2017, and completion of at least five years of pension service; or\n(3)  completion of 20 years of pension service.\n(h)  The retirement benefit earned by a member is nonforfeitable:\n(1)  on attainment of normal retirement age, if not already nonforfeitable; or\n(2)  to the extent the benefit is funded, if not already nonforfeitable, on the termination or partial termination of the combined pension plan or the complete discontinuance of city contributions to the fund.\n(i)  In accordance with Section 401(a)(8) of the code, forfeitures arising under the combined pension plan may not be used to increase the benefits any member would otherwise receive under the terms of the plan.  Forfeitures may be used first to reduce administrative expenses, then to reduce required city contributions.\n(j)  Subject to procedures adopted by the board, the pension system shall accept an eligible rollover distribution from another eligible retirement plan as defined by Section 402(f)(2)(B) of the code as payment of all or a portion of any payment a member is permitted to make to the pension system for past pension service credit.  The pension system shall separately account for any after-tax contributions transferred from any plan under this subsection.\nSec. 8.02.  EXCESS BENEFIT PLAN FOR POLICE OFFICERS AND FIRE FIGHTERS.  The board may by rule establish and administer a separate qualified governmental excess benefit arrangement and associated trust for the arrangement in accordance with Section 415(m) of the code.\nSec. 8.03.  EXEMPTION OF BENEFITS FROM JUDICIAL PROCESS OR ALIENATION.  (a)  A portion of the fund or benefit or amount awarded to any primary party, qualified survivor, beneficiary of a member's DROP account, excess benefit participant, or survivor of an excess benefit participant under this article may not be held, seized, taken, subjected to, or detained or levied on by virtue of any execution, attachment, garnishment, injunction, or other writ, order, or decree, or any process or proceedings issued from or by any court for the payment or satisfaction, in whole or in part, of any debt, damage, claim, demands, or judgment against any person entitled to benefits from any plan within the pension system or from the excess benefit plan.  The fund and the excess benefit plan or any claim against the fund or the excess benefit plan may not be directly or indirectly assigned or transferred, and any attempt to transfer or assign the fund or the excess benefit plan or a claim against the fund or the excess benefit plan is void.\n(b)  A benefit under any plan created or existing pursuant to this article or Article 6243a is subject to division pursuant to the terms of a qualified domestic relations order.  The executive director shall determine the qualifications of a domestic relations order according to a uniform, consistent procedure approved by the board.  The total benefit payable to a primary party or to an alternate payee under a qualified domestic relations order may not actuarially exceed the benefits to which a primary party would be entitled in the absence of the qualified domestic relations order.  In calculating the alternate payee's benefits under a qualified domestic relations order, the interest rate is the rate used by the pension system's actuary in the actuarial evaluation for that year, except that the minimum interest rate for this purpose is the minimum required by Section 414 of the code.\n(c)  This section does not preclude:\n(1)  the payment of death benefits to a trust for certain children of a primary party pursuant to Section 6.06(n) of this article;\n(2)  the withholding of federal taxes from pension benefits;\n(3)  the recovery by the board of overpayments of benefits previously made to any person;\n(4)  the direct deposit of benefit payments to an account in a bank, savings and loan association, credit union, or other financial institution, provided the arrangement is not an alienation;\n(5)  under any policy adopted by the board and uniformly applied to voluntary arrangements entered into by a primary party or qualified survivor, any voluntary and revocable arrangement entered into by a pensioner or a qualified survivor that permits the withholding and direct payment of health care or life insurance premiums or similar payments from the monthly benefit payments; or\n(6)  an assignment of the distribution from an annuitized DROP account to a third party under Section 6.14(e-3)(1) of this article.\n(d)  For purposes of Subsection (c) of this section, an attachment, garnishment, levy, execution, or other legal process is not considered a voluntary arrangement.\nAdded by Acts 1989, 71st Leg., ch. 553, Sec. 1, eff.

In no case shall the amount paid to any one family exceed monthly the amount of one-half of the monthly salary earned by the deceased immediately prior to the time of his retirement, or, if not retired, prior to the time of his death.  On the remarriage of any widow, such pension paid to her for her benefit shall cease and in the event that there are child or  children under sixteen (16) years of age at the time of said remarriage, one-third of the monthly salary received by such member immediately preceding his retirement, and if not retired before death, immediately preceding his death, shall be paid monthly to the widow for the sole benefit of the child or children under the age of sixteen (16) years;  provided, however, that the Pension Board, if it finds that said payments to the widow are not being used for the benefit of said child or children, may order said monthly benefits paid to said child or children instead of to said widow who has remarried.  Where there is more than one child of such contributor, the benefits herein provided for shall be equally divided among the children, and upon the marriage or death of any child receiving such pension, or upon any child receiving such pension reaching sixteen (16) years of age, such pension payment for the benefit of said child shall cease, and if there remains a child or children under sixteen (16) years of age, the share of the said child so married or dead or reaching sixteen (16) years of age, shall be paid for the benefit of the remaining child or children under sixteen (16) years of age.  In the event that a contributor leaves a widow and child or children under sixteen (16) years of age who are not the children of said widow, the Pension Board may, in its discretion, either pay monthly to the widow for the benefit of herself and said child or children, an amount not exceeding one-half of the monthly salary received by such member immediately preceding his retirement, or immediately preceding his death, if not retired before death, as hereinabove provided, or said Board may order one-fourth of said monthly salary received by such member paid to the widow and one-fourth of said monthly salary paid to said child or children.  No widow or child of any such member resulting from any marriage contracted subsequent to the date of retirement of said member shall be entitled to a pension under this law;  provided, however, that the provisions of this Section shall not be construed so as to change any pension now being paid any pensioner under the provisions of this Act.  The provisions of this section are subject to change under the provisions of Section 10A of this Act.\nSec. 10. DEATH BENEFITS, FATHER, ETC.  If any member of the fire department or police department dies from injuries received or disease contracted while in the line of duty, or from any cause through no fault of his own, who was a contributor to said fund and entitled to participate in said fund himself, leaves no wife or child, but who shall leave surviving him a dependent father, mother, brother, or sister, wholly dependent upon said person for support, such dependent father, mother, sister and brother shall be entitled to receive in the aggregate one-half of the salary earned by said deceased immediately prior to his death, to be equally divided between those who are wholly dependent on said deceased, so long as they are wholly dependent.  The board shall have authority to determine the facts as to the dependency of said parties and each of them, as to how long the same exists, and may at any time upon the request of any contributor to such fund, reopen any award made to any of said parties and discontinue such pension as to all or any of them as it may deem proper, and the findings of said board in regard to such matter and as to all pensions granted under this law shall be final upon all parties seeking a pension as a dependent of said deceased, or otherwise, until such award of the trustees shall have been set aside or revoked.  The provisions of this section are subject to change under the provisions of Section 10A of this Act.\nSec. 10A.  MODIFICATION OF BENEFITS, MEMBERSHIP QUALIFICATIONS, ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS AND CONTRIBUTIONS;  CONDITIONS.  (a)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in other parts of this Act and subject to Subsections (b) and (c) of this section, the Board of Trustees may, by majority vote of the whole board, make from time to time one or more of the following changes, or modifications:\n(1)  modify or change prospectively or retroactively in any manner whatsoever any of the benefits provided by this Act, except that any retroactive change or modification shall only increase pensions or benefits;\n(2)  modify or change prospectively in any manner whatsoever any of the membership qualifications;\n(3)  modify or change prospectively or retroactively in any manner whatsoever any of the eligibility requirements for pensions or benefits;\n(4)  increase or decrease prospectively the percentage of wages less than the one per cent (1%) minimum or above the six per cent (6%) maximum provided in Section 2 of this Act to be contributed to the fund;  or\n(5)  provide prospectively for refunds, in whole or in part, and with or without interest, of contributions made to the fund by employees who leave the city service before qualifying for a pension.\n(b)  None of the changes made under Subsection (a) of this section may be made unless all of the following conditions are sequentially complied with:\n(1)  the change must be approved by a qualified actuary selected by a four-fifths vote of the Board;  the actuary's approval must be based on an actuarial finding that the change is supported by the existing funding status of the fund; the actuary, if an individual, must be a Fellow of the Society of Actuaries or a Fellow of the Conference of Actuaries in Public Practice or a Member of the American Academy of Actuaries;  the actuary, if an actuarial consulting firm, must be established in the business of providing actuarial consulting services to pension plans and have experienced personnel able to provide the requested services; the findings upon which the properly selected and qualified actuary's approval are based are not subject to judicial review;\n(2)  the change must be approved by a majority of all persons then making contributions to the fund as employees of a department to which the change would directly apply, voting by secret ballot at an election held after ten (10) days' notice given by posting at a prominent place in every station or substation of a department to which the change would directly apply and in the city hall;\n(3)  the changes, except changes made under the provisions of Subdivision (1), Subsection (a), of this section, shall apply only to active member employees who are members of the affected departments at the time the change becomes effective and those who enter the departments thereafter;  and\n(4)  the changes shall not deprive any person, without his written consent, of any right to receive a pension or benefits which have already become vested and matured.\n(c)  If the Board of Trustees proposes to change benefits under Subdivision (1), Subsection (a), of this section, the change is not effective until the change is finally approved in accordance with this subsection.  The Board shall submit the change for approval by the city's or town's governing body. If disapproved by the governing body, or if the governing body fails to act within sixty (60) days of presentation to the governing body, the Board, by resolution passed by a majority of the whole Board, plus one, may require the city's or town's governing body to hold an election, as soon as practicable, for approval of the change by the qualified voters of the city or town.  Any change proposed and subsequently approved by the voters under this subsection becomes effective as of the beginning of the city's or town's next fiscal year.\nSec. 11. INVESTIGATIONS.

AWARDS EXEMPT.  No amount awarded to any person under the provisions of this law shall be liable for the debts of any such person;  shall not be assignable and shall be exempt from garnishment or other legal process.\nSec. 16.

After a separation has been voted and approved, as above provided, the Board of Trustees shall apportion the existing Firemen and Policemen Pension Fund between the two (2) Funds on the basis of contributions made by the members of the respective Departments and donations or payments to said Departments, and thereafter all payments to members or their beneficiaries of benefits, now accrued or hereafter accruing, shall be made from the Fund of their Department.  Where a separation of funds is had, as hereinabove provided, the governing body of any city or town whose voters have authorized the payment of funds from the public treasury into the Firemen and Policemen Pension Fund is hereby authorized to pay to the Board of Trustees, for the use of the Pension Fund of each division above provided for, sums not to exceed in total the amount voted by the people to be paid into the single fund.\nSec. 17.

OPERATION OF FUND NOTWITHSTANDING CENSUS CHANGE.  Any city which has heretofore established a firemen and policemen fund in accordance with Article 6243B of Vernon's Texas Civil Statutes or as amended, shall continue to operate such fund under the provisions of this Act.

There is hereby created in all incorporated cities in this State having a population of two hundred and ninety thousand (290,000), or more, according to the preceding Federal Census, a fund to be known as the policemen's relief and retirement fund.  Said fund shall be administered in each such city by a board to be known as the policemen's relief and retirement board.\nThe expression \"pension fund,\" as used herein, shall mean the policemen's relief and retirement fund.  The expression \"pension board,\" as used in this Act, means the policemen's relief and retirement board of each such city.  All members of the police department of any such city shall participate in said pension fund, and shall be subject to all of the provisions of this Act, save and except special officers, part-time officers, janitors, car washers, and cooks.  With the exceptions just named, it is the intention hereof to include everyone who is designated by any such city as a member of said police department, regardless of the particular duty or duties performed by such person.  The expressions \"member\" and \"members,\" as used in this Act, mean members of any such police department who are entitled to participate in said pension fund as above set forth, that is, the entire personnel of any such police department, save and except special officers, part-time officers, janitors, car washers, and cooks, in each city.\nSec. 2. PENSION BOARD.  Said pension board in each such city shall consist of one person to be appointed by the mayor and confirmed by the city council or governing body of such city, the city controller, or, if there be no city controller, then the person discharging the duties of the city controller in such city, and three (3) persons to be elected from the police department by the members.  As soon as practicable after the effective date of this Act, said members of each such police department shall elect said three (3) members of said pension board, one to be elected until the next succeeding January 1st thereafter, and two (2) to be elected until the second January 1st following such election, and thereafter, as the terms expire, new members to said pension board shall be similarly elected to hold office until the second January 1st following their respective elections.  In case of vacancies, new members shall be elected to serve the unexpired term.  All persons elected to said pension board shall hold office until their successors are elected and qualified.  Any member shall be eligible to election to said pension board.\nSaid pension board shall annually elect a chairman, vice-chairman, and a secretary, from the members of said pension board.  Each one so elected, shall serve until his successor is elected.\nA meeting of said pension board may be called at any time by the chairman, secretary, or by any two (2) members of such pension board.  Three (3) members of said pension board shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business.\nEach member of said pension board shall take an oath that he will well and faithfully perform the duties of a member of such pension board.\nNo moneys shall be paid out of the pension fund except upon an order by said pension board, duly entered in the minutes.\nSec. 3. TREASURER OF PENSION FUND.  The city treasurer of any such city, or the person discharging the duties of the city treasurer, is hereby designated as the treasurer of the said pension fund for said city, and his official bond to said city shall operate to cover his position of treasurer of said pension fund.  All moneys of every kind and character collected or to be collected for said fund, shall be paid over to said treasurer, and shall be administered and paid out only in accordance with the provisions of this Act.\nSec. 4. PER CAPITA CONTRIBUTIONS.  Commencing with the next calendar month, immediately following the effective date of this Act, per capita contributions of all such members of each such police department as participate in such fund, as aforesaid, shall be made to said fund.  Said monthly per capita contribution shall be made as follows:  The salary and future salary of each member participating in such fund is hereby reduced Three Dollars ($3) per month, but said Three Dollars ($3) per month shall be paid by such city into the said pension fund.  No other money paid into said pension fund, however, shall be counted as a part of salary, under any law or ordinance fixing or pertaining to salaries of members, of any such police department.\nSec. 5. ACCUMULATED FUNDS.  In all such cities where a general pension fund for city employees has been accumulated but has not been put into operation at the effective date of this Act, the governing body of each such city shall segregate from said fund, the proportion which the total number of members of the police department (eligible to said pension fund) bears to the entire number of all city employees, for whose benefit said fund was accumulated, and shall set aside such sum into the policemen's relief and retirement fund.\nSec. 6. ASSIGNMENTS OF SALARY TO FUND.  Any members who have or may have any back or past due salary due them, from any such city, may assign all or any portion of such back salary to said pension fund, and such assignments as have or may hereafter be executed by any such members, are hereby validated and shall be recognized by the governing body of any such city, and such sums, if any, shall be paid into the said pension fund.\nSec. 7. APPROPRIATIONS TO FUND OUT OF GENERAL FUNDS OF CITY.  Any such city may make additional appropriations from time to time out of its general fund, or otherwise, into the said pension fund, and hereafter when any such city shall make any appropriations for pensions of city employees or place any money into any such account, the proportionate amount thereof shall be placed in the policemen's relief and retirement fund.  Said pension fund may also be augmented as follows:  By the giving of entertainments and benefit performances;  by gifts or donations from any person, firm, or corporation;  all rewards hereafter paid to or due individual members for, or on account of service rendered by them as members of the police department, shall be paid into such fund;  and said pension fund shall also participate in funds otherwise provided or that shall hereafter be provided by law pertaining to police pensions of cities of the class herein provided for.\nSec. 8. INVESTMENT OF SURPLUS FUNDS.  Whenever, in the opinion of the said pension board, there is on hand in said pension fund, a surplus over and above a reasonably safe amount to take care of current demands upon such funds, such surplus, or so much thereof as in the judgment of the said pension board is deemed proper, may be invested in securities of the United States, the State of Texas, or of counties, school districts, or municipal corporations.  No investment shall be made, however, which does not meet with the approval of the city controller, if any, of such city.\nSec. 9. BENEFITS TO BEGIN NOT PRIOR TO JANUARY 1, 1942.  No benefits of any kind shall be paid out of said fund prior to January 1, 1942.\nSec. 10. PENSION RATES.  From and after January 1, 1942, any member who shall have been a member of such police department for the period of twenty-five (25) years, and who shall have reached the age of fifty (50) years, shall be entitled to a retirement pension of Seventy-five Dollars ($75) per month for the rest of his life upon his retirement from said police department.  Upon the completion of the said twenty-five (25) years of service, such pension board shall issue to him a certificate showing that he is entitled to said retirement pension, and thereafter, when such member retires from the police department, whether such retirement be voluntary or involuntary, such monthly payments shall forthwith begin, and continue for the remainder of said member's life.  Provided, however, that payments shall not commence until such member is fifty (50) years of age, and further provided that members who are eligible for a pension but who continue in the department shall make their per capita contributions until they retire from the department.\nIn computing the twenty-five (25) years service required for retirement pension, interruption of less than one year out of service, shall be construed as continuous service and such period out of service shall not be deducted from the twenty-five (25) years, but if out for more than one year and less than five (5) years, credit shall be given for prior service, but deduction made for the length of time out of service.  If out of service more than five (5) years, no previous service prior to said time shall be counted.\nService with any such city in some other department, prior to January 1, 1939, shall be included in the twenty-five (25) years above provided for, but service after January 1, 1939, must be in the police department.  The pension board may, within its discretion, provide for the payment of such retirement pension to a former member or members of the police department who have heretofore served for the twenty-five-year period and who have reached the age of fifty (50) years, and it is the intention hereof to include in the group of former members those who have heretofore been retired by any such city and who are drawing partial pay or compensation from such city.\nSec. 11. DISABILITY RESULTING FROM PERFORMANCE OF DUTY.  If any member shall become totally or permanently disabled as a direct and proximate result of the performance of duties in the police department, said member shall be retired on a pension of Seventy-five Dollars ($75) per month.\nBy total and permanent disability is meant such disability as permanently incapacitates a member from performing the usual and customary duties of a police officer.\nBefore any retirement on disability pension is made, the pension board shall require such medical examination and such other evidence as it may see fit to establish such total and permanent disability, as above provided.\nWhen any member has been retired for total and permanent disability, he shall be subject at all times to re-examination by the pension board and shall submit himself to such further examination as the pension board may require.  If any member shall refuse to submit himself to any such examination, the pension board may within its discretion, order said payment stopped.  If a member who has been retired under the provision of this Section, should thereafter recover so that in the opinion of the pension board, he is able to perform the usual and customary duties of a police officer, and such member is reinstated or tendered reinstatement in the police department, then the pension board shall order such payments stopped.\nSaid pension board may, at its discretion, retire on said permanent and total disability pension, those members of said police department who have heretofore become totally and permanently disabled, as that term is above defined.\nSec. 12. DEATH RESULTING FROM PERFORMANCE OF DUTY.  Should any such member die, as a direct and proximate result of injuries received or sickness incurred in line of duty in said police department, the pension board shall order paid to the beneficiaries hereinafter designated, the sum of Seventy-five Dollars ($75) per month for a period of ten (10) years.  Such beneficiaries shall be as follows:  The surviving wife, surviving children under the age of sixteen (16) years, and the dependent parent or parents, if any.  If there be neither surviving wife, children under the age of sixteen (16) years, nor dependent parents, then no payments shall be made on account of the death of any such member.  If there be a surviving wife, but no children under the age of sixteen (16) years, then the entire payment of Seventy-five Dollars ($75) per month shall be made to such surviving wife.  If there be a surviving wife and children under the age of sixteen (16) years, then the payments shall be Thirty-seven Dollars and Fifty Cents ($37.50) per month to the wife and Thirty-seven Dollars and Fifty Cents ($37.50) per month payable to the legal guardian of such children, to be administered in accordance with the orders of the Probate Court.  As each child becomes sixteen (16) years of age, the children's part of Thirty-seven Dollars and Fifty Cents ($37.50) per month shall thereafter be for the use and benefit of the children who then remain under the age of sixteen (16) years.  When there are no longer any children under the age of sixteen (16) years, the entire amount of Seventy-five Dollars ($75) per month shall be paid the surviving wife.  When there is no surviving wife, but there are surviving children under the age of sixteen (16) years, the entire Seventy-five Dollars ($75) per month shall be paid to the legal guardian of such children under the age of sixteen (16) years, but such payment shall not be made for or on account of any child after said child reaches the age of sixteen (16) years.  Should such surviving wife thereafter die, then the entire Seventy-five Dollars ($75) shall likewise be paid for the benefit of such children as remain under the age of sixteen (16) years.  If there be neither a surviving wife nor surviving children under the age of sixteen (16), then such payments shall be made to the dependent parent, or parents, if any, of such deceased member.  If there be two (2) dependent parents, then the Seventy-five Dollars ($75) per month shall be divided equally between them, but if there be only one dependent parent, the Seventy-five Dollars ($75) per month shall be paid to said parent.\nThe term \"dependent parent\" means a parent who is principally dependent upon said member for a livelihood.\nBy the term \"surviving wife\" is meant the woman, if any, who is the lawful wife of said member at the time of his death.\nNo death benefits whatever shall be paid after the expiration of ten (10) years from the death of any said member, and no beneficiary shall ever receive more than Seventy-five Dollars ($75) per month.\nIn the event of women members of the department, their surviving husbands shall be entitled to the same rights and benefits as have the wives of the male members.\nSec. 13. PENSION TO DEPENDENTS, WHEN.  When any member who has been retired upon pension, whether retirement pension or disability pension, or when any member who has a pension certificate shall thereafter die from any cause, his pension of Seventy-five Dollars ($75) per month shall be payable to his dependents, if any, as is provided in the next preceding Section hereof, but only for the unexpired portion of ten (10) years.  In computing said ten (10) years, such length of time as a pension may have been paid to said member during his lifetime shall be deducted from such ten-year period, and such dependents shall receive said payment only for the unexpired term of ten (10) years.\nSec. 14. REFUNDS ON LEAVING SERVICE.  If any such member shall leave such police department either voluntarily or involuntarily before he is entitled to a pension, he shall have refunded to him the deductions from his salary, which have been paid into said pension fund.  Said payments may be made to him, either in a lump sum or on a monthly basis, as may be determined by the pension board.\nProvided, however, that this Section shall be subject to Section 10 and upon a re-entry into the department all such refunds shall be paid back into the pension fund or prior service of such member shall not be counted toward his retirement pension.\nSec. 15. REDUCTION OF BENEFITS AUTHORIZED IN CASE FUND IS DEPLETED.  In the event said pension fund becomes seriously depleted, in the opinion of the pension board, said pension board may proportionately and temporarily reduce the benefits of all pensioners and beneficiaries, but such reductions shall thereafter be paid to such pensioners or beneficiaries as and when said fund is, in the opinion of the pension board, sufficiently re-established to do so.\nSec. 16.

NORMAL SERVICE RETIREMENT BENEFIT.    (a)  The service retirement annuity of a person who retires under Section 5.01 of this Act on or after January 1, 1995, is a monthly payment that is equal to three percent of the member's average monthly compensation multiplied by the member's number of years of service credit and any fraction of a year of service credit.\n(b)  The three percent factor used in this section may be changed to some other percent if the change:\n(1)  is first approved by the board's actuary;\n(2)  is approved by the board of trustees;\n(3)  applies to one or any combination of the following groups:\n(A)  firefighters who are employed on an active, full-time basis in the fire department at the time of the change;\n(B)  firefighters who begin service with the fire department after the change becomes effective;  and\n(C)  members who retire under Section 5.06 of this Act after the change becomes effective; and\n(4)  does not reduce a member's benefit for service credit accumulated before the date of the change.\n(b-1)  In determining whether to approve an increase in the factor under Subsection (b) of this section, the board's actuary shall take into consideration whether the fund has reserves sufficient to enable the payment of a cost-of-living adjustment under Section 9.04(a) of this Act to all current members and survivors at a level that is equal to the average percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers as determined by the United States Department of Labor for the 10 annual periods preceding the proposed effective date of the change.\n(c) The service retirement annuity of a person who retired before January 1, 1995, is a monthly payment based on the benefit formula in effect at the time of the person's retirement, together with any increases for retirees approved by the board of trustees after the person's retirement.\nSec. 5.05.

ELIGIBILITY AFTER 10 YEARS OF SERVICE.    (a)  A member may terminate employment with the fire department and later retire and receive a service retirement benefit if, at the time of the member's retirement:\n(1) the member has accumulated at least 10 years of service credit in the fund and made required contributions to the fund for at least 10 years;\n(2) the member does not withdraw the member's contributions from the fund at the time of or after the termination of employment;  and\n(3) the member has either attained 50 years of age or would have accumulated at least 25 years of service credit if the member had not terminated employment with the fire department.\n(b) The retirement benefit payable to a member on retirement under this section is the service retirement benefit described by Section 5.04 of this Act, computed on the basis of the formula in effect at the time of the member's retirement under this Act.\nSec. 5.07. WITHDRAWAL OF CONTRIBUTIONS.  A person who has terminated employment with the fire department and left the person's contributions with the fund under Section 5.06 of this Act may at any time apply for and receive the person's accumulated contributions under Section 9.06 of this Act, with the effect provided by that section.  If a person eligible for a refund of contributions elects to have all or a portion of the accumulated contributions paid directly to an eligible retirement plan and specifies the eligible retirement plan to which the contributions are to be paid on a form approved for that purpose by the fund, the fund shall make the payment in the form of a direct trustee-to-trustee transfer but is under no obligation to determine whether the other plan in fact is an eligible retirement plan for that purpose.\nARTICLE 6.

TERMINATION DURING FIRST 2-1/2 YEARS.  If, during the first 2-1/2 years of disability retirement, a retiree recovers to the extent that the person is able to perform the duties of the person's job as a firefighter, the board of trustees may terminate the retirement benefit and restore the person to active service at not less than the same rank the person held at the time of disability retirement.\nSec. 6.05. CONTINUATION AFTER FIRST 2-1/2 YEARS.  After a retiree has received disability retirement benefits from the fund for at least 2-1/2 years, the board of trustees from time to time may review the situation of the person to determine the status of the disability.  The board of trustees may ask the medical board for its opinion of the status of the disability.  If the board of trustees determines that the person has recovered to the extent that the person is able to be employed, the board of trustees may:\n(1) continue to pay the full disability retirement benefit;\n(2) pay a reduced disability retirement benefit in an amount commensurate with the person's disability as determined by the board;  or\n(3) discontinue payment of a disability benefit.\nSec. 6.06. APPLICATION;  PHYSICIAN'S STATEMENT;  MEDICAL BOARD ACTION.

The fund shall pay any costs or fees of examination by a person other than the member's own physician.\n(c) A certificate from the medical board may include a finding by that board that the disability is likely to be temporary or is likely to be total and permanent.\n(d) The board of trustees at any time may require a person receiving a disability retirement benefit under this Act to appear and undergo a medical examination by a physician selected by the board of trustees or the medical board for that purpose.  The result of the examination and report by that physician shall be considered by the board of trustees in determining whether the disability retirement benefit will be continued, increased, if less than the maximum provided by this Act, decreased, or discontinued.\nSec. 6.07. EVIDENCE OF INCOME OF DISABILITY RETIREE.  The board of trustees may require a person receiving disability retirement benefits under this Act to provide evidence of annual income.

REINSTATEMENT;  SERVICE RETIREMENT ELIGIBILITY.    (a)  The board of trustees may reinstate any disability retirement benefit that previously has been terminated or reduced if the disabled firefighter's condition has worsened as a result of the same cause for which the person was previously granted disability retirement.\n(b) If a person's disability retirement benefit is reduced or discontinued and the person is or subsequently becomes eligible for service retirement under other provisions of this Act, the person is entitled to the service retirement benefit on meeting all requirements for that benefit, reduced by the amount of any disability retirement benefit that the person continues to receive from the fund.\nSec. 6.09.

SURVIVING SPOUSE OF RETIREE.  (a)  On the death of a retiree, the retiree's surviving spouse is entitled to receive an immediate monthly benefit from the fund of 75 percent of the retirement benefit that was being paid to the retiree if the spouse:\n(1)  was married to the retiree at the time of the retiree's retirement;  or\n(2)  married the retiree after the retiree's retirement and was married to the retiree for at least 24 consecutive months.\n(b)  For purposes of Subsection (a)(1) of this section, with respect to an informal marriage established in this state, a surviving spouse is considered married to a retiree as of the date a declaration of informal marriage was recorded in accordance with Subchapter E, Chapter 2, Family Code.\nSec. 7.03.

If no person would be entitled to the benefit, the benefit is payable to the decedent's estate.\n(b) The fund is not required to pay a benefit under Subsection (a) of this section unless it receives actual notice of the conviction of the person who would have been entitled to the benefits.  However, the fund may delay payment of a benefit payable on the death of a member pending the results of a criminal investigation and of legal proceedings relating to the cause of death.\n(c) The benefit payable under Subsection (a) of this section is a refund of the member's accumulated contributions and interest, reduced by any annuity payments that may have been made as a result of the member's retirement.\n(d) For the purposes of this section, a person has been convicted of causing the death of a member or beneficiary if the person:\n(1) has pleaded guilty or nolo contendere to or has been found guilty by a court of an offense at the trial of which it is established that the person's intentional, knowing, or reckless act or omission resulted in the death of the person who was the member or beneficiary, regardless of whether sentence is imposed or probated;  and\n(2) has no appeal of the conviction pending and the time provided for appeal has expired.\nSec. 7.09.

DEFERRED RETIREMENT OPTION PLAN\nSec. 8.01. MEMBER REMAINING IN ACTIVE SERVICE.  In lieu of either leaving active service and beginning to receive a service retirement annuity under Section 5.01 of this Act or remaining in active service and continuing to accrue additional service credit under Section 5.02 of this Act, a member who is eligible to receive a normal service retirement benefit under Section 5.01 of this Act may remain in active service, become a participant in the deferred retirement option plan (\"DROP\") in accordance with Sections 8.02 and 8.03 of this Act, and defer the beginning of the person's retirement annuity.  Once an election to participate in the DROP has been made, the election continues in effect as long as the member remains in active service as a firefighter.  When the member leaves active service, the member may apply for a service retirement annuity under Section 5.01 of this Act.\nSec. 8.02. ELECTION TO PARTICIPATE IN DROP.  The election to participate in the DROP shall be made in accordance with procedures adopted by the board of trustees.  The election may be made at any time on or after the date the member becomes eligible for normal service retirement under Section 5.01 of this Act or early retirement under Section 5.05 of this Act and becomes effective on the first day of the first month after the date of the election.  At the same time that a member makes an election to participate in the DROP, the member must agree in writing to terminate service with the fire department on a date not later than the seventh anniversary of the effective date of the election under this section.  An agreement to terminate service is binding on the member and the fire department, except that the member may terminate active service at any time before the date selected.  An election to participate in the DROP has no effect on either the municipality's or the member's contributions under Section 10.01 of this Act.\nSec. 8.03. CREDITS TO MEMBER'S DROP ACCOUNT.  Each month after a member makes an election to participate in the DROP and until the member's retirement, the board of trustees shall cause an amount equal to the retirement annuity that the member would have received under Section 5.04 of this Act for that month if the member had left active service and been granted a retirement annuity on the effective date of the election under Section 8.02 of this Act to be credited to a separate DROP account maintained within the fund for the benefit of the member.  The member's contributions under Section 10.01(d) of this Act made after the effective date of the election to participate in the DROP shall also be credited to the member's DROP account.  Amounts held in a member's DROP account shall be credited at the end of each calendar month with interest at a rate equal to one-twelfth of five percent until the member's retirement.\nSec. 8.04. AMOUNT OF CREDITS TO MEMBER'S DROP ACCOUNT.  The amount credited monthly to the member's DROP account:\n(1) shall be increased as a result of any increase in the formula used in computing service retirement benefits under Section 5.04 of this Act that occurs after the effective date of the member's election to participate in the DROP but before the effective date of the member's retirement;\n(2) shall be increased by any annual cost-of-living adjustments under Section 9.04 of this Act that occur between the effective date of the member's election to participate in the DROP and the effective date of the member's retirement but only as to amounts credited to the member's DROP account after a cost-of-living adjustment;  and\n(3) is subject to the limitations prescribed by Section 9.03 of this Act.\nSec. 8.05.

(a)  On leaving active service as a firefighter and beginning to receive a retirement annuity, a member who participates in the DROP shall begin to receive the amount credited to the person's DROP account under either of the following methods of distribution selected by the member:\n(1) a single-payment distribution made at a time selected by the member but not later than April 1 of the year after the member attains 70-1/2 years of age;  or\n(2) in not more than four payments, which may be equal or unequal as the member may determine, all of which must occur not later than April 1 of the year after the member attains 70-1/2 years of age.\n(b) The DROP account balance of a member shall be credited at the end of each calendar month with interest at a rate equal to one-twelfth of five percent.\n(c) A member may not receive a distribution from the member's DROP account before termination of active service as a firefighter.  A member shall notify the fund in writing, on a form that the board of trustees may prescribe, at least 30 days before each distribution made under this section.\n(d)  The board of trustees may adopt rules that modify the availability of distributions under Subsection (a) of this section, provided that the modifications do not:\n(1)  impair the distribution rights under that subsection; or\n(2)  cause distributions to occur later than required under Section 401(a)(9), Internal Revenue Code of 1986.\nSec. 8.06. ESTABLISHMENT OF DROP ACCOUNT AT RETIREMENT.    (a)  In lieu of electing to participate in the DROP before actual retirement, a member who is eligible for normal service retirement or early retirement and who terminates or has terminated active service as a firefighter may establish a DROP account under this section.\n(b) A member who is eligible to receive a service retirement benefit under Section 5.06 of this Act may establish a DROP account under this section on retiring under Section 5.06 of this Act.\n(c) If a member elects to participate in the DROP under this section:\n(1) the board of trustees shall cause to be credited to a DROP account maintained within the fund for the benefit of that person an amount equal to the credits that the member's DROP account would have received, including interest, if the member had established the DROP account after becoming eligible for service retirement, but not more than seven years before the effective date of the person's retirement;\n(2) the date used in computations under Subdivision (1) of this section as if the member had established the DROP account on that date is the effective date of the member's election to participate in the DROP;\n(3) the member will receive payments from the member's DROP account as the member may select under Section 8.05 of this Act;  and\n(4) the member's DROP account shall be credited with interest as provided by Section 8.05 of this Act.\n(d) If a member who did not establish a DROP account under this section but was eligible to do so dies before retirement, the surviving spouse, if any, of that member may elect to participate in the DROP if the surviving spouse has not received any benefit payments under Section 7.01 of this Act.  If a surviving spouse makes an election under this subsection:\n(1) the board of trustees shall cause to be paid to the surviving spouse in a lump sum, as soon as administratively possible after the fund receives notice of the election, an amount equal to the credits that the member's DROP account would have received, including interest, if the member had established the DROP account after becoming eligible for service retirement, but not more than seven years before the date of the member's death;  and\n(2) the amount of the benefit payable to the surviving spouse under Section 7.03 of this Act is 75 percent of the benefit the member would have been eligible to receive if the member had established the DROP account on becoming eligible for service retirement, but not more than seven years before the date of the member's death.\n(e) If a member who did not establish a DROP account under this section but was eligible to do so dies before retirement without leaving a surviving spouse, the surviving dependent children, if any, may elect to participate in the DROP if the dependent children have not received any benefit payments under Section 7.05 of this Act.  An election under this subsection must be made by all of the surviving dependent children of the member, except that the guardian of any child who is younger than 18 years of age at the time of the election makes a binding election for the child.  If the surviving dependent children make an election under this subsection:\n(1) the board of trustees shall cause to be paid jointly to the dependent children in a lump sum, as soon as administratively possible after the fund receives notice of the election, an amount equal to the credits the member's DROP account would have received, including interest, if the member had established the DROP account after becoming eligible for service retirement, but not less than the credits the DROP account would have received, including interest, based on 20 years of service credit;  and\n(2) the amount of the benefit payable to the dependent children under Section 7.05(a) is 75 percent of the benefit the member would have been entitled to receive if the member had established the DROP account on becoming eligible for service retirement, but based on not less than 20 years of service credit.\nSec. 8.07. PAYMENTS FROM DROP ACCOUNT AT MEMBER'S DEATH.    (a)  The provisions of Article 7 relating to death benefits of qualified survivors do not apply to amounts credited to a member's DROP account.  Instead, a member who participates in the DROP may designate a beneficiary to receive any balance in the member's DROP account at the member's death.  The beneficiary designation must be made on a form prescribed by the board of trustees and filed with the fund before the member's death.  If the member is married at the time of the designation, designation of a beneficiary other than the member's spouse is valid only if the spouse consents to the designation in writing on the same form that is used to designate the beneficiary.  Distributions from a member's DROP account after the death of the member shall be made as provided by this section.\n(b)  If a member who participates in the DROP dies before distribution of the member's entire DROP account, distributions to the designated beneficiary will begin not more than one year after the date of the member's death and shall be made either as a single-payment distribution of the member's DROP account balance or in not more than four equal annual installments over a period of not more than 37 months.\n(c)  If the member has not designated a beneficiary to receive distributions from the member's DROP account or if the person so designated does not survive the member by at least 72 hours, the member's DROP account shall be distributed in a single-sum payment as soon as administratively possible after the member's death to any surviving spouse who survives the member by at least 72 hours, if any, or to the member's estate if there is no surviving spouse.\nSec. 8.08. SUBSEQUENT DISABILITY OF DROP PARTICIPANT.  A member who participates in the DROP becomes ineligible for any disability benefits described by Article 6 of this Act.  Instead, if the board of trustees determines that the member would have been eligible for disability retirement, the board of trustees shall grant a normal service retirement annuity as described by Section 5.04 of this Act and shall pay the member both the service retirement annuity and a distribution of the DROP account as described by Section 8.05 of this Act.\nSec. 8.09. RETIREMENT BENEFIT PAYABLE TO DROP PARTICIPANT.  The retirement benefit payable under Article 5 or 6 of this Act to a person who participates in the DROP:\n(1) may not be increased as a result of any increase in the formula used in computing service retirement benefits under Section 5.04 of this Act that occurs after the effective date of the member's election to participate in the DROP;\n(2) may not be increased as a result of any increase in the member's compensation that occurs after the effective date of the member's election to participate in the DROP;\n(3) shall be increased by any annual cost-of-living adjustments under Section 9.04 of this Act that occur between the effective date of the member's election to participate in the DROP and the effective date of the member's retirement;\n(4) may not be increased for additional service credit after the effective date of the member's election to participate in the DROP;  and\n(5) is subject to the limitations prescribed by Section 9.03 of this Act.\nSec. 8.10. TERMINATION OR MODIFICATION OF DROP BY FUND.  If the board's actuary, not sooner than January 1, 2000, certifies to the board that DROP participation is resulting in a significant actuarial loss to the fund, the board of trustees may:\n(1) reduce the interest paid on DROP accounts or take other action that would reduce the future credits to DROP accounts, but only for all DROP accounts that are established after the effective date of the action by the board of trustees;  or\n(2) terminate the deferred retirement option plan for all members who have not at that time established a DROP account.\nARTICLE 9. MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS REGARDING BENEFITS\nSec. 9.01. TIME FOR PAYMENT TO RETIRED MEMBERS.  Benefits to a person who retires under this Act are payable on the first day of each month beginning with the month following the month in which the person retires.\nSec. 9.02. TIME FOR PAYMENT TO SURVIVORS;  PAYMENT TO ESTATE.  Benefits to a surviving spouse, dependent child, or dependent parent under this Act are payable on the first day of each month beginning with the month following the month in which the death of the member or former firefighter occurs.  After all payments cease, any amount by which the member's or former firefighter's total accumulated contributions at the date of that person's death exceed the amount of all retirement and death benefits paid by the fund as a result of the person's participation in the fund is payable to the estate of the member or former firefighter.\nSec. 9.03. LIMITATION ON PAYMENT OF BENEFITS.    (a)  If the amount of any benefit payment under this Act would exceed the limitations provided by Section 415 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, and the regulations adopted under that section, the board of trustees shall reduce the amount of the benefit as needed to comply with that section.\n(b) A person's vested accrued benefit in effect on September 1, 1995, may not be reduced under this section.\nSec. 9.04. COST-OF-LIVING ADJUSTMENT;  OTHER ADJUSTMENTS.

A benefit payable under this Act may not be integrated with benefits payable under the federal Social Security Act, as amended (42 U.S.C. Section 301 et seq.), and benefits payable under the Social Security Act may not be taken into account when determining the amount of benefits to which a person is entitled under this Act.\nSec. 9.06. WITHDRAWAL OF CONTRIBUTIONS.    (a)  A living person who has terminated all employment with the fire department and who has not retired may withdraw, on application, all of the accumulated contributions credited to that person's individual account with the fund in excess of the amount of benefits that the person previously has received from the fund.  On withdrawal, the person's account will be closed and all service credit the person has accumulated will be canceled.\n(b) If a member dies before retirement and no person is entitled to a survivor's benefit under this Act, the person's estate may, after application, withdraw all of the accumulated contributions credited to that person's individual account with the fund in excess of the amount of benefits that the person previously has received from the fund.\nSec. 9.07. ESCHEAT OF CONTRIBUTIONS.  If an application for withdrawal of contributions under Section 9.06 of this Act from or on behalf of a person who has ceased to be an employee of the fire department or the person's estate has not been received by the fund before the seventh anniversary of the termination of the person's employment with the fire department for a reason other than retirement, the person's accumulated contributions shall escheat to the fund.  If the person or the person's estate later applies for the contributions, the fund shall refund the contributions regardless of the earlier escheatment.\nSec. 9.08. INSUFFICIENT FUNDS;  PRORATED REDUCTION IN BENEFITS.  If for any reason the funds available for any purpose covered by this Act become insufficient to pay in full any benefit payable under this Act, all benefits being paid by the fund shall be reduced pro rata for the time the deficiency exists.\nSec. 9.09. REDUCTION IN BENEFIT PAYMENTS ON REQUEST.  If a person receiving a benefit from the fund requests in writing that the amount of the benefit be reduced to a specified monthly amount, the fund will pay the lesser amount specified in the request.  If the person subsequently requests in writing that the benefit be increased to any specified amount that does not exceed the amount originally payable, the fund will pay the increased amount specified.  If a person receiving a benefit from the fund requests in writing that payment of the benefit be discontinued, the fund shall discontinue payment of the benefit.  If the person subsequently requests that payment of the benefit be resumed, the fund shall resume payment of the benefit.

An optional retirement annuity is payable throughout the life of the retiree.\n(b) Instead of the annuity payable under Section 5.04 of this Act, a member who retires may elect to receive an optional retirement annuity approved by the board of trustees under this section.\n(c) The survivor's benefits provided under Article 7 of this Act are not payable on the death of a retiree who elects an optional retirement annuity under this section.\n(d) The board of trustees by rule may provide that:\n(1) an optional retirement annuity is payable after a member's death throughout the life of a person designated by the member;  or\n(2) if a retiree dies before a fixed number of monthly annuity payments are made, the remaining number of payments are payable to the retiree's designated beneficiary or, if a designated beneficiary does not exist, to the retiree's estate.\n(e) To elect an optional retirement annuity, a member must make the election and designate a beneficiary on a form prescribed by the board of trustees.  The member must file the form with the board on or before the effective date of the member's retirement.\n(f) Except as provided by Subsections (g), (h), and (i) of this section, if a member elects an optional retirement annuity that, on the member's death, pays to the member's spouse an amount that is less than 75 percent of the annuity that is payable during the joint lives of the member and the member's spouse, the spouse must consent to the election.  The spouse's consent must be in writing and witnessed by an officer or employee of the fund or acknowledged by a notary public.\n(g) If a member's spouse has been adjudicated incompetent, the consent required under Subsection (f) of this section may be given by the spouse's guardian.\n(h) If a physician determines that a member's spouse is not mentally capable of managing the spouse's affairs, the consent required under Subsection (f) of this section may be given by the member if the member would be qualified to serve as a guardian of the spouse and the board of trustees determines that a guardianship of the estate is not necessary.\n(i) Spousal consent under Subsection (f) of this section is not required if the board of trustees determines that:\n(1) a spouse does not exist;\n(2) the spouse cannot be located;\n(3) the first anniversary of the marriage will not occur before the date the annuity first becomes payable;  or\n(4) a former spouse is entitled to receive a portion of the member's optional retirement benefit under a qualified domestic relations order.\nARTICLE 10.

The municipal attorney is not entitled to compensation from the fund for providing that representation.\n(g)  The board may, from fund assets, purchase from an insurer licensed to do business in this state insurance to:\n(1)  provide for legal defense of the fund;\n(2)  cover liabilities and losses of the fund;\n(3)  cover any other insurable risk to the fund; and\n(4)  provide for the legal defense of or indemnify and hold harmless the trustees of the board and employees of the fund from the effects and consequences of their acts, errors, omissions, or other conduct within the scope of their duties as trustees or employees, whether the acts, errors, omissions, or other conduct is proven or merely alleged.\n(g-1)  The board may use fund assets to provide insurance coverage comparable to that provided by insurers under Subsection (g) of this section by entering into a collective pool providing governmental entities of this state with self-insurance coverage, including coverage authorized by Chapter 791 or 2259, Government Code, or Chapter 119, Local Government Code.  This article does not limit the ability of the board to provide any type of group insurance or self-insurance coverage in a pool of governmental entities for fund employees and their beneficiaries as a benefit of employment.\n(g-2)  If insurance or pooled governmental self-insurance coverage is unavailable, insufficient, inadequate, or not in effect, the board may indemnify a board trustee or employee for liability imposed as damages and for reasonable costs and expenses incurred by that individual in defense of an alleged act, error, or omission committed in the individual's official capacity or within the scope of what the board trustee or employee believed in good faith, at the time, to be the board trustee's or employee's official capacity.

The self-insurance fund shall be invested in the same manner as other assets of the fund, and all earnings and losses from investing the self-insurance fund shall be credited to the self-insurance fund unless that credit exceeds the limit on the self-insurance fund set by the board or this subsection.  Amounts held in the self-insurance fund may not be included in the actuarial valuation for purposes of determining the municipal contribution rate or the assets available to satisfy the actuarial liabilities of the fund to pay service, disability, or death benefits provided by this article.  A decision to indemnify or make a reimbursement out of the self-insurance fund must be made by a majority vote of board trustees eligible to vote on the matter.

The protection from liability provided by this subsection is cumulative of and in addition to any other constitutional, statutory, or common law official or governmental immunity, defense, and civil or procedural protection provided to the fund as a governmental entity and to a fund trustee or employee as an official or employee of a governmental entity.  Except for a waiver expressly provided by this article, this article does not grant an implied waiver of any immunity.\n(m) The board, or a committee of the board sitting in review of medical or psychiatric records, may consider the medical or psychiatric records of multiple individual applicants for disability benefits within a single closed session under Section 551.078, Government Code, but any action on an application shall be taken on an individual basis.\n(n)  On the reported death of a member, the fund or an authorized representative of the fund may obtain the death certificate or the pending death certificate directly from the issuing examiner or governmental agency without the prior notification or confirmation that otherwise may be required under law to expedite the issuance of death benefits from the fund to survivors in need of those benefits.\nSec. 3A.

(a)  Except as provided by Subsection (b) of this section, the board is authorized, on behalf of the members or beneficiaries of the fund, to alter benefit types or amounts, the means of determining contribution rates, or the contribution rates provided under this article if the alteration is included in a written agreement between the board and the municipality.  An agreement entered into under this section:\n(1)  must:\n(A)  if the agreement concerns benefit increases, other than benefit increases that are the result of Section 13E of this article, adhere to the processes and standards set forth in Section 10 of this article; and\n(B)  operate prospectively only; and\n(2)  may not, except as provided by Sections 13A through 13F of this article, have the effect or result of increasing the unfunded liability of the fund.\n(b)  In a written agreement entered into between the municipality and the board under this section, the parties may not:\n(1)  alter Sections 13A through 13F of this article, except and only to the extent necessary to comply with federal law;\n(2)  increase the assumed rate of return to more than seven percent per year;\n(3)  extend the amortization period of a liability layer to more than 30 years from the first day of the fiscal year beginning 12 months after the date of the risk sharing valuation study in which the liability layer is first recognized; or\n(4)  allow a municipal contribution rate in any year that is less than or greater than the municipal contribution rate required under Section 13E or 13F of this article, as applicable.\n(c)  If the board is directed or authorized in Sections 13A through 13F of this article to effect an increase or decrease to benefits or contributions, this article delegates the authority to alter provisions concerning benefits and contributions otherwise stated in this article in accordance with the direction or authorization only to the extent the alteration is set forth in an order or other written instrument and is consistent with this section, the code, and other applicable federal law and regulations.  The order or other written instrument must be included in each applicable risk sharing valuation study under Section 13B or 13C of this article, as applicable, adopted by the board, and published in a manner that makes the order or other written instrument accessible to the members.\nSec. 4.

These additional benefits may not be increased under Section 11(c), (c-1), or (c-2) of this article.\nSec. 5. DEFERRED RETIREMENT OPTION PLAN.    (a)  A member who is eligible to receive a service pension under Section 4(a)(1) of this article and who remains in active service may elect to participate in the deferred retirement option plan provided by this section.  A member who is eligible to receive a service pension under Section 4(a)(2) of this article may not elect to participate in the deferred retirement option plan provided by this section. On subsequently terminating active service, a member who elected the DROP may apply for a monthly service pension under Section 4 of this article, except that the effective date of the member's election to participate in the DROP will be considered the member's retirement date for determining the amount of the member's monthly service pension.  The member may also apply for any DROP benefit provided under this section on terminating active service.  An election to participate in the DROP, once approved by the board, is irrevocable.\n(a-1)  The monthly benefit of a DROP participant who has at least 20 years of participation on the year 2017 effective date is increased at retirement by two percent of the amount of the member's original benefit for every full year of participation in the DROP by the member for up to 10 years of participation in the DROP.  For a member's final year of participation, but not beyond the member's 10th year in the DROP, if a full year of participation is not completed, the member shall receive a prorated increase of 0.166 percent of the member's original benefit for each month of participation in that year.  An increase provided by this subsection does not apply to benefits payable under Subsection (l) of this section.  An increase under this subsection is applied to the member's benefit at retirement and is not added to the member's DROP account.  The total increase under this subsection may not exceed 20 percent for 10 years of participation in the DROP by the member.\n(b)  A member may elect to participate in the DROP by complying with the election process established by the board.  The member's election may be made at any time beginning on the date the member has completed 20 years of participation in the fund and is otherwise eligible for a service pension under Section 4(a)(1) of this article.  Beginning on the first day of the month following the month in which the member makes an election to participate in the DROP, subject to board approval, and ending on the year 2017 effective date, amounts equal to the deductions made from the member's salary under Section 13(c) of this article shall be credited to the member's DROP account.  Beginning after the year 2017 effective date, amounts equal to the deductions made from the member's salary under Section 13(c) of this article may not be credited to the member's DROP account.\n(b-1)  On or after the year 2017 effective date, an active member may not participate in the DROP for more than 13 years.  If a DROP participant remains in active service after the 13th anniversary of the effective date of the member's DROP election:\n(1)  subsequent deductions from the member's salary under Section 13(c) of this article, except for unused leave pay, may not be credited to the member's DROP account; and\n(2)  the account shall continue to be credited with earnings in accordance with Subsection (d) of this section.\n(b-2)  For a member who is a DROP participant, the fund shall credit to the member's DROP account, in accordance with Section 13(c-1) of this article, the amount of unused leave pay otherwise payable to the member and received as a contribution to the fund from the municipality.\n(c)  After a member's DROP election becomes effective, an amount equal to the monthly service pension the member would have received under Section 4 of this article, if applicable, had the member terminated active service on the effective date of the member's DROP election shall be credited to a DROP account maintained for the member.  That monthly credit to the member's DROP account shall continue until the earlier of the date the member terminates active service or the 13th anniversary of the date of the first credit to the member's DROP account.\n(d)  A member's DROP account shall be credited with earnings at an annual rate equal to 65 percent of the compounded average annual return earned by the fund over the five years preceding, but not including, the year during which the credit is given.  Notwithstanding the preceding, however, the credit to the member's DROP account shall be at an annual rate of not less than 2.5 percent, irrespective of actual earnings.\n(d-1)  Earnings credited to a member's DROP account under Subsection (d) of this section shall be computed and credited at a time and in a manner determined by the board, except that earnings shall be credited not less frequently than once in each 13-month period and shall take into account partial years of participation in the DROP.\n(d-2)  A member may not roll over accumulated unused sick or vacation time paid to the member as a lump-sum payment after termination of active service into the member's DROP account.\n(e) A member who terminates active service after participating in the DROP is entitled to receive, in addition to the member's service pension under Section 4 of this article, a benefit equal to the balance of the member's DROP account.\n(e-1)  In lieu of receiving a lump-sum payment on termination from active service, a retired member who has been a DROP participant or, if termination from active service was due to the DROP participant's death, the surviving spouse of the DROP participant may elect to leave the retired member's DROP account with the fund and receive earnings credited to the DROP account in the manner described by Subsection (d) of this section.\n(f) In lieu of a single lump-sum payment, a member may elect to receive partial payments from the member's DROP account for each calendar year, in an amount elected by the member.  The board may establish procedures concerning partial payments, including limitations on timing and frequency of those payments.  A member who elects partial payments may, at any time, elect to receive the member's entire remaining DROP account balance in a single lump-sum payment.\n(g) If a member elects partial payments, for periods after a member terminates active service and before the member's DROP account is completely distributed, the member's DROP account shall be credited with earnings of the fund as computed under Subsection (d) of this section.\n(h) An election by a member concerning single lump-sum or partial payments as provided by Subsection (e) or (f) of this section must satisfy the requirements of Section 401(a)(9) of the code.  All distributions and changes in form of distribution must be made in a manner and at a time that comply with that provision of the code.\n(i)  The day immediately before the date the DROP participant's election becomes effective is the last day used for purposes of computing and providing service pension benefits under Section 4 of this article or for purposes of computing and providing death benefits under Section 7 of this article.  A salary earned or additional years of participation completed after the member's DROP election becomes effective may not be considered in the computation of retirement or death benefits, except for the limited purpose of percentage increases provided under Subsection (a) of this section.\n(j)  If a DROP participant dies before complete distribution of the member's DROP account has been made, the member's DROP account balance shall be distributed to the member's eligible beneficiaries, determined as follows:\n(1)  if the member is survived by a spouse who was the member's spouse on the date the member's DROP election became effective and one or more eligible children, one-half of the member's DROP account balance shall be paid to that eligible spouse, and the remaining one-half shall be divided equally among the member's eligible children;\n(2)  if the member is survived by a spouse described by Subdivision (1) of this subsection, but not by an eligible child, the member's entire DROP account balance shall be paid to the surviving spouse;\n(3)  if the member is survived by one or more eligible children, but not by a spouse described by Subdivision (1) of this subsection, the member's DROP account balance shall be divided equally among the eligible children;\n(4)  if the member is not survived by a spouse described by Subdivision (1) of this subsection or an eligible child, the member's DROP account balance shall be divided equally among the member's eligible parents;\n(5)  if the member is not survived by a spouse described by Subdivision (1) of this subsection, an eligible child, or an eligible parent, the member's DROP account balance shall be distributed in accordance with the member's beneficiary designation filed with the board or, if the member has failed to file a valid beneficiary designation, to the member's estate;\n(6)  if a member's spouse described by Subdivision (1) of this subsection was not married to the member on the date the member's DROP election became effective, the spouse shall receive a reduced benefit equal to the benefit otherwise payable to the surviving spouse under this subsection, multiplied by the percentage of the period between the member's DROP election and the date the member left active service during which the spouse and the member were married, and the amount by which the spouse's benefit is reduced shall be divided among any other eligible survivors as if the member did not have an eligible spouse or, if there are no eligible survivors, distributed in accordance with the member's beneficiary designation filed with the board, or if the member failed to file a valid beneficiary designation, to the member's estate; and\n(7)  if the conditions described by Subdivision (1), (2), or (6) of this subsection exist, the surviving spouse may elect to maintain the DROP account with the fund in the same manner described by Subsections (e), (f), and (g) of this section.\n(j-1)  Only for the purpose of distributing a member's DROP account under Subsection (j) of this section, a person who is designated a beneficiary adult child in a valid beneficiary designation filed by the member with the board is considered an eligible child.  A designation under this subsection is distinct from the member's beneficiary designation under Subsection (j)(5) of this section.\n(k) An eligible beneficiary's share of a deceased member's DROP account shall be distributed as soon as administratively practicable after the member's death in the form of a single lump-sum payment, unless the surviving spouse makes the election permitted by Subsection (j)(7) of this section.  All distributions to beneficiaries under this subsection must be made in a manner and at a time that comply with Section 401(a)(9) of the code.\n(l) A member who participates in the DROP is ineligible for disability benefits described by Section 6 of this article, except the benefits described by Section 6(c).  If a member who has a disability described by Section 6(c) of this article is a DROP participant, the disability benefit provided by Section 6(c)(1) shall be paid to the member, as a monthly pension benefit, in addition to payments from the DROP account balance.  If a member who dies under the conditions described by Section 7(c) of this article is a DROP participant at the time of death or disability resulting in death, the benefit provided by Section 7(c) shall be paid to the member's eligible survivors, as a monthly pension benefit, in addition to payments from the DROP account balance.\n(m)  A DROP participant with a break in service may receive service credit within DROP for days worked after the regular expiration of the maximum DROP participation period prescribed by this section.  The service credit shall be limited to the number of days in which the participant experienced a break in service or the number of days required to constitute 13 years of DROP participation, whichever is smaller.  A retired member who previously participated in the DROP and who returns to active service is subject to the terms of this section in effect at the time of the member's return to active service.\n(n) After August 31, 2000, the board may set a date after which additional members will not be allowed to elect to participate in the DROP. A member whose election to participate in the DROP becomes effective before a deadline established by the board is entitled to continue participating in the DROP.\n(o) A member who has made a DROP election is not classified as retired, eligible to be paid, or eligible to accrue or to receive any benefit that is accrued or received by a member who has terminated active service or by the eligible survivors of deceased members unless the member who has made the DROP election has terminated active service.\n(p) A member participating in the DROP who was qualified to make a DROP election before the actual date of the member's election may elect to have the member's DROP account recomputed by participating in a Back-DROP. Under a Back-DROP election, the member's account balance is equal to the amount that the account would have had if the member had elected to participate in the DROP on an earlier date chosen by the member.  The Back-DROP date chosen by the member may not be earlier than the later of the date that is three years before the date the member elected to participate in the DROP, or September 1, 1995.  The member's choice of a Back-DROP date is irrevocable, except as provided by Subsection (r) of this section.\n(q)  A member may revoke the member's Back-DROP election by notifying the fund in writing not later than the earlier of:\n(1)  the date the member leaves active service; or\n(2)  the 10th business day after the date the member signs an application form for a Back-DROP.\n(r) A member may revoke the date chosen under a Back-DROP election and choose an earlier Back-DROP date only if:\n(1)  the first date the member chooses is not the earliest date permitted under Subsection (p) of this section;  and\n(2)  the board determines that the member's injury or illness has caused the member to be separated from service earlier than the member anticipated.\nSec. 5A.  POST-RETIREMENT OPTION PLAN.  (a)  The following persons may elect to participate in the post-retirement option plan provided by this section:\n(1)  a member who terminates active service after participating in the DROP and who is eligible to receive a service pension or other taxable benefits under Section 5 of this article;\n(2)  a retired member, whether or not that member was a DROP participant, who is eligible to receive a service pension or other taxable benefits under Section 4 of this article; or\n(3)  a surviving spouse of a member who elects and is eligible to participate in the PROP under Subsection (f) of this section.\n(b)  A PROP participant may elect to have all or part of the amount that the participant would otherwise receive as a monthly service pension or other taxable benefits under this article, less any amount the board determines is required to pay the participant's share of group medical insurance costs, credited to the participant's PROP account.  The participant's PROP account shall be credited with hypothetical earnings in the same manner as the amounts in a member's DROP account under Section 5(d) of this article.  At any time, a PROP participant may stop the amounts being credited to the participant's PROP account and elect to resume receiving the participant's monthly service pension or other taxable benefits under this article.\n(c)  A member or surviving spouse who elects to participate in the PROP shall comply with the PROP election process established by the board.\n(d)  Subject to rules and procedures adopted by the board, a PROP participant may elect to receive partial payments from the participant's PROP account in an amount determined by the participant.  The board may establish rules and procedures concerning partial payments, including limitations on timing and frequency of those payments.  A PROP participant who elects partial payments may, at any time, elect to receive the PROP participant's entire remaining PROP account balance in a single lump-sum payment.  If, at any time after the initial credit to the PROP account, a participant's PROP account balance becomes zero, the account closes and the participant's participation in the PROP ceases.  A person whose PROP account has been closed because of a zero balance is not eligible to again participate in the PROP.\n(e)  An election by a member or surviving spouse to receive a single lump-sum payment or partial payments under Subsection (d) of this section must satisfy the requirements of Section 401(a)(9) of the code.  All distributions and changes in the form of distribution must be made in a manner and at a time that comply with that section of the code.\n(f)  The board by rule or policy may permit a member's surviving spouse to elect to participate in the PROP by choosing either or both of the following options:\n(1)  continuing a deceased member's PROP account; or\n(2)  establishing a PROP account in which to receive credits from all or part of the surviving spouse's survivor benefits.\n(g)  A surviving spouse PROP participant and the participant's PROP account are subject to this section and any additional rules the board may adopt relating to PROP accounts and participants generally or to surviving spouse PROP accounts and participants particularly.  The board may, by rule, further restrict or define, through the establishment of reasonable categories, who is a surviving spouse of a member for purposes of this section.\n(h)  If a member who is a PROP participant dies before complete distribution of the participant's PROP account has been made, the participant's PROP account balance shall be distributed in the same manner as a DROP account balance is distributed under Sections 5(j), (j-1), and (k) of this article, except for amounts subject to a surviving spouse's election under Subsection (f) of this section that results in the nondistribution from the plan of all or part of the deceased participant's PROP account.\n(i)  Only benefits that are taxable under the code may be credited to a PROP account.  Nontaxable disability benefits or other nontaxable benefits, including the nontaxable part of any benefit, may not be credited to a PROP account.\n(j)  The board may set a date after which additional members or surviving spouses will not be allowed to elect to participate in the PROP.\n(k)  The board may set a date after which the crediting of additional benefits of a member or a surviving spouse to a PROP account is not allowed.\n(l)  The board by rule or policy may limit the number of distribution transactions for all PROP participants or for any category of PROP participants.\n(m)  The board by rule or policy may establish a minimum dollar amount allowed for crediting of benefit amounts to a PROP account.\n(n)  The board may adopt rules, policies, or procedures that the board determines are necessary or desirable to implement or administer this section.\n(o)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this article, on or after the year 2017 effective date:\n(1)  a PROP participant may not have any additional amounts that the participant would otherwise receive as a monthly service pension or other benefits under this article credited to the participant's PROP account; and\n(2)  a person, including a member or surviving spouse, may not elect to participate in the PROP.\nSec. 6. DISABILITY PENSION BENEFITS.    (a)  If the board determines that a member has suffered an on-duty disability, the member is entitled to an on-duty disability pension as provided by this section in lieu of any other benefit under this article.\n(b)  If the board determines that a member is not capable of performing the usual and customary duties of the member's classification or position because of the member's on-duty disability, the member is entitled to receive a monthly disability pension, beginning after the effective date of the member's termination of active service, in an amount equal to the greater of:\n(1)  50 percent of the member's average monthly salary; or\n(2)  the service pension the member would have been entitled to receive under Section 4 of this article based on years of participation as of the effective date of the member's termination of active service.\n(c)  If the board determines that a member is not capable of performing any substantial gainful activity because of the member's on-duty disability, the member is entitled to receive a monthly disability pension, beginning after the effective date of the member's termination of active service, in an amount equal to the greater of:\n(1)  75 percent of the member's average monthly salary; or\n(2)  the service pension the member would have been entitled to receive under Section 4 of this article based on years of participation on the effective date of the member's termination of active service.\n(d) If a full-time active member with at least six years of service becomes disabled or dies from heart or lung disease or cancer, and the member successfully passed a physical examination before the claimed disability or death or on beginning employment as a firefighter, and the examination failed to reveal any evidence of the heart or lung disease or cancer, that condition will be presumed to have caused an on-duty disability for purposes of determining eligibility for disability benefits under this section, and the amount of the disability benefit is presumed to constitute, unless the presumption is rebutted, the pension amount that shall be used to determine the death benefit payable with respect to that member.  The on-duty disability presumption may be rebutted only by clear and convincing evidence.  Another statutory presumption regarding the cause of illnesses or conditions does not affect any benefit payable under this article.\n(e)  If the board determines that a member is not capable of performing the usual and customary duties of the member's classification or position because of the member's off-duty disability, the member is entitled to an off-duty disability pension in lieu of any other benefit under this article.  If the board makes that determination, the member is entitled to receive a monthly disability pension, beginning after the effective date of the member's termination of active service, in an amount equal to the greater of:\n(1)  25 percent of the member's average monthly salary, plus 2-1/2 percent of the member's average monthly salary for each full year of participation in the fund, except that the total monthly disability pension under this subdivision may not exceed 50 percent of the member's average monthly salary; or\n(2)  the service pension the member would have been entitled to receive under Section 4 of this article based on years of participation on the effective date of the member's termination of active service.\n(f) A member is not eligible for an on-duty or off-duty disability pension as provided by this section if the member's on-duty or off-duty disability is a direct and proximate result of a condition that existed on the date the member began membership in the fund.  In that event, if the member is not eligible to receive a service pension under Section 4 of this article, the member may elect any deferred pension or refund of contributions for which the member is eligible under Section 8 of this article.  A member has a preexisting condition under this subsection if the board determines that the member had:\n(1)  symptoms that would cause an ordinarily prudent person to seek diagnosis, care, or treatment during the five-year period before the effective date of the member's membership in the fund;  or\n(2)  a condition for which medical advice or treatment was recommended by or received from a physician during the five-year period before the effective date of the member's membership in the fund.\n(g) The board shall review, on a case-by-case basis, existing benefit payments to members, and to survivors of deceased members, who retired as a result of a disability with 20 or more years of service under a provision of any predecessor statute previously governing the fund.  The review will determine whether the member's disability was an on-duty disability that satisfies the requirements of Subsection (b) or (c) of this section.  A determination that a member's disability was an on-duty disability, as described above, will apply only on a prospective basis beginning with January 1 of the calendar year in which the determination is made and will not affect the amount of the member's or survivor's benefits.  The board shall make its review and determination under this subsection on the basis of the medical evidence and any other relevant non-testimonial evidence that was previously submitted in connection with the prior application for benefits, except that if the board finds that the historical file is insufficient to make the determination, supplemental evidence of a probative nature may be adduced and accepted to help make the determination.\n(h) A person may not receive an on-duty or off-duty disability pension from the fund unless the person or the person's legal representative files with the board an application for disability benefits, in the form approved by the board, and certificates of the member's disability signed and sworn to by the member and the member's physician or by a physician selected by the board.  The board may require other or additional evidence of disability before authorizing payment of disability pension benefits.\n(i) The board shall make all determinations concerning benefits under this section in accordance with uniform principles consistently applied on the basis of medical or other evidence that the board determines is necessary or desirable.\nSec. 7. DEATH BENEFITS.    (a)  If a member dies who is eligible to receive a service pension under Section 4 of this article, a disability pension under Section 6 of this article, or a deferred pension under Section 8(a) of this article, or who is receiving those benefits, the member's eligible survivors are entitled to death benefits as follows:\n(1)  if the member is survived by both an eligible spouse and one or more eligible children, the eligible spouse is entitled to receive a monthly death benefit equal to one-half of the amount the member would have been entitled to receive, and the surviving eligible children are entitled to receive a monthly death benefit equal to the remainder of the amount the member would have been entitled to receive, divided equally among the eligible children;\n(2)  if the member is not survived by an eligible child, or if at any time after the death of the member an eligible child is not entitled to a benefit, the monthly death benefit to be paid the eligible spouse is equal to the full amount the member would have been entitled to receive;\n(3)  if the member is not survived by an eligible spouse, or if the member's eligible spouse dies after being entitled to a death benefit under this section, the surviving eligible children are entitled to receive a monthly death benefit equal to the full monthly pension benefit the member would have been entitled to receive, divided equally among the member's eligible children then living;  and\n(4)  if the member is not survived by an eligible spouse or an eligible child, a monthly death benefit equal to the full monthly pension benefit the member would have been entitled to receive shall be divided among the eligible parents of the deceased member.\n(b) If a member's eligible spouse was married to the member for less than five years and was not married to the member at the time the member left active service, the eligible spouse shall be paid a reduced benefit equal to the benefit otherwise payable to the eligible spouse under this section, multiplied by the number of months the eligible spouse was married to the member, and divided by 60 months. Any benefit the eligible spouse may be granted under Section 10A of this article shall be reduced in the same proportion as the reduced benefit provided by this subsection.  The amount by which the eligible spouse's benefit is reduced shall be divided among any other eligible survivors as if the member did not have an eligible spouse.  This subsection may not be construed to effect any reduction to an eligible spouse of benefits otherwise payable under Section 4(d) of this article.\n(c) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, if a member dies in the course of the performance of the member's duties as a firefighter or suffers an on-duty disability and dies as a result of the bodily injuries that caused the on-duty disability, death benefits based on the member's service shall be computed on the basis of a benefit equal to 100 percent of the deceased member's average monthly salary.\n(d) If a member dies after benefit payments have begun or at a time the member could have terminated active service and elected to receive a service pension or deferred pension immediately, the death benefits payable under this section shall begin or continue effective as of the member's date of death.  If a member who is not entitled to receive any monthly pension benefit under this article other than a deferred pension under Section 8(a) of this article dies before age 50, any monthly death benefits payable under this section shall begin on the date the deceased member would have reached age 50.\n(e) In addition to the monthly death benefit provided under Subsection (a) of this section, if an active member or a member receiving a service pension under Section 4 of this article or a disability pension under Section 6 of this article dies on or after July 1, 1998, the member's eligible survivors are entitled to a one-time $5,000 death benefit, payable as a lump sum as follows:\n(1)  if the member is survived by an eligible spouse, the eligible spouse is entitled to receive $5,000;\n(2)  if the member is not survived by an eligible spouse, the member's eligible children are entitled to receive $5,000, divided equally among those children;\n(3)  if the member is not survived by an eligible spouse or an eligible child, the $5,000 death benefit shall be divided equally among the eligible parents of the deceased member;  or\n(4)  if the member is not survived by an eligible spouse, an eligible child, or an eligible parent, the $5,000 death benefit shall be paid to the deceased member's estate or to the member's court-approved small estate through its legal representative.\n(f) A member in active service who dies, for purposes of Subsection (a) of this section, shall be treated as having become disabled because of the member's cause of death on the date of the member's death.\n(g) If a member in active service dies and does not leave an eligible survivor, or the eligible survivors unanimously elect such a benefit in lieu of any other death benefit, a lump-sum benefit shall be paid in an amount equal to the refund, if any, to which the member would have been entitled under Section 8 of this article had the member terminated service on the date of the member's death.  That lump-sum benefit shall be paid to the eligible survivors as provided by Subsection (a) of this section or, if there are not any eligible survivors, to the member's designated beneficiary.  A member's beneficiary must be designated before the member's death on a form approved by the board.  If more than one beneficiary is designated, the benefit shall be divided equally among the beneficiaries unless a different allocation is provided in the designation.  If a member fails to properly designate a beneficiary, the benefit provided by this subsection shall be payable to the member's estate or to the member's court-approved small estate through its legal representative on application by the estate or legal representative.  Money payable under this subsection may not escheat to the state.\n(h) Death benefits are not payable under this article, including benefits to any survivor, based on a member's service if the board determines that the member's death resulted from suicide or attempted suicide that occurred before the member completed two years of participation or that the member's death resulted from a disability arising out of an attempted suicide that occurred before the member completed two years of participation.\n(i) A benefit payable under this section to a member's eligible child ceases when the child ceases to be an eligible child.\n(j) An eligible spouse is entitled to receive or continue to receive survivor benefits on remarriage, except that a person who is an eligible spouse of more than one member is entitled to receive survivor benefits as the eligible spouse of only the member whose survivor benefits provide the highest benefit to that eligible spouse.\nSec. 8.  DEFERRED PENSION AT AGE 50; REFUND OF CONTRIBUTIONS.  (a)  On or after the year 2017 effective date, a member who is hired as a firefighter before the year 2017 effective date, including a member who was hired before the year 2017 effective date and who involuntarily separated from service but has been retroactively reinstated in accordance with an arbitration, civil service, or court ruling, terminates active service for any reason other than death with at least 10 years of participation, but less than 20 years of participation, is entitled to a monthly deferred pension benefit, beginning at age 50, in an amount equal to 1.7 percent of the member's average monthly salary multiplied by the amount of the member's years of participation.\n(b)  In lieu of the deferred pension benefit provided under Subsection (a) of this section, a member who terminates active service for any reason other than death with at least 10 years of participation, but less than 20 years of participation, may elect to receive a lump-sum refund of the member's contributions to the fund with interest computed at five percent, not compounded, for the member's contributions to the fund made before the year 2017 effective date and without interest for the member's contributions to the fund made on or after the year 2017 effective date.  A member's election to receive a refund of contributions must be made on a form approved by the board.  The member's refund shall be paid as soon as administratively practicable after the member's election is received.\n(c)  Except as provided by Subsection (a) of this section, a member who is hired or rehired as a firefighter on or after the year 2017 effective date or a member who terminates employment for any reason other than death before the member has completed 10 years of participation is entitled only to a refund of the member's contributions without interest and is not entitled to a deferred pension benefit under this section or to any other benefit under this article.  The member's refund shall be paid as soon as administratively practicable after the effective date of the member's termination of active service.\nSec. 9. PROOF OF CONTINUED DISABILITY.    (a)  The board may at any time require a person receiving a disability pension or receiving death benefits as a disabled child under this article to undergo a medical examination by a physician appointed or selected by the board for that purpose.\n(b) A person retired for disability under Section 6(c) of this article or a person receiving death benefits as a disabled child under Section 7 of this article must file an annual report of employment activities and earnings with the board.  The board shall establish the form of the report and the time for filing the report.\n(c) The result of the examination, the report by the physician, and the report of employment activities and earnings shall be considered by the board in determining whether the relief in the case shall be continued, increased if less than the maximum provided, decreased, or discontinued.  The board may reduce or entirely discontinue all benefits to a person receiving benefits under this article who, after notice from the board, fails to appear for a required medical examination or fails to file the report of employment activities and earnings.\nSec. 10. NONSTATUTORY BENEFIT INCREASES.  The benefits provided by this article may be increased if:\n(1)  an actuary selected by the board who, if an individual, is a Fellow of the Society of Actuaries, a Fellow of the Conference of Actuaries in Public Practice, or a member of the American Academy of Actuaries determines that the increase cannot reasonably be viewed as posing a material risk of jeopardizing the fund's ability to pay any existing benefit;\n(2)  a majority of the participating members of the fund vote for the increase by a secret ballot;\n(3)  the increase does not deprive a member, without the member's written consent, of a right to receive benefits that have already become fully vested and matured in a member;  and\n(4)  the State Pension Review Board approves the determination by the actuary selected by the board that the increase cannot reasonably be viewed as posing a material risk of jeopardizing the fund's ability to pay any existing benefit.\nSec. 10A. ANNUAL SUPPLEMENTAL BENEFIT FOR CERTAIN RETIRED MEMBERS AND ELIGIBLE SURVIVORS.    (a)  The board shall pay supplemental benefits under this section to retired members and eligible survivors who are receiving retirement or survivor benefits on June 30 of the year preceding the year in which the supplemental benefits are to be paid. Deferred retirees or survivors of deferred retirees may not receive supplemental benefits under this section.\n(b) The board shall pay the supplemental benefits under this section each January.\n(c) For purposes of this section, the minimum income level is the federal poverty guideline for a family of five as issued by the United States Department of Health and Human Services, rounded up to the nearest $1,000.\n(d) The aggregate supplemental benefit amount is $5 million.\n(e) Based on the aggregate supplemental benefit amount under Subsection (d) of this section, the board shall determine the amount of a lump-sum payment for each retired member or eligible survivor.\n(f)  In determining the lump-sum payment amount, the total number of years since the commencement date of each retired member's or eligible survivor's annual retirement or survivor benefit shall be divided by the total number of years since the commencement date of all retired members' and eligible survivors' annual retirement or survivor benefit to establish a payment percentage for each retired member and eligible survivor.  For purposes of this section, benefits provided under Section 4(d) of this article may not be included in a retired member's or eligible survivor's annual retirement or survivor benefit.\n(g) The payment percentage of each retired member and eligible survivor shall be multiplied by the aggregate supplemental benefit less the total amount of any payments made under Subsection (i) of this section.\n(h) The product of the computation under Subsection (g) of this section determines the lump-sum payment to the retired member or eligible survivor unless the lump-sum payment plus the annual retirement benefit is less than the minimum income level under Subsection (c).\n(i) If the lump-sum payment plus the annual retirement benefit is less than the minimum income level under Subsection (c) of this section, the retired member or eligible survivor is entitled to receive an additional payment from the amount determined under Subsection (d) of this section that will cause payments to the recipient to meet but not exceed the minimum income level.\n(j) The benefits commencement date for a retired member or the eligible survivor of a retired member is the first day on which the retired member most recently began receiving pension benefits from the fund.  The benefits commencement date for an eligible survivor of an active member is the first day of receipt of benefits as an eligible survivor.\n(k) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, if more than one eligible survivor is to receive a supplemental benefit as a result of one deceased person under this section:\n(1)  only one eligible survivor is considered in computations under this section other than computations under Subdivision (2) of this subsection and as receiving the payments received by all eligible survivors of the one deceased person;  and\n(2)  the amount of payments under this section will be paid to the eligible survivors in the same manner as payments under Sections 7(a) and (b) of this article are made.\n(l) All actuarial determinations required under this section must be made by the fund's actuary.\nSec. 10B. ADDITIONAL LUMP-SUM RETIREMENT OR DEATH BENEFIT.    (a)  The board shall pay the following members a $5,000 lump-sum payment from the fund, in addition to any other benefits, as soon as administratively practicable after the date of the member's retirement:\n(1)  each member who retires or retired after completing 20 years of service and is eligible to receive service pension benefits under Section 4 of this article;  and\n(2)  each member who retires or retired and is eligible to receive disability benefits under Section 6 of this article.\n(b) The board shall pay a $5,000 lump-sum payment from the fund, in addition to any other benefits, to an eligible survivor of a member:\n(1)  who had not terminated active service;  and\n(2)  who was eligible to receive service pension benefits under Section 4 of this article or disability benefits under Section 6 of this article.\n(c) If more than one eligible survivor of one deceased member exists, the amount of each survivor's benefit is determined in the same manner as payment of death benefits is determined under Section 7(e) of this article.  The board shall make payments under Subsection (b) of this section as soon as administratively practicable after the date of death of the member of whom each recipient is an eligible survivor.\nSec. 11. GENERAL PROVISIONS FOR CALCULATION AND PAYMENT OF BENEFITS.    (a)  A member, eligible survivor, or beneficiary of a member is not entitled to receive payments from a fund under more than one section of this article in a particular capacity.  However, a person may be entitled to benefits both as a member and as a survivor or beneficiary of another member.\n(b) The amounts of all benefits that the member or the member's beneficiaries may become entitled to receive from the fund shall be computed on the basis of the schedule of benefits in effect for the fund at the member's election either on the day the member leaves active service or on the day the member ceases to carry out the member's regular duties as a firefighter, without adjustment for any subsequent increases of benefits unless those increases are expressly made applicable to previously retired members or their beneficiaries.\n(c)  Subject to Subsection (c-3) of this section and except as provided by Subsection (c-4) of this section, beginning with the fiscal year ending June 30, 2021, the benefits, including survivor benefits, payable based on the service of a member who has terminated active service and who is or would have been at least 55 years old, received or is receiving an on-duty disability pension under Section 6(c) of this article, or died under the conditions described by Section 7(c) of this article, shall be increased in October of each year by a percentage rate equal to the most recent five fiscal years' smoothed return, as determined by the fund actuary, minus 475 basis points.\n(c-1)  Subject to Subsection (c-3) of this section and except as provided by Subsection (c-4) of this section, for the fund's fiscal years ending June 30, 2018, and June 30, 2019, the benefits, including survivor benefits, payable based on the service of a member who is or would have been at least 70 years old and who received or is receiving a service pension under Section 4 of this article, received or is receiving an on-duty disability pension under Section 6(c) of this article, or died under the conditions described by Section 7(c) of this article, shall be adjusted in October of each applicable fiscal year by a percentage rate equal to the most recent five fiscal years' smoothed return, as determined by the fund actuary, minus 500 basis points.\n(c-2)  Subject to Subsection (c-3) of this section and except as provided by Subsection (c-4) of this section, for the fund's fiscal year ending June 30, 2020, members described by Subsection (c-1) of this section shall receive the increase provided under Subsection (c) of this section.\n(c-3)  The percentage rate prescribed by Subsections (c), (c-1), and (c-2) of this section may not be less than zero percent or more than four percent, irrespective of the return rate of the fund's investment portfolio.\n(c-4)  Each year after the year 2017 effective date, a member who elects to participate in the DROP under Section 5 of this article may not receive the increase provided under Subsection (c), (c-1), or (c-2) of this section in any October during which the member participates in the DROP.\n(d) In computing a member's years of participation, time served in the armed forces of the nation during war or national emergency is considered continuous service.  Except for that military service, credit for prior service shall be given only if a member returns to active service as a firefighter before the fifth anniversary of a previous effective date of termination.  Notwithstanding any provision of this article to the contrary, contributions, benefits, and service credit with respect to qualified military service shall be provided in accordance with Section 414(u) of the code.  A member who is engaged in active duty in any of the military services of the United States shall receive credited pension service for the period of the military service if the member returns to employment with the employer municipality's fire department with an honorable discharge within the period required by the federal reemployment Act and the period of military service does not exceed the period prescribed by that Act.  If a member sustains an injury while on military leave under the terms of the federal reemployment Act, pension benefits are payable based on the off-duty disability benefit provisions prescribed by Section 6(e) of this article.  If a member dies while on military leave under the terms of the federal reemployment Act, death benefits are payable to eligible survivors based on the off-duty death benefits prescribed by Section 7 of this article.  This subsection is intended to comply with the federal reemployment Act.  The board may make, maintain, and amend policies and procedures as desirable or necessary to implement the federal reemployment Act.  In this subsection, \"federal reemployment Act\" means the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994 (38 U.S.C. Section 4301 et seq.), as amended.\n(e) A retired firefighter may be recalled to duty by the chief of the fire department in case of great conflagration and shall perform those duties the chief directs but does not have a claim against a municipality or the fund of that municipality for payment for the duty performed.\n(f)  A member, eligible survivor, or beneficiary who is entitled to receive a benefit payment under this article is entitled to receive the benefit beginning after the date the member ceases to carry out the member's regular duties as a firefighter, notwithstanding the fact that the member may remain on the payroll of the member's fire department or receive sick leave, vacation, or other pay after the effective date of termination of the member's regular duties as a firefighter.  In this article, an authorization to receive a benefit \"beginning after the effective date of the member's termination of active service\" includes authority for the member to instead elect to make the member's pension effective after the date the member ceases to carry out the member's regular duties as a firefighter.  If there is a delay in beginning payment of benefits resulting from the requirements of Section 6(h) of this article for disability pensions, the member or beneficiary shall, when the disability pension is approved by the board, be paid the full amount of the disability pension that has accrued since the effective date of termination of the member's regular duties as a firefighter.\n(g)  A member may designate in a trust document accepted by the fund a trustee to receive the benefit payable to any eligible survivor or beneficiary other than the member's eligible spouse or a spouse eligible to receive a benefit under the DROP.  On or after the death or incapacity of the member, an eligible survivor or beneficiary may designate a trustee under this subsection.  If the eligible survivor or beneficiary is disabled or a minor child, the parent or legal guardian, as applicable, of the eligible survivor or beneficiary may make the designation.  Any designation made under this subsection must be made on a form approved by the board.\n(h) A benefit payable under this article to a minor or another person under a legal disability may be made only to the legal guardian of the person, or as provided by Subsection (g) of this section. A payment made in accordance with this section on behalf of a minor or other person under a legal disability fully discharges the fund's obligation to that person.\n(i) Notwithstanding any other provision of this article, a person entitled to receive benefit payments from the fund may:\n(1)  make a one-time election to receive a smaller pension or survivor benefit than is otherwise provided under this article;\n(2)  make a one-time election not to receive any future annual increases in the pension or survivor benefits received by the person or the person's beneficiary;  or\n(3)  make a one-time election not to receive a specific benefit enhancement.\n(j) An election under Subsection (i) of this section must be made in writing and submitted to the board for approval.  On the date the board grants approval of an election under Subsection (i) of this section, the election becomes irrevocable.\n(k) A benefit under this article may not be integrated with benefits payable under the federal Social Security Act.  In a municipality in which firefighters are eligible to enroll for or receive retirement benefits under the Social Security Act, benefits that may be available to a member under the Social Security Act may not be taken into account in determining the amount of benefits a member may receive under this article.\n(l) If the board determines that the amount in the fund is insufficient to pay in full any pension or disability benefits, all pension and disability benefits made after the date of the determination shall be reduced pro rata for the period the insufficiency exists.\n(m)  A benefit payable under this article because of the death of a member or eligible beneficiary may not be paid to a person convicted of causing that death but instead shall be paid as if the convicted person predeceased the deceased member or beneficiary.   Except as otherwise permitted by this subsection with respect to suspension of benefits, the board is not required to withhold payment to a person convicted of causing the death of a member or eligible beneficiary until the board receives actual notice of the conviction of that person.  The board may suspend payment of a benefit payable on the death of a member or an eligible beneficiary on the indictment of the person who would otherwise be entitled to the benefit, and the suspension remains in effect until the board determines that a final disposition of the charges relating to the cause of death has occurred.  If a benefit payment is suspended under this subsection and the person is not convicted, the benefit again becomes payable with interest computed at the rate earned by the fund during the time the benefit payment was suspended.  For purposes of this subsection, a person has been convicted of causing the death of a member or eligible beneficiary if:\n(1)  the person has pleaded guilty or nolo contendere to, or the person has been found guilty by a court of competent jurisdiction of, an offense at the trial of which it is established that the person's intentional or knowing act or omission caused the death of the member or eligible beneficiary, regardless of whether sentence is imposed or probated; and\n(2)  an appeal of the conviction is not pending, and the time provided for appeal has expired.\n(n) If one or more persons have been given a power of attorney effective to direct distribution of benefits to any person eligible to receive benefits under this article and the fund receives conflicting directions as to those distributions, the fund may withhold benefits until either the final result of judicial proceedings determining which directive prevails or the fund receives a signed agreement between attorneys-in-fact, and principals, if applicable, on distribution directives that completely resolves the conflict.  The fund may not be made a party to any proceeding or suit concerning or involving the distribution of benefits under conflicting directives.\n(o) The fund may offset amounts received wrongly or in error from the fund by any person receiving benefit payments under this article by making deductions from future benefit payments otherwise payable to the person or the person's beneficiaries.  Deductions from future payments for an overpayment may be made only for an overpayment made during the three years preceding the date the board discovers or discovered the overpayment.  The board may not recover an overpayment from a recipient if the overpayment was made more than three years before the date the board discovers or discovered the error.

During the period prescribed by this subsection, the independent actuary may discuss recommendations in simultaneous consultation with the fund actuary and the municipal actuary.\n(l)  The fund and the municipality may not seek any information from any prospective independent actuary about possible outcomes of the independent actuary's review.\n(m)  If an independent actuary has questions or concerns regarding an engagement entered into under this section, the independent actuary shall simultaneously consult with both the municipal actuary and the fund actuary regarding the questions or concerns.  This subsection does not limit the fund's authorization to take appropriate steps to complete the engagement of the independent actuary on terms acceptable to both the fund and the municipality or to enter into a confidentiality agreement with the independent actuary, if needed.\n(n)  If the board does not adopt an assumption or method recommended by the municipal actuary to which the independent actuary agrees, or recommended by the fund actuary, the municipal actuary is authorized to use that recommended assumption or method in connection with preparation of a subsequent risk sharing valuation study under Section 13B of this article until the next actuarial experience study is conducted.\nSec. 13E.  MUNICIPAL CONTRIBUTION RATE WHEN ESTIMATED MUNICIPAL CONTRIBUTION RATE LOWER THAN CORRIDOR MIDPOINT; AUTHORIZATION FOR CERTAIN ADJUSTMENTS.

INTERNAL REVENUE CODE LIMITATIONS.    (a)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this article, a member may not accrue a benefit or allowance under this article in excess of an amount that, when added to all other pension benefits received under plans of the municipality that are qualified under Section 401 of the code, results in an annual benefit in excess of the applicable limits provided by Section 415 of the code.  That accrual limitation applies only as long as satisfaction of Section 415 of the code is necessary to maintain the tax-qualified status of the fund under Section 401 of the code.  Any benefit accruals limited under this subsection must be determined by a qualified actuary selected by the board.\n(b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this article, the fund shall be administered in a manner that complies with the code, United States Treasury Department regulations, and Internal Revenue Service rulings and notices applicable to public retirement systems.

Payments made under Subsection (i) of this section constitute a complete discharge of the pension system's liability and obligation to the person on behalf of whom payment is made.\nSec. 7. REMOVAL OF BOARD MEMBER.    (a)  An elected board member may be removed from the board either by a vote of the membership of the pension system at a removal election initiated and held as provided by this section or by a vote of five board members together with a decision to remove the board member made by a hearing examiner as provided by this section.\n(b) An appointed member of the board may be removed from the board by the administrative head of the city.\n(c) To initiate an election for removal of an elected board member, a petition for removal signed by at least one-third of the members and retired members of the pension system must be filed with the board not later than the 45th day after the date the first signature on the petition is obtained.  Each signature must be legible and accompanied by the signer's printed name and employee payroll number, if any.  A member's payroll number may not be publicly disclosed.  A removal election must be held not later than the 30th day after the date the board certifies that a petition for removal satisfies the requirements for a petition under this subsection.  The results of a removal election are binding only if a majority of the active and retired members participate in the election.  A board member's service on the board ends on the declaration by the board that a majority of those voting in the removal election voted in favor of removal.\n(d) On the date the board makes a declaration under Subsection (c) of this section, the board shall call a special election to be held not earlier than the 20th or later than the 60th day after that date to fill the vacancy for the unexpired term of the person who was removed.  The person who was removed is not eligible to run in the special election but is eligible to run in all subsequent board elections.\n(e) Except as otherwise provided by Subsections (a) and (b) of this section, a board member may be removed only as provided by this subsection and Subsections (f) and (g) of this section.  After an affirmative vote of the board to remove a board member under Subsection (a) of this section, the board or its designee and the board member whose removal is proposed shall attempt to agree on the selection of an impartial hearing examiner.  If the parties do not agree on the selection of a hearing examiner not later than the 10th day after the date the board votes to remove the board member, on the next workday the parties involved shall request a list of seven qualified neutral arbitrators from the American Arbitration Association of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service or another arbitration organization with similarly stringent standards.  The board member whose removal is proposed and the board or their designees may agree on one of the seven neutral arbitrators on the list.  If the parties fail to agree before the 26th day after the date the board first votes to remove the board member, each party or the party's designee shall alternate striking a name from the list, and the name remaining is the hearing examiner.  The board member whose removal is proposed or the board member's designee is entitled to strike the first name.  If the 25th day falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, the parties must strike names from the list on the next workday.  The parties or their designees must agree on a date for the hearing that is within the period prescribed by Subsection (f) of this section.\n(f) The hearing must begin as soon as the hearing examiner can be scheduled but not later than the 60th day after the date the board votes to remove the board member.

Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, in an expedited procedure, the hearing examiner must issue a decision not later than the 10th day after the date the hearing ends.  Unless operating under an expedited hearing procedure, the hearing examiner shall make a reasonable effort to issue a decision not later than the 30th day after the date the hearing ends.  The hearing examiner's inability to meet the time requirements imposed by this subsection does not affect the hearing examiner's jurisdiction or final decision.  The final decision of the hearing examiner may be either to remove the board member or not to remove the board member from the board. The hearing examiner's fees and expenses shall be paid by the pension system.  The costs of a witness shall be paid by the party who calls the witness.\n(g) If the hearing examiner's decision is to remove a board member, the person removed is entitled to an opportunity to have the hearing examiner's decision reviewed.  To have the decision reviewed, not later than the 30th day after the date of a decision under Subsection (f) of this section, the person removed must obtain signatures of at least one-third of the active and retired members of the pension system requesting an election to overrule the removal decision under Subsection (f).  If the 30th day is a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, the following workday is considered the 30th day.  Each signature must indicate the signing date beside the signature, be legible, and be accompanied by the signer's printed name and employee payroll number, if any.  A member's payroll number may not be publicly disclosed.  The board shall verify the list not later than the 10th day after the date the board receives it.  Not later than the 30th day after the date the board has verified the signatures, the board shall hold an election among the active and retired members.  If a majority of the votes cast at an election in which a majority of the active and retired members of the pension system participate favor overruling the hearing examiner's decision, the board member shall be reinstated.  If a majority do not vote to overrule the decision to remove a board member, a replacement election must be held not later than the 30th day after the date of the preceding election.\n(h) During the period beginning on the date of the board vote to remove a board member and ending on the date the board member is reinstated under this section, the person's privileges as a board member, including voting privileges, are suspended.\nSec. 8.

An initial risk sharing valuation study must:\n(1)  except as otherwise provided by this section, be prepared in accordance with Section 9A of this article and, for purposes of Section 9A(a)(4) of this article, be based on actuarial data as of June 30, 2016, or, if actuarial data is not provided, on estimates of actuarial data; and\n(2)  project the corridor midpoint for 31 fiscal years beginning with the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2017.\n(b)  If the initial risk sharing valuation study has not been prepared consistent with this section before the year 2017 effective date, as soon as practicable after the year 2017 effective date:\n(1)  the pension system shall provide to the city actuary, under a confidentiality agreement, the necessary actuarial data used by the pension system actuary to prepare the proposed initial risk sharing valuation study; and\n(2)  not later than the 30th day after the date the city's actuary receives the actuarial data:\n(A)  the city actuary, at the direction of the city, shall provide a proposed initial risk sharing valuation study to the pension system actuary; and\n(B)  the pension system actuary, at the direction of the pension system, shall provide a proposed initial risk sharing valuation study to the city actuary.\n(c)  If, after exchanging proposed initial risk sharing valuation studies under Subsection (b)(2) of this section, it is determined that the difference between the estimated city contribution rate for any fiscal year recommended in the proposed initial risk sharing valuation study prepared by the pension system actuary and in the proposed initial risk sharing valuation study prepared by the city actuary is:\n(1)  less than or equal to two percentage points, the estimated city contribution rate for that fiscal year recommended by the pension system actuary will be the estimated city contribution rate for purposes of Section 9A(a)(5) of this article; or\n(2)  greater than two percentage points, the city actuary and the pension system actuary shall have 20 business days to reconcile the difference and:\n(A)  if, as a result of reconciliation efforts under this subdivision, the difference in any fiscal year is reduced to less than or equal to two percentage points, the estimated city contribution rate recommended by the pension system actuary for that fiscal year will be the estimated city contribution rate for purposes of Section 9A(a)(5) of this article; or\n(B)  if, after 20 business days, the city actuary and the pension system actuary are not able to reach a reconciliation that reduces the difference to an amount less than or equal to two percentage points for any fiscal year:\n(i)  the city actuary at the direction of the city and the pension system actuary at the direction of the pension system each shall deliver to the finance director of the city and the executive director of the pension system a final initial risk sharing valuation study with any agreed-to changes, marked as the final initial risk sharing valuation study for each actuary; and\n(ii)  the finance director and the executive director shall execute a joint addendum to the final initial risk sharing valuation study that is a part of each final initial risk sharing valuation study for all purposes and that reflects the arithmetic average of the estimated city contribution rate for each fiscal year in which the difference was greater than two percentage points for purposes of Section 9A(a)(5) of this article, and for reporting purposes the pension system may treat the pension system actuary's initial risk sharing valuation study with the addendum as the final initial risk sharing valuation study.\n(d)  In preparing the initial risk sharing valuation study, the city actuary and pension system actuary shall:\n(1)  adjust the actuarial value of assets to be equal to the market value of assets as of July 1, 2016;\n(2)  assume the issuance of planned pension obligation bonds by December 31, 2017, in accordance with Subsection (j)(2) of this section; and\n(3)  assume benefit and contribution changes contemplated by this article as of the year 2017 effective date.\n(e)  If the city actuary does not prepare an initial risk sharing valuation study for purposes of this section, the pension system actuary's initial risk sharing valuation study will be used as the final risk sharing valuation study for purposes of this article unless the city did not prepare a proposed initial risk sharing valuation study because the pension system actuary did not provide the necessary actuarial data in a timely manner.  If the city did not prepare a proposed initial risk sharing valuation study because the pension system actuary did not provide the necessary actuarial data in a timely manner, the city actuary shall have 60 days to prepare the proposed initial risk sharing valuation study on receipt of the necessary information.\n(f)  If the pension system actuary does not prepare a proposed initial risk sharing valuation study for purposes of this section, the proposed initial risk sharing valuation study prepared by the city actuary will be the final risk sharing valuation study for purposes of this article.\n(g)  The city and the board may agree on a written transition plan for resetting the corridor midpoint:\n(1)  if at any time the funded ratio is equal to or greater than 100 percent; or\n(2)  for any fiscal year after the payoff year of the legacy liability.\n(h)  If the city and the board have not entered into an agreement described by Subsection (g) of this section in a given fiscal year, the corridor midpoint will be the corridor midpoint determined for the 31st fiscal year in the initial risk sharing valuation study prepared in accordance with this section.\n(i)  If the city makes a contribution to the pension system of at least $5 million more than the amount that would be required by Section 9(a) of this article, a liability gain layer with the same remaining amortization period as the legacy liability is created and the corridor midpoint shall be decreased by the amortized amount in each fiscal year covered by the liability gain layer produced divided by the projected pensionable payroll.\n(j)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this article, including Section 9F of this article:\n(1)  if the city fails to deliver the proceeds of pension obligation bonds totaling $750 million on or before March 31, 2018, the board shall:\n(A)  except as provided by Paragraph (B) of this subdivision, immediately rescind, prospectively, any or all benefit changes made effective under S.B.

ACTUARIAL EXPERIENCE STUDIES.  (a)  At least once every four years, the pension system actuary at the direction of the pension system shall conduct an actuarial experience study in accordance with actuarial standards of practice.  The actuarial experience study required by this subsection must be completed not later than September 30 of the year in which the study is required to be conducted.\n(b)  Except as otherwise expressly provided by Sections 9A(a)(6)(A)-(I) of this article, actuarial assumptions and methods used in the preparation of a risk sharing valuation study, other than the initial risk sharing valuation study, shall be based on the results of the most recent actuarial experience study.\n(c)  Not later than the 180th day before the date the board may consider adopting any assumptions and methods for purposes of Section 9A of this article, the pension system shall provide the city actuary with a substantially final draft of the pension system's actuarial experience study, including:\n(1)  all assumptions and methods recommended by the pension system's actuary; and\n(2)  summaries of the reconciled actuarial data used in creation of the actuarial experience study.\n(d)  Not later than the 60th day after the date the city receives the final draft of the pension system's actuarial experience study under Subsection (c) of this section, the city actuary and pension system actuary shall confer and cooperate on reconciling and producing a final actuarial experience study.  During the period prescribed by this subsection, the pension system actuary may modify the recommended assumptions in the draft actuarial experience study to reflect any changes to assumptions and methods to which the pension system actuary and the city actuary agree.\n(e)  At the city actuary's written request, the pension system shall provide additional actuarial data used by the pension system actuary to prepare the draft actuarial experience study, provided that confidential data may only be provided subject to a confidentiality agreement in which the city actuary agrees to comply with the confidentiality provisions of Section 29 of this article.\n(f)  The city actuary at the direction of the city shall provide in writing to the pension system actuary and the pension system:\n(1)  any assumptions and methods recommended by the city actuary that differ from the assumptions and methods recommended by the pension system actuary; and\n(2)  the city actuary's rationale for each method or assumption the actuary recommends and determines to be consistent with standards adopted by the Actuarial Standards Board.\n(g)  Not later than the 30th day after the date the pension system actuary receives the city actuary's written recommended assumptions and methods and rationale under Subsection (f) of this section, the pension system shall provide a written response to the city identifying any assumption or method recommended by the city actuary that the pension system does not accept.  If any assumption or method is not accepted, the pension system shall recommend to the city the names of three independent actuaries for purposes of this section.\n(h)  An actuary may only be recommended, selected, or engaged by the pension system as an independent actuary under this section if the person:\n(1)  is not already engaged by the city, the pension system, or any other fund or pension system authorized under Article 6243e.2(1), Revised Statutes, or Chapter 88 (H.B. 1573), Acts of the 77th Legislature, Regular Session, 2001 (Article 6243h, Vernon's Texas Civil Statutes), to provide actuarial services to the city, the pension system, or another fund or pension system referenced in this subdivision;\n(2)  is a member of the American Academy of Actuaries; and\n(3)  has at least five years of experience as an actuary working with one or more public retirement systems with assets in excess of $1 billion.\n(i)  Not later than the 20th day after the date the city receives the list of three independent actuaries under Subsection (g) of this section, the city shall identify and the pension system shall hire one of the listed independent actuaries on terms acceptable to the city and the pension system to perform a scope of work acceptable to the city and the pension system.  The city and the pension system each shall pay 50 percent of the cost of the independent actuary engaged under this subsection.  The city shall be provided the opportunity to participate in any communications between the independent actuary and the pension system concerning the engagement, engagement terms, or performance of the terms of the engagement.\n(j)  The independent actuary engaged under Subsection (i) of this section shall receive on request from the city or the pension system:\n(1)  the pension system's draft actuarial experience study, including all assumptions and methods recommended by the pension system actuary;\n(2)  summaries of the reconciled actuarial data used to prepare the draft actuarial experience study;\n(3)  the city actuary's specific recommended assumptions and methods together with the city actuary's written rationale for each recommendation;\n(4)  the pension system actuary's written rationale for its recommendations; and\n(5)  if requested by the independent actuary and subject to a confidentiality agreement in which the independent actuary agrees to comply with the confidentiality provisions of this article, additional confidential actuarial data.\n(k)  Not later than the 30th day after the date the independent actuary receives all the requested information under Subsection (j) of this section, the independent actuary shall advise the pension system and the city whether it agrees with either the assumption or method recommended by the city actuary or the corresponding method or assumption recommended by the pension system actuary, together with the independent actuary's rationale for making the determination.  During the period prescribed by this subsection, the independent actuary may discuss recommendations in simultaneous consultation with the pension system actuary and the city actuary.\n(l)  The pension system and the city may not seek any information from any prospective independent actuary about possible outcomes of the independent actuary's review.\n(m)  If an independent actuary has questions or concerns regarding an engagement entered into under this section, the independent actuary shall simultaneously consult with both the city actuary and the pension system actuary regarding the questions or concerns.  This subsection does not limit the pension system's authorization to take appropriate steps to complete the engagement of the independent actuary on terms acceptable to both the pension system and the city or to enter into a confidentiality agreement with the independent actuary, if needed.\n(n)  If the board does not adopt an assumption or method recommended by the city actuary to which the independent actuary agrees, or recommended by the pension system actuary, the city actuary is authorized to use that recommended assumption or method in connection with preparation of a subsequent risk sharing valuation study under Section 9A of this article until the next actuarial experience study is conducted.\nSec. 9D.

Notwithstanding any other law, a member participating in option A or B of the phase-down program whose effective date of entry into DROP is on or before the year 2017 effective date is, on exiting the phase-down program and separating from service, eligible to receive a monthly service pension equal to the amount credited to the member's DROP account under Section 14(d) of this article immediately before the member separated from service.\n(k)  If a member is hired on or after October 9, 2004, the member may elect to receive a partial lump-sum optional payment equal to not more than 20 percent of the actuarial value of the member's accrued pension at retirement.  The lump-sum payment under this subsection shall be actuarially neutral.  Notwithstanding any other law, if a member elects to receive a lump-sum payment under this subsection, the value of the member's monthly service pension shall be reduced actuarially to reflect the lump-sum payment.\n(l)  A member who is receiving workers' compensation payments or who has received workers' compensation and subsequently retires or begins participation in DROP will have the member's pension or DROP benefit, as applicable, calculated on the pay that the member would have received had the member not been receiving workers' compensation benefits.\n(m)  For a member who is promoted or appointed to a position above the rank of captain on or after the year 2017 effective date, the member's monthly service pension and member contributions shall be based on, as determined by the board:\n(1)  the member's pay for the position the member held immediately before being promoted or appointed; or\n(2)  the pay of the highest civil rank for classified police officers for those members who have no prior service with the city, which pay must be calculated based on the three-year average prior to retirement.\nSec. 13. RESUMPTION OF SERVICE AS DEPARTMENT HEAD AFTER RETIREMENT.    (a)  The pension system shall suspend all pension payments to a retired member who has separated from service and is subsequently appointed as the department head of the police department.  The suspension of payments begins on the effective date of the person's appointment.\n(b) Pension benefits based on the person's previous period of service do not accrue during the period of pension payment suspension described by Subsection (a) of this section, but the person again becomes an active member during this period, and contributions of the city and the department head for the subsequent service are payable during the period.  The department head retains credit for all previous service and acquires credit for the subsequent service unless the department head is or becomes a DROP participant.\n(c) Once the department head again separates from service, pension benefits under this article shall resume based on both periods of service.\nSec. 14. DEFERRED RETIREMENT OPTION PLAN.    (a)  In this section \"DROP benefit\" means the total amount credited to a member's notional DROP account, payable as described by this section, plus a monthly retirement pension.\n(b)  An active member who was hired before October 9, 2004, including a member hired before October 9, 2004, who has been reinstated under arbitration, civil service, or a court ruling after that date, and has at least 20 years of service with the police department may file with the pension system an election to participate in DROP and receive a DROP benefit instead of the standard form of pension provided by this article as of the date the active member attained 20 years of service.  The election may be made, under procedures established by the board, by an eligible active member who has attained the required years of service.  A DROP election that is made and accepted by the board may not be revoked.\n(c)  The monthly service pension or death benefits of an active member who is a DROP participant that were accrued under this article as it existed immediately before the year 2017 effective date remain accrued.\n(c-1)  The monthly service pension or death benefits of an active member who becomes a DROP participant on or after the year 2017 effective date will be determined as if the member had separated from service and begun receiving a pension on the effective date of the member's DROP election and the member does not retire but does not accrue additional service credit beginning on the effective date of the member's entry into DROP.\n(c-2)  For a member who exits DROP on or after the year 2017 effective date:\n(1)  any increases in the member's pay that occur on or after the effective date of the member's entry into DROP may not be used in computing the member's monthly service pension; and\n(2)  any cost-of-living adjustments that occur on or after the effective date of the member's entry into DROP and that otherwise would be applicable to the pension will not be made during the time the member participates in DROP.\n(d)  The member's DROP benefit is determined as provided by this subsection and Subsection (e) of this section.  Each month an amount equal to the monthly service pension the active member would have been eligible to receive if the active member had separated from service on the effective date of entry into DROP, less any amount that is intended to help defray the active member's group medical insurance costs as described by Section 12(d) of this article, shall be credited to a notional DROP account for the active member.  In any year in which a 13th payment is made to retired members under Section 12(e) of this article, an amount equal to the amount of the 13th payment that would have been made to the DROP participant if the DROP participant had retired on the date of DROP entry will be credited to the DROP account.\n(e)  As of the end of each month an amount is credited to each active member's notional DROP account at the rate of one-twelfth of a hypothetical earnings rate on amounts in the account.  The hypothetical earnings rate is determined for each calendar year based on the compounded average of the aggregate annual rate of return on investments of the pension system for the five consecutive fiscal years ending June 30 preceding the calendar year to which the earnings rate applies, multiplied by 65 percent.  The hypothetical earnings rate may not be less than 2.5 percent.\n(f)  Repealed by Acts 2017, 85th Leg., R.S., Ch. 320 (S.B. 2190), Sec. 2.32, eff. July 1, 2017.\n(f-1)  If a DROP participant separates from service due to death, the participant's surviving spouse is eligible to receive benefits under Sections 16 and 16A of this article and the surviving spouse may elect to receive the DROP benefit in the form of an additional annuity over the life expectancy of the surviving spouse.\n(g) In lieu of receiving a lump-sum DROP benefit on separation from service, a retired member who has been a DROP participant or, if separation from service was due to the DROP participant's death, the surviving spouse may leave the retired member's DROP account with the pension system, in which case interest will be credited to the DROP account in the manner described by Subsection (e) of this section.\n(h)  Instead of beginning to receive a service pension on separation from service in accordance with Section 12 of this article, a retired member who is a DROP participant may elect to have part or all of the amount that would otherwise be paid as a monthly service pension, less any amount required to pay the retired member's share of group medical insurance costs, credited to a DROP account, in which case the additional amounts will become eligible to be credited with hypothetical earnings in the same manner as the amounts described by Subsection (g) of this section.  On and after the year 2017 effective date, additional amounts may not be credited to a DROP account under this subsection.  Any amounts credited under this subsection before the year 2017 effective date shall remain accrued in a retired member's DROP account.\n(i)  A retired member who has not attained age 70-1/2, whether or not a DROP participant before retirement, may elect to have part or all of an amount equal to the monthly service pension the retired member would otherwise be entitled to receive, less any amount required to pay the retired member's share of group medical insurance costs, credited to a DROP account, in which case the amounts will become eligible to be credited with hypothetical earnings in the same manner as the amounts described by Subsection (g) of this section.  On and after the year 2017 effective date, additional amounts may not be credited to a DROP account under this subsection.  Any amounts credited under this subsection before the year 2017 effective date shall remain accrued in a retired member's DROP account.\n(j) A retired member who is a DROP participant, or a surviving spouse, may elect to receive distribution of the DROP account in a one-time lump-sum payment or in any other form of distribution that is approved by the board and satisfies the requirements of Section 401(a)(9) of the code.\n(k)  If a retired member who is a DROP participant is rehired as an employee of the police department, any pension or DROP distribution that was being paid shall be suspended and the monthly amount described by Subsection (d) of this section will again begin to be credited to the DROP account while the member continues to be an employee.  If the member's DROP account has been completely distributed, a new notional account may not be created and the monthly amount described by Subsection (d) of this section may not be credited to a DROP account on behalf of the member.\n(l)  The maximum number of years an active member may participate in DROP is 20 years.  Except as provided by this subsection, after the DROP participant has reached the maximum number of years of DROP participation prescribed by this subsection, including DROP participants with 20 years or more in DROP on or before the year 2017 effective date, the DROP participant may not receive the monthly service pension that was credited to a notional DROP account but may receive the hypothetical earnings rate stated in Subsection (e) of this section.  Notwithstanding the preceding, a member's DROP account balance before the year 2017 effective date may not be reduced under the preceding provisions of this subsection.\n(m)  Repealed by Acts 2017, 85th Leg., R.S., Ch. 320 (S.B. 2190), Sec. 2.32, eff. July 1, 2017.\nSec. 15. DISABILITY BENEFITS.    (a)  An active member who becomes totally and permanently incapacitated for the performance of the member's duties as a result of a bodily injury received in, or illness caused by, the performance of those duties shall, on presentation to the board of proof of total and permanent incapacity, be retired and shall receive an immediate duty-connected disability pension equal to:\n(1)  for members hired or rehired before October 9, 2004, the greater of 55 percent of the member's final average pay at the time of retirement or the member's accrued service pension; or\n(2)  for members hired or rehired on or after October 9, 2004, the greater of 45 percent of the member's:\n(A)  final average pay at the time of retirement; or\n(B)  accrued service pension.\n(a-1)  If the injury or illness described by Subsection (a) of this section involves a traumatic event that directly causes an immediate cardiovascular condition resulting in a total disability, the member is eligible for a duty-connected disability pension.  A disability pension granted by the board shall be paid to the member for the remainder of the member's life, as long as the incapacity remains, subject to Subsection (e) of this section.  If a member is a DROP participant at the commencement of the member's disability, the member shall have the option of receiving the DROP balance in any manner that is approved by the board and that satisfies the requirements of Section 401(a)(9) of the code and Treasury Regulation Section 1.104-1(b) (26 C.F.R. Section 1.104-1) and is otherwise available to any other member under this article.\n(b)  A member who becomes totally and permanently incapacitated for the performance of the member's duties and is not eligible for either an immediate service pension or a duty-connected disability pension is eligible for an immediate monthly pension computed in the same manner as a service retirement pension but based on final average pay and service accrued to the date of the disability.  The pension under this subsection may not be less than:\n(1)  for members hired before October 9, 2004, including a member who involuntarily separated from service but has been retroactively reinstated under arbitration, civil service, or a court ruling,  27.5 percent of the member's final average pay; or\n(2)  except as provided by Subdivision (1) of this subsection, for members hired or rehired on or after October 9, 2004, 22.5 percent of the member's final average pay.\n(c)  A member hired or rehired before October 9, 2004, who becomes eligible to receive a disability pension after November 23, 1998, is eligible to receive:\n(1)  subject to Subsection (c-1) of this section, a one-time lump-sum payment of $5,000 at the same time the first monthly disability pension payment is made, but only if the member has not previously received a $5,000 payment under this section or Section 12 of this article; and\n(2)  an additional amount each month equal to $150, beginning on the later of the date the pension begins or the date the first monthly payment becomes due after June 18, 2001, and continuing as long as the disability pension continues, to help defray the cost of group medical insurance.\n(c-1)  For any year in which a 13th payment is made to retired members under Section 12(e) of this article, a 13th payment, computed in the same manner and subject to the same conditions, shall also be paid to members who have retired under this section.\n(d)  A person may not receive a disability pension unless the person files with the board an application for a disability pension not later than 180 days after the date of separation from service, at which time the board shall have the person examined, not later than the 90th day after the date the member files the application, by a physician or physicians chosen and compensated by the board.  The physician shall make a report and recommendations to the board regarding the extent of any disability and whether any disability that is diagnosed is a duty-connected disability.  Except as provided by Subsection (j) of this section, a person may not receive a disability pension for an injury received or illness incurred after separation from service.  In accordance with Section 6(g) of this article, the board may, through its presiding officer, issue process, administer oaths, examine witnesses, and compel witnesses to testify as to any matter affecting retirement, disability, or death benefits under any pension plan within the pension system.\n(e)  A retired member who has been retired for disability is subject at all times to reexamination by a physician chosen and compensated by the board and shall submit to further examination as the board may require.  If a retired member refuses to submit to an examination, the board shall order the payments stopped.  If a retired member who has been receiving a disability pension under this section recovers so that in the opinion of the board the retired member is able to perform the usual and customary duties formerly performed for the police department, and the retired member is reinstated or offered reinstatement to the position, or hired by another law enforcement agency to a comparable position, the board shall order the member's disability pension stopped.  A member may apply for a normal pension benefit, if eligible, if the member's disability benefit payments are stopped by the board under this subsection.\n(f) Repealed by Acts 2003, 78th Leg., ch. 1267, Sec. 24.\n(g) For purposes of this section, a member is totally and permanently incapacitated from performing duties if the member is prevented by a physical or mental injury or illness from performing duties in the police department after any reasonable accommodation offered by the police department and this condition is expected to be permanent.\n(h)  Repealed by Acts 2017, 85th Leg., R.S., Ch. 320 (S.B. 2190), Sec. 2.32, eff. July 1, 2017.\n(i)  Effective for payments that become due after April 30, 2000, and instead of the disability benefit provided by Subsection (a) or (b) of this section, a member who suffers a catastrophic injury shall receive a monthly benefit equal to 100 percent of the member's final average pay determined as of the date of retirement, and the member's DROP balance, if any.\n(j)  Repealed by Acts 2017, 85th Leg., R.S., Ch. 320 (S.B. 2190), Sec. 2.32, eff. July 1, 2017.\n(k) A benefit payment that becomes due under this section is effective on the later of the first day the disabled member leaves the payroll of the city or the date the member signs the application for a disability pension.\n(l)  A disability pension may not be paid to a member for any disability if:\n(1)  the disability resulted from an intentionally self-inflicted injury or a chronic illness resulting from:\n(A)  an addiction by the member through a protracted course of non-coerced ingestion of alcohol, narcotics, or prescription drugs not prescribed to the member; or\n(B)  other substance abuse; or\n(2)  except as provided by Subsection (m) of this section, the disability was a result of the member's commission of a felony.\n(m)  The board may waive Subsection (l)(2) of this section if the board determines that facts exist that mitigate denying the member's application for a disability pension.\n(n)  A person who fraudulently applies for or receives a disability pension may be subject to criminal and civil prosecution.\nSec. 16.  RIGHTS OF SURVIVORS.  (a)  For purposes of this article, a marriage is considered to exist only if the couple is lawfully married under the laws of a state, the District of Columbia, a United States territory, or a foreign jurisdiction and the marriage would be recognized as a marriage under the laws of at least one state, possession, or territory of the United States, regardless of domicile.  In the case of a common-law marriage, a marriage declaration must be signed by the member and the member's common-law spouse before a notary public or similar official and recorded in the records of the applicable jurisdiction in which the couple resides at the commencement of the marriage.  In addition, a marriage that is evidenced by a declaration of common-law marriage signed before a notary public or similar official after December 31, 1999, may not be treated as effective earlier than the date on which it was signed before the notary public or similar official.\n(b)  If a retired member dies after becoming eligible for a service or disability pension, the board shall pay an immediate monthly benefit as follows:\n(1)  to the surviving spouse for life, if there is a surviving spouse, a sum equal to the pension that was being received by the retired member at the time of death;\n(2)  to the guardian of any dependent child under 18 years of age or a child with a disability as long as the dependent child complies with the definition of dependent child under Section 2(7) of this article, on behalf of the dependent child, or directly to a dependent child described by Section 2(7)(B) of this article, and if there is no spouse eligible for an allowance, the sum a surviving spouse would have received, to be divided equally among all dependent children if there is more than one dependent child; or\n(3)  to any dependent parents for life if no spouse or dependent child is eligible for an allowance, the sum the spouse would have received, to be divided equally between the two parents if there are two dependent parents.\n(c)  If an active member of the pension system who has not completed 20 years of service in the police department is killed or dies from any cause growing out of or in consequence of any act clearly not in the actual performance of the member's official duty, the member's surviving spouse, dependent child or children, or dependent parent or parents are eligible to receive an immediate benefit.  The benefit is computed in the same manner as a service retirement pension but is based on the deceased member's service and final average pay at the time of death.  The monthly benefit may not be less than:\n(1)  27.5 percent of the member's final average pay for members hired before October 9, 2004, including a member who involuntarily separated from service but has been retroactively reinstated under arbitration, civil service, or a court ruling; or\n(2)  22.5 percent of the member's final average pay for members hired or rehired on or after October 9, 2004.\n(e)  If any active member is killed or dies from any cause growing out of or in consequence of the performance of the member's duty, the member's surviving spouse, dependent child or children, or dependent parent or parents are eligible to receive immediate benefits computed in accordance with Subsection (b) of this section, except that the benefit is equal to 100 percent of the member's final average pay, computed as of the date of death.\n(f)  A surviving spouse who receives a survivor's benefit under this article is eligible to receive an additional amount each month equal to $150, beginning with the later of the date the first payment of the survivor's benefit is due or the date the first monthly payment becomes due after June 18, 2001, and continuing until the end of the month in which the surviving spouse dies.\n(g)  A surviving spouse or dependent who becomes eligible to receive benefits with respect to an active member who was hired or rehired before October 9, 2004, who dies in active service after November 23, 1998, is eligible to receive a one-time lump-sum payment of $5,000 at the time the first monthly pension benefit is paid, if the member has not already received a $5,000 lump-sum payment under Section 12 or 15(c) of this article.  If more than one dependent is eligible to receive a payment under this subsection, the $5,000 shall be divided equally among the eligible dependents.  This payment has no effect on the amount of the surviving spouse's or dependents' monthly pension and may not be paid more than once.\n(h)  The monthly benefits of surviving spouses or dependents provided under this section, except the $150 monthly payments described by Subsection (f) of this section, shall be increased annually at the same time and by the same percentage as the pensions of retired members are increased in accordance with Section 12(c) or 12(c-1) of this article.  Also, for any year in which a 13th payment is made pursuant to Section 12(e) of this article, a 13th payment, computed in the same manner and subject to the same conditions, shall also be made to the survivor who is eligible to receive death benefits at that time if the member would have been entitled to a 13th payment, if living.\n(i)  If a member or individual receiving a survivor's pension dies before monthly payments have been made for at least five years, leaving no person otherwise eligible to receive further monthly payments with respect to the member, the monthly payments shall continue to be made in the same amount as the last monthly payment made to the member or survivor until payments have been made for five years with respect to the member.  The payments shall be made to the spouse of the member, if living, and if no spouse is living, to the natural or adopted children of the member, to be divided equally among the children if the member has more than one child.  If the member has no spouse or children who are living, the benefit may not be paid.  If the member dies after becoming eligible to receive benefits but before payments begin, leaving no survivors eligible for benefits, the amount of each monthly payment over the five-year period shall be the same as the monthly payment the member would have received if the member had taken disability retirement on the date of the member's death and shall be paid to the member's spouse or children in the manner provided by this subsection.  If the member has no spouse or children who are living, then the benefit may not be paid.  The member's estate or a beneficiary who is not a survivor or dependent is not eligible to receive the payment described by Subsection (g) of this section.\n(j)  A benefit payment made in accordance with this section on behalf of a minor or other person under a legal disability fully discharges the pension system's obligation to that person.\n(k)  A retired member or surviving spouse may designate a beneficiary on a form prescribed by the pension system to receive the final monthly payment owed but not received before the member's or surviving spouse's death.\n(l)  The board may at any time require a person receiving death benefits as a disabled child under this article to undergo a medical examination by a physician appointed or selected by the board for that purpose.\nSec. 16A.  BENEFICIARY DESIGNATION FOR DROP.  (a)  Except for the marriage requirement described by Section 16(a) of this article, the provisions of Section 16 of this article pertaining to rights of survivors do not apply to an amount held in a member's DROP account.  A member who participates in DROP may designate a beneficiary in the form and manner prescribed by or on behalf of the board to receive the balance of the member's DROP account in the event of the member's death, as permitted by Section 401(a)(9) of the code and the board's policies.  A member who is married is considered to have designated the member's spouse as the member's beneficiary unless the spouse consents, in a notarized writing delivered to the board, to the designation of another person as beneficiary.  If no designated beneficiary survives the member, the board shall pay the balance of the member's DROP account to the member's beneficiaries in the following order:\n(1)  to the member's spouse;\n(2)  if the member does not have a spouse, to each natural or adopted child of the member, or to the guardian of the child if the child is a minor or has a disability, in equal shares;\n(3)  if the member does not have a spouse or any children, to each surviving parent of the member in equal shares; or\n(4)  if the member has no beneficiaries described by Subdivisions (1), (2), and (3) of this subsection, to the estate of the member.\n(b)  If a member names a spouse as a beneficiary and is subsequently divorced from that spouse, the divorce voids the designation of the divorced spouse as the member's beneficiary.  A designation of a divorced spouse will cause the board to pay any balance remaining in the member's DROP account in the order prescribed by Subsection (a) of this section.\n(c)  The surviving spouse may designate a beneficiary on a form prescribed by the pension system to receive the balance of the DROP account owed but not received before the surviving spouse's death.\n(d)  Payment of the balance of the member's DROP account made in accordance with this section on behalf of a minor or other person under a legal disability fully discharges the pension system's obligation to that person.\nSec. 17. TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT;  REFUNDS;  REEMPLOYMENT.    (a)  When any active member of the pension system separates from service, either voluntarily or involuntarily, before becoming eligible for an immediate service retirement or disability pension, the member ceases to be an active member of the pension system.\n(b)  A member of the pension system who has not completed 20 years of service at the time of separation from service with the police department is eligible for a refund of the total of the contributions the member made to the pension system, plus any amount that was contributed for the member by the city and not applied in accordance with this section to provide the member with 10 years of service.  The refund does not include interest, and neither the city nor the member is eligible for a refund of the contributions the city made on the member's behalf, except as expressly provided by this subsection.  By receiving the refund, the member forfeits any service earned before separation from service, even if it is otherwise nonforfeitable.\n(c) The board shall notify each member of the pension system of the right to a refund as authorized by this section.\n(d)  A member must apply to the board for a refund within one year after the date of separation from service.  Failure to apply for the refund within the one-year period results in a forfeiture of the right to the refund except for an inactive member who is eligible for a pension.  However, the board may reinstate any amount forfeited and allow the refund on application by the former member.\n(e)  Heirs, executors, administrators, personal representatives, or assignees are not eligible to apply for and receive the refund authorized by this section.\n(f) If a person who separates from service and receives a refund is subsequently reemployed as an employee of the police department, the person shall be reinstated as an active member of the pension system.  Prior service of the active member with the police department may not be counted toward a retirement pension unless the member pays to the pension system, not later than the 90th day after the date of a subsequent separation from service, an amount equal to any contributions previously refunded to the member under this section.  Except as provided by Section 18 of this article, a person is not eligible to repay any withdrawn contributions unless the person is reemployed by the police department of the city for which the prior service was performed.\n(g) A member who is contesting an indefinite suspension action may, on application to the board, receive a return of the member's contributions and be separated from service on receipt of the contributions;  otherwise, a suspended member is considered to have a separation from service when a final decision of the arbitrator adverse to the member is rendered.\n(h) Subject to procedures adopted by the board, the pension system shall accept a direct cash transfer of funds from another plan that is an eligible rollover distribution within the meaning of Section 402(f)(2)(A) of the code.  The transfer shall be accepted only for the purpose of repaying contributions the member has previously withdrawn or for other purposes expressly authorized by the board's procedures.\n(i)  Former members reemployed on or after October 9, 2004, or current members who left service after October 9, 2004, if reemployed by the city, may purchase prior service credit at a rate of interest equal to 2.25 percent per year.  Active members hired before October 9, 2004, who have not yet purchased prior service credit or members hired before October 9, 2004, who involuntarily separated from service but have been retroactively reinstated under arbitration, civil service, or a court ruling may purchase prior service credit at a rate of interest equal to 2.75 percent per year.  The board may adopt rules necessary to implement this section.\nSec. 18. EMPLOYMENT BY ANOTHER DEPARTMENT.    (a)  Except as provided by this section:\n(1)  credit may not be allowed to any person for service with any department in the city other than the police department;\n(2)  a person's service will be computed from the date of entry into the service of the police department as a classified police officer until the date of separation from service with the police department; and\n(3)  a member who received service credit for service with any department in the city other than the police department and who is receiving a monthly pension benefit or who began participation in DROP before the year 2017 effective date shall continue to have the service credit apply.\n(b)  Repealed by Acts 2017, 85th Leg., R.S., Ch. 320 (S.B. 2190), Sec. 2.32, eff.

July 1, 2017.\n(d) Classified police officers who were formerly employed by a city as park police, airport police, or marshals, who were involuntarily transferred from another city department to the police department of the city, and who are current active members of the pension system shall have the option to receive credit with the pension system for previous service with another pension system of the city, provided that a person may not receive service credit for both pension systems for the same period of service.\nSec. 19. PERSONS REJOINING OR TRANSFERRED BY CITY;  SERVICE CREDIT;  DOUBLE BENEFITS;  RETURN TO SERVICE.    (a)  An employee of the city who has retired under this article or under former law governing the pension system and is or has been transferred by action of the city to a classified position in a police department included in the pension system again becomes an active member of the pension system as of the effective date of the transfer.\n(b)  A person who rejoins the pension system under this section is eligible to receive service credit for each day of service and work performed by the person in a classified position in the police department, except for any period during which the person is a DROP participant.  The board shall add service earned after the transfer to the prior service the active member accrued in a classified position in the police department.  However, the active member may not receive service credit under this article, except to the extent provided by Section 18, for service performed for the city other than in a classified position in the police department.\n(c) After a transfer described by this section, contributions of the city and the active member become payable as for other active members of the pension system.\n(d)  When a member who has transferred as described by this section subsequently retires, the retired member is eligible for a pension computed on the basis of the combined service described by Subsection (b) of this section, after deducting any period in which the member was suspended from duty without pay, on leave of absence without pay, separated from service, or employed by the city in a capacity other than in a classified position in the police department.\n(e) If a retired member receives both pension benefits from the pension system and a salary from a classified position in the police department that cover the same period, the retired member shall repay to the pension system the pension benefits received during that period.  The board shall withhold payment of pension benefits under this article if it is determined that a retired member is receiving both pension benefits from the fund and a salary from the police department that cover the same period.  On request of the board, the city attorney or a private attorney chosen by the board shall file suit in a court of competent jurisdiction to recover pension benefits owed to the pension system under this subsection.\n(f) This article does not authorize the return to service with a police department or the resumption of active membership in the pension system by a retired member except as specifically provided by Section 13 or 14 of this article or this section.\nSec. 20. DONATIONS.  The pension system may accept gifts and donations, and the gifts and donations shall be added to the fund for the use of the pension system, including, but not limited to, for use for education programs and the related administrative expenses of the programs.\nSec. 21.  DETERMINATION OF BENEFITS; PROVISION OF INFORMATION.  (a)  The board may require any member, survivor, or other person or entity to furnish information the board requires for the determination of benefits under this article.  If a person or entity does not cooperate in the furnishing or obtaining of information required as provided by this section, the board may withhold payment of the pension or other benefits dependent on the information.\n(b)  The city, not later than the 14th day after the date the city receives a request by or on behalf of the board, shall, unless otherwise prohibited by law, supply the pension system with personnel, payroll, and financial records in the city's possession that the pension system determines necessary to provide pension administrative and fiduciary services under this section, to establish beneficiaries' eligibility for any benefit, or to determine a member's credited service or the amount of any benefits, including disability benefits, and such other information the pension system may need, including:\n(1)  information needed to verify service, including the following information:\n(A)  the date a person is sworn in to a position;\n(B)  the days a person is under suspension;\n(C)  the days a person is absent without pay, including the days a person is on maternity leave;\n(D)  the date of a person's termination from employment; and\n(E)  the date of a person's reemployment with the city;\n(2)  medical records;\n(3)  workers' compensation records and pay information;\n(4)  payroll information;\n(5)  information needed to verify whether a member is on military leave; and\n(6)  information regarding phase-down participants, including information related to entry date and phase-down plan.\n(c)  The city shall provide any information that may be reasonably necessary to enable the pension system to comply with administrative services the pension system performs for the city as reasonably necessary to obtain any ruling or determination letter from the Internal Revenue Service.\n(d)  The information provided by the city shall be transmitted to the pension system electronically in a format specified by the pension system, to the extent available to the city, or in writing if so requested on behalf of the pension system.\n(e)  The pension system shall determine each member's credited service and pension benefits on the basis of the personnel and financial records of the city and the records of the pension system.\nSec. 22. LEGAL ADVICE.  The city attorney of the city shall handle all legal matters for the pension system that are referred by the board without additional compensation for the service.  The board may, however, as it considers necessary, employ outside legal counsel to the exclusion of, or to assist, the city attorney and pay reasonable compensation for the service of the additional legal counsel from the fund.\nSec. 23.  MEMBERS IN MILITARY SERVICE.  (a)  A member of the pension system engaged in active service in a uniformed service may not be required to make the monthly payments into the fund and may not lose any previous years' service with the city because of the uniformed service.  The uniformed service shall count as continuous service in the police department if the member returns to the city police department after discharge from the uniformed service as an employee within the period required by the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994 (38 U.S.C. Section 4301 et seq.), as amended, and the uniformed service does not exceed the period for which a person is eligible to have service counted pursuant to that Act.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this article, contributions and benefits shall be paid and qualified service for military service shall be determined in compliance with Section 414(u) of the code.\n(b)  The city is required to make its payments into the fund on behalf of each member while the member is engaged in a uniformed service.  If a member who has less than 10 years of service in the pension system dies directly or indirectly as a result of the uniformed service, and without returning to active service, the spouse, dependent children, dependent parent, or estate of the member is eligible to receive a benefit in the same manner as described by Section 16(c) of this article.\nSec. 24. ACTIONS FOR FUNDS MISAPPLIED.    (a)  The board may recover by civil action from any offending party or from the party's bondsman, if any, any money paid out or obtained from the fund through fraud, misrepresentation, theft, embezzlement, or misapplication and may institute, conduct, and maintain the action in the name of the board for the use and benefit of the fund.\n(b)  Payments due on behalf of a dependent child shall be paid to the dependent child's guardian, if any, or if none to the person with whom the dependent child is living, except that the board may make payments directly to a dependent child in an appropriate case and withhold payments otherwise due on behalf of any person if the board has reason to believe the payments are not being applied on behalf of the person eligible to receive them.  The board may request a court of competent jurisdiction to appoint a person to receive and administer the payments due to any dependent child or person under a disability.\nSec. 25. FEDERAL TAX QUALIFICATION OF FUND.    (a)  The fund described by this article is intended to qualify under Section 401(a) of the code and is for the exclusive benefit of the members and their survivors.  No part of the corpus or income of the fund may ever be used for, or diverted to, any purpose other than the benefit of members and their survivors as provided by this article.\n(b)  A member or survivor of a member of the pension system may not accrue a retirement pension, disability retirement allowance, death benefit allowance, DROP benefit, or any other benefit under this article in excess of the benefit limits applicable to the fund under Section 415 of the code.  The board shall reduce the amount of any benefit that exceeds those limits by the amount of the excess.  If total benefits under this fund and the benefits and contributions to which any member is eligible under any other qualified plans maintained by the city that employs the member would otherwise exceed the applicable limits under Section 415 of the code, the benefits the member would otherwise receive from the fund shall be reduced to the extent necessary to enable the benefits to comply with Section 415.\n(c)  Subject to Subsection (c-1) of this section, any distributee who receives an eligible rollover distribution is eligible to have that distribution transferred directly to another eligible retirement plan of the distributee's choice on providing direction to the pension system regarding that transfer in accordance with procedures established by the board.\n(c-1)  For purposes of Subsection (c) of this section:\n(1)  \"Direct rollover\" means a payment by the plan to the eligible retirement plan specified by the distributee.\n(2)  \"Distributee\" means a member or a member's surviving spouse or non-spouse designated beneficiary or a member's spouse or former spouse who is the alternate payee under a qualified domestic relations order with regard to the interest of the spouse or former spouse.\n(3)  \"Eligible retirement plan\" means:\n(A)  an individual retirement account as defined by Section 408(a) of the code;\n(B)  an individual retirement annuity as defined by Section 408(b) of the code;\n(C)  an annuity plan as described by Section 403(a) of the code;\n(D)  an eligible deferred compensation plan as defined by Section 457(b) of the code that is maintained by an eligible employer as described by Section 457(e)(1)(A) of the code;\n(E)  an annuity contract as described by Section 403(b) of the code;\n(F)  a qualified trust as described by Section 401(a) of the code that accepts the distributee's eligible rollover distribution; and\n(G)  in the case of an eligible rollover distribution, for a designated beneficiary that is not the surviving spouse, a spouse, or a former spouse who is an alternate payee under a qualified domestic relations order, an eligible retirement plan means only an individual retirement account or individual retirement annuity that is established for the purpose of receiving the distribution on behalf of the beneficiary.\n(4)  \"Eligible rollover distribution\" means any distribution of all or any portion of the balance to the credit of the distributee, except that an eligible rollover distribution does not include:\n(A)  any distribution that is one of a series of substantially equal periodic payments, not less frequently than annually, made for life or life expectancy of the distributee or the joint lives or joint life expectancies of the distributee and the distributee's designated beneficiary or for a specified period of 10 years or more;\n(B)  any distribution to the extent the distribution is required under Section 401(a)(9) of the code; or\n(C)  any distribution that is made on hardship of the employee.\n(d)  The annual compensation for each member taken into account for any purpose under this article may not exceed $200,000 for any year for an eligible participant, or for years beginning after 2001 for an ineligible participant, or $150,000 a year before 2001 for an ineligible participant.  These dollar limits shall be adjusted from time to time in accordance with guidelines provided by the United States secretary of the treasury and must comply with Section 401(a)(17) of the code.  For purposes of this subsection, an eligible participant is a person who first became an active member before 1996, and an ineligible participant is a member who is not an eligible participant.\n(e) Accrued benefits under this article become 100 percent nonforfeitable for a member on the date the member has completed 10 years of service.  If the pension system or the fund is terminated or partially terminated, or city contributions to the fund are discontinued completely, there may not be a reversion of funds to the employer.  On complete or partial termination or discontinuance of city contributions, the fund held by the pension system shall be used exclusively for benefits for members and their surviving spouses and dependents, and the members' rights to the benefits, to the extent funded, shall be nonforfeitable if not already nonforfeitable under this subsection.\n(f) Amounts representing forfeited nonvested benefits of terminated members may not be used to increase benefits payable from the fund.\n(g)  Distribution of benefits must begin not later than April 1 of the year following the calendar year during which the member eligible for the benefits becomes 70-1/2 years of age or terminates employment with the employer, whichever is later, and must otherwise conform to Section 401(a)(9) of the code.\n(h)  For purposes of adjusting any benefit due to the limitations prescribed by Section 415 of the code, the following provisions shall apply:\n(1)  the 415(b) limitation with respect to any member who at any time has been a member in any other defined benefit plan as defined in Section 414(j) of the code maintained by the city shall apply as if the total benefits payable under all the defined benefit plans in which the member has been a member were payable from one plan; and\n(2)  the 415(c) limitation with respect to any member who at any time has been a member in any other defined contribution plan as defined in Section 414(i) of the code maintained by the city shall apply as if the total annual additions under all such defined contribution plans in which the member has been a member were payable from one plan.\n(h-1)  For purposes of adjusting any benefit due to the limitations prescribed by Section 415(b) of the code, the following provisions shall apply:\n(1)  before January 1, 1995, a member may not receive an annual benefit that exceeds the limits specified in Section 415(b) of the code, subject to the applicable adjustments in that section;\n(2)  on and after January 1, 1995, a member may not receive an annual benefit that exceeds the dollar amount specified in Section 415(b)(1)(A) of the code, subject to the applicable adjustments in Section 415(b) of the code and subject to any additional limits that may be specified in the pension system;\n(3)  in no event may a member's annual benefit payable under the pension system, including any DROP benefits, in any limitation year be greater than the limit applicable at the annuity starting date, as increased in subsequent years pursuant to Section 415(d) of the code, including regulations adopted under that section; and\n(4)  the \"annual benefit\" means a benefit payable annually in the form of a straight life annuity, with no ancillary benefits, without regard to the benefit attributable to any after-tax employee contributions, unless attributable under Section 415(n) of the code, and to rollover contributions as defined in Section 415(b)(2)(A) of the code.  For purposes of this subdivision, the \"benefit attributable\" shall be determined in accordance with applicable federal regulations.\n(h-2)  For purposes of adjustments to the basic limitation under Section 415(b) of the code in the form of benefits, the following provisions apply:\n(1)  if the benefit under the pension system is other than the form specified in Subsections (h-1)(1)-(3) of this section, including DROP benefits, the benefit shall be adjusted so that it is the equivalent of the annual benefit, using factors prescribed in applicable federal regulations; and\n(2)  if the form of benefit without regard to the automatic benefit increase feature is not a straight life annuity or a qualified joint and survivor annuity, Subdivision (1) of this subsection is applied by either reducing the limit under Section 415(b) of the code applicable at the annuity starting date or adjusting the form of benefit to an actuarially equivalent amount determined by using the assumptions specified in Treasury Regulation Section 1.415(b)-1(c)(2)(ii) that takes into account the additional benefits under the form of benefit as follows:\n(A)  for a benefit paid in a form to which Section 417(e)(3) of the code does not apply, the actuarially equivalent straight life annuity benefit that is the greater of:\n(i)  the annual amount of the straight life annuity, if any, payable to the member under the pension system commencing at the same annuity starting date as the form of benefit to the member or the annual amount of the straight life annuity commencing at the same annuity starting date that has the same actuarial present value as the form of benefit payable to the member, computed using a five percent interest assumption or the applicable statutory interest assumption; and\n(ii)  for years prior to January 1, 2009, the applicable mortality tables described in Treasury Regulation Section 1.417(e)-1(d)(2), and for years after December 31, 2008, the applicable mortality tables described in Section 417(e)(3)(B) of the code; or\n(B)  for a benefit paid in a form to which Section 417(e)(3) of the code applies, the actuarially equivalent straight life annuity benefit that is the greatest of:\n(i)  the annual amount of the straight life annuity commencing at the annuity starting date that has the same actuarial present value as the particular form of benefit payable, computed using the interest rate and mortality table, or tabular factor, specified in the plan for actuarial experience;\n(ii)  the annual amount of the straight life annuity commencing at the annuity starting date that has the same actuarial present value as the particular form of benefit payable, computed using a 5.5 percent interest assumption or the applicable statutory interest assumption, and for years prior to January 1, 2009, the applicable mortality tables for the distribution under Treasury Regulation Section 1.417(e)-1(d)(2), and for years after December 31, 2008, the applicable mortality tables described in Section 417(e)(3)(B) of the code; or\n(iii)  the annual amount of the straight life annuity commencing at the annuity starting date that has the same actuarial present value as the particular form of benefit payable computed using the applicable interest rate for the distribution under Treasury Regulation Section 1.417(e)-1(d)(3) using the rate in effect for the month prior to retirement before January 1, 2017, and using the rate in effect for the first day of the plan year with a one-year stabilization period on and after January 1, 2017, and for years prior to January 1, 2009, the applicable mortality tables for the distribution under Treasury Regulation Section 1.417(e)-1(d)(2), and for years after December 31, 2008, the applicable mortality tables described in Section 417(e)(3)(B) of the code, divided by 1.05.\n(h-3)  The pension system actuary may adjust the limitation under Section 415(b) of the code at the annuity starting date in accordance with Subsections (h-1) and (h-2) of this section.\n(h-4)  The following are benefits for which no adjustment of the limitation in Section 415(b) of the code is required:\n(1)  any ancillary benefit that is not directly related to retirement income benefits;\n(2)  the portion of any joint and survivor annuity that constitutes a qualified joint and survivor annuity; and\n(3)  any other benefit not required under Section 415(b)(2) of the code and regulations adopted under that section to be taken into account for purposes of the limitation of Section 415(b)(1) of the code.\n(h-5)  The following provisions apply to other adjustments of the limitation under Section 415(b) of the code:\n(1)  in the event the member's pension benefits become payable before the member attains 62 years of age, the limit prescribed by this section shall be reduced in accordance with federal regulations adopted under Section 415(b) of the code, so that that limit, as reduced, equals an annual straight life annuity benefit when the retirement income benefit begins, that is equivalent to a $160,000, as adjusted, annual benefit beginning at 62 years of age;\n(2)  in the event the member's benefit is based on at least 15 years of service as a full-time employee of any police or fire department or on 15 years of military service, in accordance with Sections 415(b)(2)(G) and (H) of the code, the adjustments provided for in Subdivision (1) of this section may not apply; and\n(3)  in accordance with Section 415(b)(2)(I) of the code, the reductions provided for in Subdivision (1) of this section may not be applicable to preretirement disability benefits or preretirement death benefits.\n(h-6)  The following provisions of this subsection govern adjustment of the defined benefit dollar limitation for benefits commenced after 65 years of age:\n(1)  if the annuity starting date for the member's benefit is after 65 years of age and the pension system does not have an immediately commencing straight life annuity payable at both 65 years of age and the age of benefit commencement, the defined benefit dollar limitation at the member's annuity starting date is the annual amount of a benefit payable in the form of a straight life annuity commencing at the member's annuity starting date that is the actuarial equivalent of the defined benefit dollar limitation, with actuarial equivalence computed using a five percent interest rate assumption and the applicable mortality table for that annuity starting date as defined in Section 417(e)(3)(B) of the code, expressing the member's age based on completed calendar months as of the annuity starting date;\n(2)  if the annuity starting date for the member's benefit is after age 65, and the pension system has an immediately commencing straight life annuity payable at both 65 years of age and the age of benefit commencement, the defined benefit dollar limitation at the member's annuity starting date is the lesser of the limitation determined under Subdivision (1) of this section and the defined benefit dollar limitation multiplied by the ratio of the annual amount of the adjusted immediately commencing straight life annuity under the pension system at the member's annuity starting date to the annual amount of the adjusted immediately commencing straight life annuity under the pension system at 65 years of age, both determined without applying the limitations of this subsection; and\n(3)  notwithstanding the other requirements of this section:\n(A)  no adjustment shall be made to reflect the probability of a member's death between the annuity starting date and 62 years of age, or between 65 years of age and the annuity starting date, as applicable, if benefits are not forfeited on the death of the member prior to the annuity starting date; and\n(B)  to the extent benefits are forfeited on death before the annuity starting date, the adjustment shall be made, and for this purpose no forfeiture shall be treated as occurring on the member's death if the pension system does not charge members for providing a qualified preretirement survivor annuity, as defined in Section 417(c) of the code, on the member's death.\n(h-7)  For the purpose of Subsection (h-6)(2) of this section, the adjusted immediately commencing straight life annuity under the pension system at the member's annuity starting date is the annual amount of such annuity payable to the member, computed disregarding the member's accruals after 65 years of age but including actuarial adjustments even if those actuarial adjustments are used to offset accruals, and the adjusted immediately commencing straight life annuity under the pension system at 65 years of age is the annual amount of the annuity that would be payable under the pension system to a hypothetical member who is 65 years of age and has the same accrued benefit as the member.\n(h-8)  The maximum pension benefits payable to any member who has completed less than 10 years of participation shall be the amount determined under Subsection (h-1) of this section, as adjusted under Subsection (h-2) or (h-5) of this section, multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of the member's years of participation and the denominator of which is 10.  The limit under Subsection (h-9) of this section concerning the $10,000 limit shall be similarly reduced for any member who has accrued less than 10 years of service, except the fraction shall be determined with respect to years of service instead of years of participation.  The reduction provided by this subsection cannot reduce the maximum benefit below 10 percent of the limit determined without regard to this subsection.  The reduction provided for in this subsection may not be applicable to preretirement disability benefits or preretirement death benefits.\n(h-9)  Notwithstanding Subsection (h-8) of this section, the pension benefit payable with respect to a member shall be deemed not to exceed the limit provided by Section 415 of the code if the benefits payable, with respect to such member under this pension system and under all other qualified defined benefit pension plans to which the city contributes, do not exceed $10,000 for the applicable limitation year and for any prior limitation year and the city has not at any time maintained a qualified defined contribution plan in which the member participated.\n(h-10)  On and after January 1, 1995, for purposes of applying the limits under Section 415(b) of the code to a member's benefit paid in a form to which Section 417(e)(3) of the code does not apply, the following provisions apply:\n(1)  a member's applicable limit shall be applied to the member's annual benefit in the member's first limitation year without regard to any cost-of-living adjustments under Section 12 of this article;\n(2)  to the extent that the member's annual benefit equals or exceeds the limit, the member shall no longer be eligible for cost-of-living increases until such time as the benefit plus the accumulated increases are less than the limit; and\n(3)  after the time prescribed by Subdivision (2) of this subsection, in any subsequent limitation year, a member's annual benefit, including any cost-of-living increases under Section 12 of this article, shall be tested under the applicable benefit limit, including any adjustment under Section 415(d) of the code to the dollar limit under Section 415(b)(1)(A) of the code, and the regulations under those sections.\n(h-11)  Any repayment of contributions, including interest on contributions, to the plan with respect to an amount previously refunded on a forfeiture of service credit under the plan or another governmental plan maintained by the pension system may not be taken into account for purposes of Section 415 of the code, in accordance with applicable federal regulations.\n(h-12)  Reduction of benefits or contributions to all plans, where required, shall be accomplished by:\n(1)  first, reducing the member's benefit under any defined benefit plans in which the member participated, with the reduction to be made first with respect to the plan in which the member most recently accrued benefits and then in the priority determined by the pension system and the plan administrator of such other plans; and\n(2)  next, reducing or allocating excess forfeitures for defined contribution plans in which the member participated, with the reduction to be made first with respect to the plan in which the member most recently accrued benefits and then in the priority determined by the pension system and the plan administrator for such other plans.\n(h-13)  Notwithstanding Subsection (h-12) of this section, reductions may be made in a different manner and priority pursuant to the agreement of the pension system and the plan administrator of all other plans covering such member.\n(i) To the extent permitted by law, the board may adjust the benefits of retired members and survivors by increasing any benefit that was reduced because of Section 415 of the code.  If Section 415 of the code is amended to permit the payment of amounts previously precluded under that section, the board may adjust the benefits of retired members or their surviving spouses or dependents, including the restoration of benefits previously denied.  Benefits paid under this subsection are not considered as extra base salary earned after retirement but as the delayed payment of benefits earned before retirement.\n(j) The board may make any change in this article to the extent that the change is necessary to assure compliance with the qualification requirements of Section 401 of the code or any other federal law.\nSec. 26. EXCESS BENEFIT PLAN.    (a)  A separate, nonqualified, unfunded excess benefit plan is created outside the fund.\n(b) In this section:\n(1)  \"Excess benefit plan\" or \"plan\" means the separate, nonqualified, unfunded excess benefit plan created by this section for the benefit of eligible members, as amended or restated from time to time, that is intended to be a \"qualified governmental excess benefit arrangement\" within the meaning of Section 415(m) of the code.\n(2)  \"Qualified plan\" means the pension system and any other plan maintained by the city for the exclusive benefit of some or all of the members of the pension system that has been found by the Internal Revenue Service to be qualified or has been treated by the city as a qualified plan under Section 401 of the code.\n(3)  \"Maximum benefit\" means the retirement benefit a retired member and the spouse, dependent child, or dependent parent of a retired member or deceased member or retiree are eligible to receive from all qualified plans in any month after giving effect to Section 25(b) of this article and any similar provisions of any other qualified plans designed to conform to Section 415 of the code.\n(4)  \"Excess benefit participant\" means any retired member whose retirement benefits as determined on the basis of all qualified plans without regard to the limitations of Section 25(b) of this article and comparable provisions of other qualified plans would exceed the maximum benefit permitted under Section 415 of the code.\n(5)  \"Unrestricted benefit\" means the monthly retirement benefit a retired member and the spouse, dependent child, or dependent parent of a retired member or deceased member would have received under the terms of all qualified plans except for the restrictions of Section 25(b) of this article and any similar provisions of any other qualified plans designed to conform to Section 415 of the code.\n(c)  An excess benefit participant who is receiving benefits from the pension system is eligible for a monthly benefit under this excess benefit plan in an amount equal to the lesser of:\n(1)  the member's unrestricted benefit less the maximum benefit; or\n(2)  the amount by which the member's monthly benefit from the fund has been reduced because of the limitations of Section 415 of the code.\n(d)  If a spouse, dependent child, or dependent parent is eligible for preretirement or postretirement death benefits under a qualified plan after the death of an excess benefit participant, the surviving spouse, dependent child, or dependent parent is eligible for a monthly benefit under the excess benefit plan equal to the benefit determined in accordance with this article without regard to the limitations under Section 25(b) of this article or Section 415 of the code, less the maximum benefit.\n(e)  Any benefit to which a person is eligible under this section shall be paid at the same time and in the same manner as the benefit would have been paid from the pension system if payment of the benefit from the pension system had not been precluded by Section 25(b) of this article.  An excess benefit participant or any beneficiary may not, under any circumstances, elect to defer the receipt of all or any part of a payment due under this section.\n(f) The board shall administer the plan, and the board's designee shall also carry out the business of the board with respect to the plan.  Except as otherwise provided by this section, the rights, duties, and responsibilities of the board and the board's designee are the same for the plan as for the funds of the pension system.\n(g) The consultants, independent auditors, attorneys, and actuaries selected to perform services for the fund also shall perform services for the plan, but the fees for their services may not be paid by the fund.  The actuary engaged to perform services for the fund shall advise the board of the amount of benefits that may not be provided from the fund solely by reason of the limitations of Section 415 of the code and the amount of employer contributions that will be made to the plan rather than to the fund.\n(h) Contributions may not be accumulated under the plan to pay future retirement benefits.  Instead, each payment of city contributions that would otherwise be made to the fund under Section 9 of this article shall be reduced by the amount determined by the board or its designee as necessary to meet the requirements for retirement benefits under the plan, including reasonable administrative expenses, until the next payment of city contributions is expected to be made to the pension system.  The city shall then pay to the plan, from the withheld contributions, not earlier than the 30th day before the date each distribution of monthly retirement benefits is required to be made from the plan, the amount necessary to satisfy the obligation to pay monthly retirement benefits from the plan.  The board or its designee shall satisfy the obligation of the plan to pay retirement benefits from the employer contributions so transferred for that month.\n(i) Employer contributions otherwise required to be made to the pension system under Section 9 of this article and any other qualified plan shall be divided into those contributions required to pay retirement benefits under this section and those contributions paid into and accumulated to pay the maximum benefits permitted under the qualified plan.  Employer contributions made to provide retirement benefits under this section may not be commingled with the money of the fund forming part of the pension system or any other qualified plan.\nSec. 27.  CERTAIN WRITTEN AGREEMENTS BETWEEN PENSION SYSTEM AND CITY AUTHORIZED.  (a)  Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, the board or a designee of the board is responsible for representing the interests of the pension system and all pension issues and benefits affecting the pension system or its members and beneficiaries under this article.

If the member is reemployed by the city in a position covered by the pension system before the first anniversary of the date of separation, all credit for previous service is restored.  Any member whose service credit is canceled under this subsection and who is reemployed by the city in a position covered by the pension system after the first anniversary of the date of separation receives one year of previous service credit in group B or group D, as applicable, for each full year of subsequent service up to the amount of the previous service that was canceled.\n(g-1)  On or after the year 2017 effective date, if a group B or group D member who has made required member contributions separates from service before completing five years of credited service, the member's service credit is canceled at the time of separation and the member is eligible to receive a refund of required member contributions as provided by Section 17 of this Act.  If the member is reemployed before the first anniversary of the date of separation:\n(1)  subject to Subdivision (2) of this subsection, all credit for previous service for which no member contributions were required is restored, along with credit for previous service for which the member did not receive a refund of contributions; and\n(2)  if the member's service credit is canceled under this subsection, the member is eligible to reinstate the canceled credited service by paying the pension system the refund amount, if any, plus interest on those amounts at the current assumed rate of return per year, not compounded, from the date contributions were refunded to the date of repayment of those contributions to the pension fund.\n(g-2)  For purposes of Subsection (g-1)(2) of this section, for any canceled service for which contributions were not required, the member receives one year of previous service credit in group B or group D, as appropriate, for each full year of subsequent service up to the amount of the previous service that was canceled.\n(h)  A group B member who was a group A member before September 1, 1981, and who was eligible to purchase credit for previous service under Chapter 358, Acts of the 48th Legislature, Regular Session, 1943 (Article 6243g, Vernon's Texas Civil Statutes), may purchase the service credit in group B by paying into the pension fund an amount equal to the assumed rate of return per year, not compounded, on any contributions previously withdrawn for the period from the date of withdrawal to the date of purchase.\n(i)  Under rules and procedures adopted by the pension board, a group D member may effectuate a direct trustee-to-trustee transfer from a qualifying code Section 457(b) plan to the pension system to purchase an increased or enhanced benefit in accordance with the provisions of code Sections 415(n) and 457(e)(17) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.  The amount transferred under this subsection shall be held by the pension system and the pension system may not separately account for the amount.  The pension board by rule shall determine the additional benefit that a member is entitled to based on a transfer under this subsection.\n(j)  For purposes of this subsection and Subsection (k) of this section, \"furlough time\" means the number of days a person has been furloughed.  A person who has been voluntarily or involuntarily furloughed shall receive credited service for each day that the person has been furloughed, provided that:\n(1)  the pension system receives all required city contributions and member contributions for the credited service attributable to the furlough time for the pay period in which the furlough occurs, based on the regular salary that each furloughed member would have received if the member had worked during the furlough time;\n(2)  the member may receive not more than 10 days of credited service in a fiscal year for furlough time; and\n(3)  credited service for furlough time may not be used to meet the five-year requirement under Section 10(b) of this Act for eligibility for a benefit.\n(k)  For purposes of Subsection (j) of this section, the city shall establish a unique pay code for furlough time to provide for timely payment of city contributions and member contributions for furlough time and to allow the pension system to identify furlough time for each furloughed employee.\n(l)  Notwithstanding any provision of this section, the interest rate on any service purchase shall be the then current assumed rate of return, not compounded.\nSec. 8.  MEMBER CONTRIBUTIONS.  (a)  Subject to adjustments authorized under Section 8E or 8F of this Act, beginning on the year 2017 effective date, each member of the pension system shall make biweekly contributions during employment in an amount determined in accordance with this section.  The contributions shall be deducted by the employer from the salary of each member and paid to the pension system for deposit in the pension fund.  Member contributions under this section shall be made as follows:\n(1)  each group A member shall contribute:\n(A)  seven percent of the member's salary beginning with the member's first full biweekly pay period that occurs on or after the year 2017 effective date; and\n(B)  a total of eight percent of the member's salary beginning with the member's first full biweekly pay period for the member that occurs on or after July 1, 2018;\n(2)  each group B member shall contribute:\n(A)  two percent of the member's salary beginning with the member's first full biweekly pay period that occurs on or after the year 2017 effective date; and\n(B)  a total of four percent of the member's salary beginning with the member's first full biweekly pay period for the member that occurs on or after July 1, 2018; and\n(3)  each group D member shall contribute two percent of the member's salary beginning with the member's first full biweekly pay period that occurs on or after the year 2017 effective date.\n(b)  This section does not increase or decrease the contribution obligation of any member that arose before the year 2017 effective date or give rise to any claim for a refund for any contributions made before that date.\n(c)  The employer shall pick up the contributions required of members by Subsection (a) of this section and contributions required of group D members under Section 10A(a) of this Act as soon as reasonably practicable under applicable rules for all salaries earned by members after the year 2017 effective date and by January 1, 2018, for contributions required by Section 10A(a) of this Act.  The city shall pay the pickup contributions to the pension system from the same source of funds that is used for paying salaries to the members.  The pickup contributions are in lieu of contributions by members.  The city may pick up those contributions by a deduction from each member's salary equal to the amount of the member's contributions picked up by the city.  Members may not choose to receive the contributed amounts directly instead of having the contributed amounts paid by the city to the pension system.  An accounting of member contributions picked up by the employer shall be maintained, and the contributions shall be treated for all other purposes as if the amount were a part of the member's salary and had been deducted under this section.  Contributions picked up under this subsection shall be treated as employer contributions in determining tax treatment of the amounts under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.\n(d)  Repealed by Acts 2017, 85th Leg., R.S., Ch. 320 (S.B. 2190), Sec. 3.24, eff.

or\n(2)  greater than two percentage points, the city actuary and the pension system actuary shall have 20 business days to reconcile the difference, provided that without the mutual agreement of both actuaries, the difference in the estimated city contribution rate recommended by the city actuary and the estimated city contribution rate recommended by the pension system actuary may not be further increased and:\n(A)  if, as a result of reconciliation efforts under this subdivision, the difference is reduced to less than or equal to two percentage points:\n(i)  the estimated city contribution rate proposed under the reconciliation by the pension system actuary will be the estimated city contribution rate for purposes of Subsection (a)(5) of this section; and\n(ii)  the pension system's risk sharing valuation study is considered to be the final risk sharing valuation study for the fiscal year for the purposes of this Act; or\n(B)  if, after 20 business days, the pension system actuary and the city actuary are not able to reach a reconciliation that reduces the difference to an amount less than or equal to two percentage points:\n(i)  the city actuary at the direction of the city and the pension system actuary at the direction of the pension system each shall deliver to the finance director of the city and the executive director of the pension system a final risk sharing valuation study with any agreed-to changes, marked as the final risk sharing valuation study for each actuary; and\n(ii)  not later than the 90th day before the first day of the next fiscal year, the finance director and the executive director shall execute a joint addendum to the final risk sharing valuation study received under Subparagraph (i) of this paragraph that is a part of the final risk sharing valuation study for the fiscal year for all purposes and reflects the arithmetic average of the estimated city contribution rates for the fiscal year stated by the city actuary and the pension system actuary in the final risk sharing valuation study for purposes of Subsection (a)(5) of this section, and for reporting purposes the pension system may treat the pension system actuary's risk sharing valuation study with the addendum as the final risk sharing valuation study.\n(g)  The assumptions and methods used and the types of actuarial data and financial information used to prepare the initial risk sharing valuation study under Section 8C of this Act shall be used to prepare each subsequent risk sharing valuation study under this section, unless changed based on the actuarial experience study conducted under Section 8D of this Act.\n(h)  The actuarial data provided under Subsection (a)(4) of this section may not include the identifying information of individual members.\nSec. 8C.  INITIAL RISK SHARING VALUATION STUDIES; CORRIDOR MIDPOINT AND CITY CONTRIBUTION AMOUNTS.  (a)  The pension system and the city shall separately cause their respective actuaries to prepare an initial risk sharing valuation study that is dated as of July 1, 2016, in accordance with this section.  An initial risk sharing valuation study must:\n(1)  except as otherwise provided by this section, be prepared in accordance with Section 8B of this Act, and for purposes of Section 8B(a)(4) of this Act, be based on actuarial data as of June 30, 2016, or, if actuarial data is not provided, on estimates of actuarial data;\n(2)  project the corridor midpoint for 31 fiscal years beginning with the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2017; and\n(3)  subject to Subsections (i) and (j) of this section, include a schedule of city contribution amounts for 30 fiscal years beginning with the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2017.\n(b)  If the initial risk sharing valuation study has not been prepared consistent with this section before the year 2017 effective date, as soon as practicable after the year 2017 effective date:\n(1)  the pension system shall provide to the city actuary under a confidentiality agreement the necessary actuarial data used by the pension system actuary to prepare the proposed initial risk sharing valuation study; and\n(2)  not later than the 30th day after the date the city's actuary receives the actuarial data:\n(A)  the city actuary, at the direction of the city, shall provide a proposed initial risk sharing valuation study to the pension system actuary; and\n(B)  the pension system actuary, at the direction of the pension system, shall provide a proposed initial risk sharing valuation study to the city actuary.\n(c)  If, after exchanging proposed initial risk sharing valuation studies under Subsection (b)(2) of this section, it is determined that the difference between the estimated total city contribution divided by the pensionable payroll for any fiscal year in the proposed initial risk sharing valuation study prepared by the pension system actuary and in the proposed initial risk sharing valuation study prepared by the city actuary is:\n(1)  less than or equal to two percentage points, the estimated city contribution rate and the estimated city contribution amount for that fiscal year recommended by the pension system actuary will be the estimated city contribution rate and the estimated city contribution amount, as applicable, for purposes of Section 8B(a)(5) of this Act; or\n(2)  greater than two percentage points, the city actuary and the pension system actuary shall have 20 business days to reconcile the difference and:\n(A)  if, as a result of reconciliation efforts under this subdivision, the difference in any fiscal year is reduced to less than or equal to two percentage points, the city contribution rate and the city contribution amount recommended by the pension system actuary for that fiscal year will be the estimated city contribution rate and the estimated city contribution amount, as applicable, for purposes of Section 8B(a)(5) of this Act; or\n(B)  if, after 20 business days, the city actuary and the pension system actuary are not able to reach a reconciliation that reduces the difference to an amount less than or equal to two percentage points for any fiscal year:\n(i)  the city actuary at the direction of the city and the pension system actuary at the direction of the pension system each shall deliver to the finance director of the city and the executive director of the pension system a final initial risk sharing valuation study with any agreed-to changes, marked as the final initial risk sharing valuation study for each actuary; and\n(ii)  the finance director and the executive director shall execute a joint addendum to the final initial risk sharing valuation study that is a part of each final initial risk sharing valuation study for all purposes and that reflects the arithmetic average of the estimated city contribution rate and the estimated city contribution amount for each fiscal year in which the difference was greater than two percentage points for purposes of Section 8B(a)(5) of this Act, and for reporting purposes the pension system may treat the pension system actuary's initial risk sharing valuation study with the addendum as the final initial risk sharing valuation study.\n(d)  In preparing the initial risk sharing valuation study, the city actuary and pension system actuary shall:\n(1)  adjust the actuarial value of assets to be equal to the market value of assets as of July 1, 2016;\n(2)  assume the issuance of planned pension obligation bonds by December 31, 2017, in accordance with Subsection (j)(2) of this section; and\n(3)  assume benefit and contribution changes under this Act as of the year 2017 effective date.\n(e)  If the city actuary does not prepare an initial risk sharing valuation study for purposes of this section, the pension system actuary's initial risk sharing valuation study will be used as the final risk sharing valuation study for purposes of this Act unless the city did not prepare a proposed initial risk sharing valuation study because the pension system actuary did not provide the necessary actuarial data in a timely manner.  If the city did not prepare a proposed initial risk sharing valuation study because the pension system actuary did not provide the necessary actuarial data in a timely manner, the city actuary shall have 60 days to prepare the proposed initial risk sharing valuation study on receipt of the necessary information.\n(f)  If the pension system actuary does not prepare a proposed initial risk sharing valuation study for purposes of this section, the proposed initial risk sharing valuation study prepared by the city actuary will be the final risk sharing valuation study for purposes of this Act.\n(g)  The city and the pension board may agree on a written transition plan for resetting the corridor midpoint:\n(1)  if at any time the funded ratio is equal to or greater than 100 percent; or\n(2)  for any fiscal year after the payoff year of the legacy liability.\n(h)  If the city and the pension board have not entered into an agreement described by Subsection (g) of this section in a given fiscal year, the corridor midpoint will be the corridor midpoint determined for the 31st fiscal year in the initial risk sharing valuation study prepared in accordance with this section.\n(i)  If the city makes a contribution to the pension system of at least $5 million more than the amount that would be required by Section 8A(a) of this Act, a liability gain layer with the same remaining amortization period as the legacy liability is created.  In each subsequent risk sharing valuation study until the end of that amortization period, the city contribution amount must be decreased by the amortized amount in each fiscal year covered by the liability gain layer.\n(j)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, including Section 8H of this Act:\n(1)  if the city fails to deliver the proceeds of pension obligation bonds totaling $250 million on or before March 31, 2018, the pension board shall have 30 days from March 31, 2018, to rescind, prospectively, any or all benefit changes made effective under S.B. No. 2190, Acts of the 85th Legislature, Regular Session, 2017, as of the year 2017 effective date, or to reestablish the deadline for the delivery of pension obligation bond proceeds, reserving the right to rescind the benefit changes authorized by this subdivision if the bond proceeds are not delivered by the reestablished deadline; and\n(2)  subject to Subsection (k) of this section, if the pension board rescinds benefit changes under Subdivision (1) of this subsection or pension obligation bond proceeds are not delivered on or before December 31, 2017, the initial risk sharing valuation study shall be prepared again and restated without assuming the delivery of the pension obligation bond proceeds, the later delivery of pension obligation bond proceeds, or the rescinded benefit changes, as applicable, including a reamortization of the city contribution amount for the amortization period remaining for the legacy liability, and the resulting city contribution rate and city contribution amount will become effective in the fiscal year following the completion of the restated initial risk sharing valuation study.\n(k)  The restated initial risk sharing valuation study required under Subsection (j)(2) of this section must be completed at least 30 days before the start of the fiscal year:\n(1)  ending June 30, 2019, if the pension board does not reestablish the deadline under Subsection (j)(1) of this section; or\n(2)  immediately following the reestablished deadline, if the pension board reestablishes the deadline under Subsection (j)(1) of this section and the city fails to deliver the pension obligation bond proceeds described by Subsection (j)(1) of this section by the reestablished deadline.\nSec. 8D.  ACTUARIAL EXPERIENCE STUDIES.  (a)  At least once every four years, the pension system actuary, at the direction of the pension system, shall conduct an actuarial experience study in accordance with actuarial standards of practice.  The actuarial experience study required by this subsection must be completed not later than September 30 of the year in which the study is required to be conducted.\n(b)  Except as otherwise expressly provided by Sections 8B(a)(7)(A)-(I) of this Act, actuarial assumptions and methods used in the preparation of a risk sharing valuation study, other than the initial risk sharing valuation study, shall be based on the results of the most recent actuarial experience study.\n(c)  Not later than the 180th day before the date the pension board may consider adopting any assumptions and methods for purposes of Section 8B of this Act, the pension system shall provide the city actuary with a substantially final draft of the pension system's actuarial experience study, including:\n(1)  all assumptions and methods recommended by the pension system actuary; and\n(2)  summaries of the reconciled actuarial data used in creation of the actuarial experience study.\n(d)  Not later than the 60th day after the date the city receives the final draft of the pension system's actuarial experience study under Subsection (c) of this section, the city actuary and pension system actuary may communicate concerning the assumptions and methods used in the actuarial experience study.  During the period prescribed by this subsection, the pension system actuary may modify the recommended assumptions in the draft actuarial experience study to reflect any changes to assumptions and methods to which the pension system actuary and the city actuary agree.\n(e)  At the city actuary's written request, the pension system shall provide additional actuarial data used by the pension system actuary to prepare the draft actuarial experience study, provided that confidential data may only be provided subject to a confidentiality agreement entered into between the pension system and the city actuary.\n(f)  The city actuary, at the direction of the city, shall provide in writing to the pension system actuary and the pension system:\n(1)  any assumptions and methods recommended by the city actuary that differ from the assumptions and methods recommended by the pension system actuary; and\n(2)  the city actuary's rationale for each method or assumption the actuary recommends and determines to be consistent with standards adopted by the Actuarial Standards Board.\n(g)  Not later than the 30th day after the date the pension system actuary receives the city actuary's written recommended assumptions and methods and rationale under Subsection (f) of this section, the pension system shall provide a written response to the city identifying any assumption or method recommended by the city actuary that the pension system does not accept.  If any assumption or method is not accepted, the pension system shall recommend to the city the names of three independent actuaries for purposes of this section.\n(h)  An actuary may only be recommended, selected, or engaged by the pension system as an independent actuary under this section if the person:\n(1)  is not already engaged by the city, the pension system, or any other pension system or fund authorized under Article 6243e.2(1) or 6243g-4, Revised Statutes, to provide actuarial services to the city, the pension system, or another pension system or fund referenced in this subdivision;\n(2)  is a member of the American Academy of Actuaries; and\n(3)  has at least five years of experience as an actuary working with one or more public retirement systems with assets in excess of $1 billion.\n(i)  Not later than the 20th day after the date the city receives the list of three independent actuaries under Subsection (g) of this section, the city shall identify and the pension system shall hire one of the listed independent actuaries on terms acceptable to the city and the pension system to perform a scope of work acceptable to the city and the pension system.  The city and the pension system each shall pay 50 percent of the cost of the independent actuary engaged under this subsection.  The city shall be provided the opportunity to participate in any communications between the independent actuary and the pension system concerning the engagement, engagement terms, or performance of the terms of the engagement.\n(j)  The independent actuary engaged under Subsection (i) of this section shall receive on request from the city or the pension system:\n(1)  the pension system's draft actuarial experience study, including all assumptions and methods recommended by the pension system actuary;\n(2)  summaries of the reconciled actuarial data used to prepare the draft actuarial experience study;\n(3)  the city actuary's specific recommended assumptions and methods together with the city actuary's written rationale for each recommendation;\n(4)  the pension system actuary's written rationale for its recommendations; and\n(5)  if requested by the independent actuary and subject to a confidentiality agreement between the pension system and the independent actuary, additional confidential actuarial data.\n(k)  Not later than the 30th day after the date the independent actuary receives all the requested information under Subsection (j) of this section, the independent actuary shall advise the pension system and the city whether it agrees with the assumption or method recommended by the city actuary or the corresponding method or assumption recommended by the pension system actuary, together with the independent actuary's rationale for making the determination.  During the period prescribed by this subsection, the independent actuary may discuss recommendations in simultaneous consultation with the pension system actuary and the city actuary.\n(l)  The pension system and the city may not seek any information from any prospective independent actuary about possible outcomes of the independent actuary's review.\n(m)  If an independent actuary has questions or concerns regarding an engagement entered into under this section, the independent actuary shall simultaneously consult with both the city actuary and the pension system actuary regarding the questions or concerns.  This subsection does not limit the pension system's authorization to take appropriate steps to complete the engagement of the independent actuary on terms acceptable to both the pension system and the city or to enter into a confidentiality agreement with the independent actuary, if needed.\n(n)  If the pension board does not adopt an assumption or method recommended by the city actuary to which the independent actuary agrees, or recommended by the pension system actuary, the city actuary is authorized to use that recommended assumption or method in connection with preparation of a subsequent risk sharing valuation study under Section 8B of this Act until the risk sharing valuation study following the next actuarial experience study is prepared.\nSec. 8E.  CITY CONTRIBUTION RATE WHEN ESTIMATED CITY CONTRIBUTION RATE LOWER THAN CORRIDOR MIDPOINT; AUTHORIZATION FOR CERTAIN ADJUSTMENTS.  (a)  This section governs the determination of the city contribution rate applicable in a fiscal year if the estimated city contribution rate is lower than the corridor midpoint.\n(b)  If the funded ratio is:\n(1)  less than 90 percent, the city contribution rate for the fiscal year equals the corridor midpoint; or\n(2)  equal to or greater than 90 percent and the city contribution rate is:\n(A)  equal to or greater than the minimum contribution rate, the estimated city contribution rate is the city contribution rate for the fiscal year; or\n(B)  except as provided by Subsection (e) of this section, less than the minimum contribution rate for the corresponding fiscal year, the city contribution rate for the fiscal year equals the minimum contribution rate achieved in accordance with Subsection (c) of this section.\n(c)  For purposes of Subsection (b)(2)(B) of this section, the following adjustments shall be applied sequentially to the extent required to increase the estimated city contribution rate to equal the minimum contribution rate:\n(1)  first, adjust the actuarial value of assets equal to the current market value of assets, if making the adjustment causes the city contribution rate to increase;\n(2)  second, under a written agreement between the city and the pension board under Section 3(n) of this Act entered into not later than the 30th day before the first day of the next fiscal year, prospectively restore all or part of any benefit reductions or reduce increased employee contributions, in each case made after the year 2017 effective date;\n(3)  third, accelerate the payoff year of the legacy liability by offsetting the remaining legacy liability by the amount of the new liability loss layer, provided that during the accelerated period the city will continue to pay the city contribution amount as scheduled in the initial risk sharing valuation study, subject to Section 8C(i) or (j) of this Act;\n(4)  fourth, accelerate the payoff year of existing liability loss layers, excluding the legacy liability, by accelerating the oldest liability loss layers first, to an amortization period of not less than 20 years from the first day of the fiscal year beginning 12 months after the date of the risk sharing valuation study in which the liability loss layer is first recognized; and\n(5)  fifth, under a written agreement between the city and the pension board under Section 3(n) of this Act entered into not later than the 30th day before the first day of the next fiscal year, the city and the pension board may agree to reduce the assumed rate of return.\n(d)  If the funded ratio is:\n(1)  equal to or greater than 100 percent:\n(A)  all existing liability layers, including the legacy liability, are considered fully amortized and paid;\n(B)  the city contribution amount may no longer be included in the city contribution under Section 8A of this Act; and\n(C)  the city and the pension system may mutually agree to change assumptions in a written agreement entered into between the city and the pension board under Section 3(n) of this Act; and\n(2)  greater than 100 percent in a written agreement between the city and the pension system entered into under Section 3(n) of this Act, the pension system may reduce member contributions or increase pension benefits if as a result of the action:\n(A)  the funded ratio is not less than 100 percent; and\n(B)  the city contribution rate is not more than the minimum contribution rate.\n(e)  Except as provided by Subsection (f) of this section, if an agreement under Subsection (d) of this section is not reached on or before the 30th day before the first day of the next fiscal year, before the first day of the next fiscal year, the pension board shall reduce member contributions and implement or increase cost-of-living adjustments, but only to the extent that the city contribution rate is set at or below the minimum contribution rate and the funded ratio is not less than 100 percent.\n(f)  If any member contribution reduction or benefit increase under Subsection (e) of this section has occurred within the previous three fiscal years, the pension board may not make additional adjustments to benefits, and the city contribution rate must be set to equal the minimum contribution rate.\nSec. 8F.

(a)  On and after January 1, 2018, in addition to the group D member contributions under Section 8 of this Act, each group D member shall contribute one percent of the member's salary for each biweekly pay period beginning with the member's first full biweekly pay period after the later of January 1, 2018, or the group D member's first date of employment.  The contribution required by this subsection:\n(1)  shall be picked up and paid in the same manner and at the same time as group D member contributions required under Section 8(a)(3) of this Act, subject to applicable rules;\n(2)  is separate from and in addition to the group D member contribution under Section 8(a)(3) of this Act; and\n(3)  is not subject to reduction or increase under Sections 8A through 8F of this Act or a refund under Section 17 of this Act.\n(b)  For each biweekly pay period of a group D member's service for which the group D member makes the contribution required under Subsection (a) of this section, the following amounts shall be credited to a notional account, known as a cash balance account, for the group D member:\n(1)  the amount of the contributions paid under Subsection (a) of this section for that biweekly pay period; and\n(2)  interest on the balance of the group D member's cash balance account determined by multiplying:\n(A)  an annual rate that is one-half the pension system's five-year investment return based on a rolling five-fiscal-year basis and net of investment expenses, with a minimum annual rate of 2.5 percent and a maximum annual rate of 7.5 percent, and divided by 26; and\n(B)  the amount credited to the group D member's cash balance account as of the end of the biweekly pay period.\n(c)  The pension system may not pay interest on amounts credited to a cash balance account but not received by the pension system under Subsection (b) of this section.\n(d)  On separation from service, a group D member is eligible to receive only a distribution of the contributions credited to that group D member's cash balance account, without interest, if the group D member has attained less than one year of service while contributing to the cash balance account.  If a group D member attains at least one year of service while contributing to the cash balance account, the group D member is fully vested in the accrued benefit represented by that group D member's cash balance account, including interest.\n(e)  In a manner and form prescribed by the pension board, a group D member who terminates employment is eligible to elect to receive the group D member's cash balance account benefit in a lump-sum payment, in substantially equal periodic payments, in a partial lump-sum payment followed by substantially equal periodic payments, or in partial payments from the group D member's cash balance account.\n(f)  Contributions may not be made to a group D member's cash balance account for a period that occurs after the date the group D member terminates employment, except that interest at a rate that is not greater than the rate under Subsection (b)(2) of this section, as determined by the pension board, may be credited based on the former group D member's undistributed cash balance account after the date the group D member terminates employment.\n(g)  On the death of a group D member or former group D member before the full distribution of the member's cash balance account, the deceased member's cash balance account shall be payable in a single lump-sum payment to:\n(1)  the deceased member's surviving spouse;\n(2)  if there is no surviving spouse, each designated beneficiary of the deceased member, designated in the manner and on a form prescribed by the pension board; or\n(3)  if there is no designated beneficiary, the deceased member's estate.\n(h)  The lump-sum payment described by Subsection (g) of this section shall be made within a reasonable time after the pension board has determined that the individual or estate is eligible for the distribution.\n(i)  Subject to the other provisions of this section, the pension board may adopt rules necessary to implement this section, including rules regarding the payment of the cash balance account and limitations on the timing and frequency of payments.  All distributions and changes in the form of distribution must be made in a manner and at a time that complies with the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.\nSec. 11.  OPTION-ELIGIBLE PARTICIPANTS.  (a)  In this section, \"J&S Annuity\" means payment of a normal retirement pension or early retirement pension under one of the options provided by Subsection (b) of this section.\n(a-1)  For purposes of this section, an option-eligible participant is:\n(1)  a former group A or group B member who terminates employment with the city or the pension system on or after June 30, 2011, and who is eligible to receive a normal retirement pension, provided the member was not married as of the date of the member's termination of employment;\n(2)  a former group B member who terminated employment with the city or the predecessor system before September 1, 1997, and who is eligible to receive a normal retirement pension; or\n(3)  a former group D member who terminated employment with the city or the pension system and who is eligible to receive a normal retirement pension or an early retirement pension.\n(a-2)  The pension board, in its sole discretion, shall make determinations regarding an individual's status as an option-eligible participant.\n(a-3)  Before the date an option-eligible participant commences receipt of a benefit, that option-eligible participant must elect, in a manner and at a time determined by the pension board, whether to receive the participant's normal retirement pension or early retirement pension, as applicable, or to have the option-eligible participant's normal retirement pension or early retirement pension, as applicable, paid under one of the options provided by Subsection (b) of this section.  The election may be revoked, in a manner and at a time established by the pension board, not later than the 60th day before the date the participant commences receipt of a benefit.\n(b)  The normal retirement pension or early retirement pension may be one of the following actuarially equivalent amounts:\n(1)  option 1:  a reduced pension payable to the participant, then on the participant's death one-half of the amount of that reduced pension is payable to the participant's designated survivor, for life;\n(2)  option 2:  a reduced pension payable to the participant, then on the participant's death that same reduced pension is payable to the participant's designated survivor, for life; and\n(3)  option 3:  a reduced pension payable to the participant, and if the participant dies within 10 years, the pension is paid to the participant's designated survivor for the remainder of the 10-year period beginning on the participant's benefit commencement date.\n(c)  If an option-eligible participant who has made the election provided by Subsection (b) of this section dies after terminating employment with at least five years of credited service but before attaining the age required to begin receiving a normal or early retirement pension, the person's designated survivor is eligible for the J&S Annuity provided by the option selected by the option-eligible participant at the time of separation from service.  The benefits first become payable to an eligible designated survivor on the date the option-eligible participant would have become eligible to begin receiving a pension.  If the designated survivor elects for earlier payment, in a time and manner determined by the pension board, the actuarial equivalent of that amount shall be payable at that earlier date.\n(d)  A survivor benefit under Subsection (c) of this section or a J&S Annuity is not payable if:\n(1)  except as provided by Subsection (e) of this section, an option-eligible participant does not elect one of the J&S Annuity options under Subsection (b) of this section and dies before retirement has commenced;\n(2)  an option-eligible participant elects a normal retirement pension or early retirement pension and dies before retirement has commenced; or\n(3)  an option-eligible participant dies after retirement has commenced and that option-eligible participant:\n(A)  elected a normal retirement pension or early retirement pension;\n(B)  did not make a valid election under Subsection (b) of this section; or\n(C)  made an election that is void.\n(e)  An option-eligible participant described by Subsection (a-1)(3) of this section who did not elect one of the J&S Annuity options under Subsection (b) of this section is considered to have elected a J&S Annuity option under Subsection (b)(1) of this section and to have designated the participant's surviving spouse as the optional annuitant if the participant:\n(1)  was not in service with the city or the pension system at the time of the participant's death;\n(2)  is survived by a surviving spouse; and\n(3)  dies before the participant's retirement has commenced.\n(f)  If the option-eligible participant described by Subsection (e) of this section has no surviving spouse, a survivor benefit or J&S Annuity is not payable.  If a J&S Annuity is paid under Subsection (e) of this section, a survivor benefit is not payable under this subsection or under Section 14 of this Act.\n(g)  If Subsection (d) of this section would otherwise apply to prohibit the payment of a survivor benefit or J&S Annuity, but there is one or more dependent children of the deceased option-eligible participant, the provisions of Section 14 of this Act control the payment of survivor benefits to the dependent child or children.  The pension system may not pay both a J&S Annuity under this section and a survivor benefit under Section 14 of this Act with respect to any option-eligible participant.  If a J&S Annuity is paid under Subsection (e) of this section, a survivor benefit is not payable.\n(h)  If an option-eligible participant has previously elected a J&S Annuity for a previous period of service, no benefits have been paid under that previous election, and the option-eligible participant terminates employment on or after January 1, 2012, the previous election is void and the option-eligible participant shall make an election under Subsection (b) of this section to apply to all periods of service.\n(i)  If a former group B member with service before September 1, 1997, was rehired in a covered position and converted the group B service covered by a J&S Annuity to group A service, and that member terminates employment on or after January 1, 2012, and is not an option-eligible participant at the time of the member's subsequent termination, the previous election is void and survivor benefits for an eligible survivor, if any, are payable as provided by Section 14 of this Act, provided benefits were not paid under the previous election.\n(j)  If an option-eligible participant who elects a J&S Annuity under this section designates the participant's spouse as a designated survivor and the marriage is later dissolved by divorce, annulment, or a declaration that the marriage is void before the participant's retirement, the designation is void unless the participant reaffirms the designation after the marriage was dissolved.\n(k)  A J&S Annuity payable to a designated survivor of a retired option-eligible participant is effective on the first day of the month following the month of the option-eligible participant's death and ceases on the last day of the month of the designated survivor's death or on the last day of the month in which the survivor otherwise ceases to be eligible to receive a J&S Annuity.\nSec. 12.  DEFERRED RETIREMENT OPTION PLAN.  (a)  In this section:\n(1)  \"DROP\" means the deferred retirement option plan established under Chapter 358, Acts of the 48th Legislature, Regular Session, 1943 (Article 6243g, Vernon's Texas Civil Statutes), and reenacted and continued under this Act.\n(2)  \"DROP account\" means a notional account established for a DROP participant that is used solely as an accounting convention to aid in the computation of the DROP participant's DROP benefit.  The DROP account may only be used for accounting purposes, and there is no actual separation of assets of the pension fund before the distribution of the DROP participant's DROP benefit.\n(3)  \"DROP benefit\" means a DROP participant's total DROP account balance at the time the DROP participant terminates employment.\n(4)  \"DROP election date\" means the date the pension system receives a member's election to participate in the DROP in the manner and form determined by the pension system and approved by the pension board.\n(5)  \"DROP entry date\" means the date a member ceases to earn service credit and begins earning credit for the member's DROP account, which is the later of the date the member is eligible to participate in the DROP, the date requested by the member, or October 1, 1997, as approved by the pension board.  The DROP entry date is the first day of a month and is determined by the normal retirement eligibility requirements of this Act or of Chapter 358, Acts of the 48th Legislature, Regular Session, 1943 (Article 6243g, Vernon's Texas Civil Statutes), as applicable, in effect on the requested DROP entry date.  A member who enters DROP on or after January 1, 2005, may not have a DROP entry date that occurs before the date the pension system receives the member's request to participate in DROP.\n(6)  \"DROP participant\" means a pension system member who is participating in the DROP.\n(b)  A member who is eligible to receive a normal retirement pension under this Act and who is in active service with the city or the pension system, or a person who is eligible to receive a normal retirement pension under this Act and who has been separated from service for less than 30 days and has not otherwise been granted a pension or benefit, may file with the pension system an election to participate in the DROP and receive a DROP benefit under procedures established by the pension board.  An election to participate in the DROP is irrevocable except as provided by Subsection (j) of this section.\n(b-1)  Notwithstanding Subsection (b) of this section, for DROP participation beginning on or after January 1, 2005, a member must meet the normal retirement eligibility requirements under Section 10(b) or (c) of this Act to be eligible to elect to participate in DROP.  This subsection does not apply to a member who:\n(1)  met the eligibility requirements under Section 10(b) of this Act in effect before January 1, 2005; or\n(2)  before January 1, 2005, had at least five years of credited service and a combination of years of age and years of credited service, including parts of years, the sum of which equaled or was greater than 68.\n(c)  A member who is required to make payments to the pension system to purchase service or to convert service is eligible to participate in the DROP only to the extent that the member is eligible to participate in the DROP without regard to the service covered by the payment obligation, but must complete the obligation.  If the payment obligation is not fully met, the member's participation in the DROP is determined as though the payment obligation was not entered into.  A member who is participating in the DROP may not change membership from one group to another group, convert service from one group to another group, purchase service credit, or make a claim to purchase military service.\n(d)  Credited service and normal retirement benefits cease to accrue on the day preceding the member's DROP entry date.  The period of a member's DROP participation, unless revoked as provided by Subsection (j) of this section, begins on the DROP participant's DROP entry date and ends on the date of the DROP participant's last day of active service with the city or the pension system.  On the first day of the month following the month in which the pension board approves the member's DROP election, the DROP election becomes effective and the pension board shall establish a DROP account for the DROP participant.  For each month during the period of DROP participation before a DROP participant's termination of employment, the following amounts shall be credited to the DROP participant's DROP account, including prorated amounts for partial months of service:\n(1)  an amount equal to what would have been the DROP participant's monthly normal retirement benefit if the DROP participant had retired on the DROP participant's DROP entry date, except that the monthly amount shall be computed based on the DROP participant's credited service and average monthly salary as of the DROP entry date and the benefit accrual rates and maximum allowable benefit applicable on the DROP election date, with the cost-of-living adjustments payable under Subsection (s) of this section, if any, that would apply if the DROP participant had retired on the DROP participant's DROP entry date; and\n(2)  subject to Subsection (d-1) of this section,  interest on the DROP participant's DROP account balance computed at a rate determined by the pension board and compounded at intervals designated by the pension board, but at least once in each 13-month period.\n(d-1)  Beginning January 1, 2018, the pension board shall establish the interest rate applicable under Subsection (d)(2) of this section as of January 1 of each year at a rate:\n(1)  except as provided by Subdivision (2) of this subsection, equal to half the pension system's five-year investment return based on a rolling five-fiscal-year basis and net of investment expenses; and\n(2)  that may not be less than 2.5 percent or more than 7.5 percent.\n(e)  The monthly amount credited under Subsection (d)(1) of this section may not include any amount that is intended to help defray an increase in group medical insurance costs as described by Section 15(a) of this Act.  In any year in which a supplemental payment is made to retirees under Section 15(b) of this Act, an amount equal to the amount of the supplemental payment that would have been made to the DROP participant if the DROP participant had retired on the DROP entry date shall be credited to the DROP participant's DROP account.\n(f)  The period for credits to a DROP participant's DROP account includes each month beginning with the DROP participant's DROP entry date through the date the DROP participant terminates employment with the city or the pension system.  Credits may not be made to a DROP participant's DROP account for a period that occurs after the date the DROP participant terminates employment, except that interest at a rate determined by the pension board may be paid on the person's undistributed DROP account balance after the date the person terminates employment.  A DROP participant must pay required contributions to the pension system for all time in DROP that would otherwise constitute service in order to receive allowable credits to the DROP participant's DROP account.\n(g)  A DROP participant who terminates employment is eligible to elect to receive the DROP participant's DROP benefit in a lump sum, in substantially equal periodic payments, in a partial lump sum followed by substantially equal periodic payments, or in partial payments from the participant's DROP account, in a manner and form determined by the pension board.  The pension board may establish procedures concerning partial payments under this subsection, including limitations on the timing and frequency of those payments.  A participant who elects partial payments may elect to receive the participant's entire remaining DROP account balance in a single lump-sum payment.  The pension board shall determine a reasonable time for lump-sum and periodic payments of the DROP benefit.   All distributions and changes in the form of distribution must be made in a manner and at a time that complies with that provision of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.\n(h)  If a DROP participant dies before the full distribution of the DROP participant's DROP account balance, the undistributed DROP account balance shall be distributed to the DROP participant's surviving spouse, if any, in a lump-sum payment within a reasonable time after the pension board has determined that the surviving spouse is eligible for the distribution.  If there is no surviving spouse, each beneficiary of the DROP participant, as designated in the manner and on a form established by the pension board, is eligible to receive the beneficiary's applicable portion of the deceased DROP participant's undistributed DROP account balance in a lump-sum payment within a reasonable time after the pension board has determined that the beneficiary is eligible for the distribution.  If no beneficiary is designated, the undistributed DROP account balance shall be distributed to the deceased participant's estate.\n(i)  A DROP participant is ineligible for disability benefits provided by this Act.\n(j)  An election to participate in the DROP is irrevocable, except that:\n(1)  if a DROP participant is approved for a service disability pension, the DROP participant's DROP election is automatically revoked; and\n(2)  if a DROP participant dies, the surviving spouse, if any, or the beneficiary, if any, may elect to revoke the DROP participant's DROP election, at a time and in a manner determined by the pension board, only if the revocation occurs before a distribution from the DROP participant's DROP account or the payment of a survivor benefit under this Act or Chapter 358, Acts of the 48th Legislature, Regular Session, 1943 (Article 6243g, Vernon's Texas Civil Statutes).\n(k)  On revocation of a DROP election under Subsection (j) of this section, the DROP account balance becomes zero, and a distribution of DROP benefits may not be made to the participant, the participant's surviving spouse, or the participant's beneficiaries.  In the event of revocation, the benefits based on the participant's service are determined as if the participant's DROP election had never occurred.\n(l)  Under a rule adopted by the pension board under this section, the surviving spouse of a deceased member or, if the member has no surviving spouse, the designated beneficiary of the deceased member may make the DROP election that the deceased member would have been eligible to make the day before the member's death and may receive the DROP distribution in a lump sum within a reasonable time after the pension board has determined that the surviving spouse or designated beneficiary is eligible for the distribution.  A DROP election by the surviving spouse or designated beneficiary under this subsection may not be made after the sixth month after the date of the member's death.  An election may not be made under this subsection if a survivor benefit or other distribution has been made with respect to the deceased member.  Notwithstanding any other provision, an election made under this subsection is irrevocable.\n(m)  If an unanticipated actuarial cost occurs in administering the DROP, the pension board, on the advice of the pension system actuary, may take action necessary to mitigate the unanticipated cost, including refusal to accept additional elections to participate in the DROP.  The pension system shall continue to administer the DROP for the DROP participants participating in the DROP before the date of the mitigating action.\n(n)  A former DROP participant who is rehired by the city or the pension system following termination of employment is not eligible to participate in the DROP.\n(o)  Except as provided by Subsection (o-1) of this section, on termination of employment, a DROP participant shall receive a normal retirement pension under Section 10 of this Act or under Section 11, 22A, or 24 of Chapter 358, Acts of the 48th Legislature, Regular Session, 1943 (Article 6243g, Vernon's Texas Civil Statutes), as those sections read on the day preceding the participant's DROP entry date, as applicable, except that the credited service under that section is the member's credited service as of the day before the member's DROP entry date, the benefit accrual rate applicable to the credited service shall be the benefit accrual rate in effect on the member's DROP election date, the maximum allowable benefit shall be the maximum allowable benefit in effect on the member's DROP election date, and the member's average monthly salary is the average monthly salary determined as of the later of the member's DROP entry date or January 1, 2005, as applicable.  The DROP participant's normal retirement pension is increased by any cost-of-living adjustments applied to the monthly credit to the member's DROP account under Subsection (d)(1) of this section during the member's participation in the DROP.  Cost-of-living adjustments applicable to periods after the date of the DROP participant's termination of employment are based on the DROP participant's normal retirement pension computed under this subsection or Subsection (o-1) of this section, as applicable, excluding any cost-of-living adjustments.\n(o-1)  On termination of employment, and before any benefit or DROP payment, a DROP participant who is an option-eligible participant shall make the required election under Section 11 of this Act.  If the option-eligible participant elects a J&S Annuity, the DROP account, including all DROP credits, shall be recalculated from the DROP entry date to termination of employment as provided by Subsection (o) of this section as if the J&S Annuity was selected to be effective as of the DROP entry date.\n(p)  If a DROP election is not revoked under Subsection (j) of this section, the survivor benefit payable to an eligible survivor of a deceased DROP participant under Section 14 of this Act is computed as a percentage of the monthly ordinary disability pension that the member would have been eligible to receive had the member suffered a disability the day before the member's DROP entry date, except that the ordinary disability pension is computed based on the DROP participant's credited service as of the day before the DROP participant's DROP entry date, the benefit accrual rate applicable to the credited service as of the DROP participant's DROP election date, and the DROP participant's average monthly salary as of the later of the DROP participant's DROP entry date or January 1, 2005, as applicable.  A surviving spouse, if any, of a DROP participant who dies from a cause directly resulting from a specific incident in the performance of the DROP participant's duties for the city or the pension system is ineligible to receive enhanced survivor benefits under Section 14(c) of this Act unless the DROP election is revoked under Subsection (j)(2) of this section and the surviving spouse receives a survivor benefit as otherwise provided by this subsection.\n(q)  The pension board may adopt rules for the implementation and operation of the DROP, including rules regarding the payment of DROP benefits.\n(r)  Except as provided by Subsection (s) of this section, the pension system may not credit a DROP account with a cost-of-living adjustment percentage on or after February 1, 2018.\n(s)  On or after February 1, 2018, and for future credit only, the pension system shall credit a cost-of-living adjustment percentage, not compounded, to the DROP account of a DROP participant who was at least 62 years of age as of January 1 of the year in which the increase is made.\n(t)  The pension board may establish deadlines for the submission of any information, document, or other record pertaining to DROP.\nSec. 13.  DISABILITY PENSIONS.  (a)  A member who has completed five or more years of credited service and who becomes disabled is eligible, regardless of age, for an ordinary disability retirement and shall receive a monthly disability pension computed in accordance with Section 10(d) of this Act.\n(b)  A member who is disabled by reason of a personal injury sustained or a hazard undergone as a result of, and while in the performance of, the member's employment duties at some definite place and at some definite time on or after the date of becoming a member, without serious and wilful misconduct on the member's part, is eligible for a service disability retirement and shall receive a monthly disability pension equal to the greater of:\n(1)  the monthly normal retirement pension computed under Section 10(d) of this Act; or\n(2)  20 percent of the member's monthly salary on the date the injury occurred or the hazard was undergone.\n(c)  In addition to the monthly disability pension under Subsection (b)(2) of this section, a group A member shall receive one percent of the salary under Subsection (b)(2) of this section for each year of credited service.  The total disability pension computed under Subsection (b)(2) of this section may not exceed the greater of:\n(1)  40 percent of that monthly salary; or\n(2)  the monthly normal retirement pension computed in accordance with Section 10(d) of this Act.\n(d)  A disability pension may be granted under this section to a member only if the member is unable to perform work or services as an employee due to the disability.  A member who is granted a disability pension is considered to have resigned and shall be removed from the employment rolls of the city or the pension system not later than the last day of the month in which the disability pension is approved.\n(e)  A person retired for disability under this Act or a person receiving survivor benefits as a disabled dependent child under this Act shall file an annual report of employment activities and earnings with the pension board.  The pension board shall establish the form of the report and the time for filing the report.  If the amount of the earnings added to the disability pension being received by the member exceeds the amount of the monthly salary of the member at the time of the member's separation from service, as adjusted annually by cost-of-living adjustments equal to the percentage change in the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers for the preceding year, as determined by the United States Department of Labor, but not to exceed the cost-of-living adjustment provided by Section 10(h) of this Act, the pension board may reduce the amount of the pension.  A disability pension recipient is not required to submit the annual affidavit of employment activities and earnings after the recipient reaches:\n(1)  the date on which the recipient would be eligible to retire, if Section 10(b) or (c) applied to the recipient; or\n(2)  65 years of age.\n(f)  A member may not receive a disability pension and a deferred or normal retirement pension at the same time.  If a member who has at least five years of credited service is eligible for a disability pension, the member's disability ceases to exist, and the member does not return to work for the city, the member is eligible to receive a deferred or normal retirement pension, beginning on the later of the member's effective retirement date or the date the disability ceases.  The deferred or normal retirement pension is based on actual credited service up to the time of disability and is computed based on the schedule of benefits and provisions in effect on the person's last day of credited service.\n(g)  A former member who is retired for disability or a person receiving survivor benefits as a disabled dependent child under this Act is subject at all times to reexamination by the pension board and shall submit to an examination the pension board requires.  If the disability retiree or dependent child who is receiving survivor benefits as a disabled child refuses to submit to a required examination, the pension board may order that payments be suspended, up to and including discontinuation of the disability pension or survivor benefit.  If the pension board determines that a member who has been retired for a disability or a person who is receiving survivor benefits as a disabled dependent child recovers so that the member or person is able to perform the usual and customary duties formerly handled by the member or person or other full-time duties that could be performed by the member or person, the pension board shall suspend or discontinue pension or survivor benefit payments.\n(h)  The result of an examination, report by a physician, or report of employment activities and earnings shall be considered by the pension board in determining whether the benefits shall be continued, increased if less than the maximum provided, decreased, or discontinued.  The pension board may reduce, suspend, or discontinue all benefits to a person receiving benefits under this section who, after notice from the pension board:\n(1)  fails to appear for a required examination;\n(2)  fails to file a report of employment activities and earnings or another related report requested by the pension board; or\n(3)  files a materially false or misleading report of employment activities and earnings or examination result or other report, as determined by the pension board.\n(i)  To apply for a disability pension, a person must be a member or a former member whose separation from service occurred not more than 30 days before the date the pension system receives the person's request to apply for a disability pension as a result of a disability that arose during employment, except that a member may not apply for a disability pension after the sixth month after the date of the member's last day of credited service.\nSec. 14.  SURVIVING SPOUSE AND DEPENDENT CHILD MONTHLY ALLOWANCE.  (a)  Except as provided by Section 11 or 12 of this Act, the pension board shall order survivor benefits to be paid to an eligible survivor in the form of a monthly allowance under this section if:\n(1)  a member or former member of group A or group B dies from any cause after the completion of five years of credited service with the city or the pension system;\n(2)  while in the service of the city or the pension system, a member dies from any cause directly resulting from a specific incident in the performance of the member's duty;\n(3)  a member of group A or group B dies after the date the member retires on a pension because of length of service or a disability and the member leaves an eligible survivor; or\n(4)  a member of group D dies from any cause after the completion of five years of credited service with the city or the pension system if the member on the date of the member's death was still in service with the city or the pension system.\n(b)  A surviving spouse of a member described by Subsection (a)(1) or (4) of this section who dies while still in service with the city or the pension system is eligible for a sum equal to the following applicable percentage of the retirement benefits to which the deceased member or former member would have been eligible had the member been totally disabled with an ordinary disability at the time of the member's last day of credited service:\n(1)  80 percent, if the member's death occurs on or after the year 2017 effective date and the spouse was married to the member for at least one continuous year as of the member's date of death, except that the allowance payable to the surviving spouse may not be less than $100 a month; or\n(2)  50 percent, if the member's death occurs on or after the year 2017 effective date and the spouse was married to the member for less than one continuous year as of the date of the member's death.\n(b-1)  A surviving spouse of a former member described by Subsection (a)(1) of this section who dies on or after the year 2017 effective date while not in the service of the city or the pension system and before the member's retirement commenced, is eligible for a sum equal to 50 percent of the deceased former member's normal accrued pension at the time of the deceased former member's last day of credited service.  Benefits under this subsection first become payable on the date the former member would have become eligible to begin receiving a pension.  If the surviving spouse elects for earlier payment, in a time and manner determined by the pension board, the actuarial equivalent of that amount shall be payable at that earlier date.\n(c)  A surviving spouse of a member described by Subsection (a)(2) of this section who dies from a cause directly resulting from a specific incident in the performance of the member's duty with the city or the pension system, without serious or wilful misconduct on the member's part, is eligible for a sum equal to 80 percent of the deceased member's final average salary.\n(d)  A surviving spouse of a retiree described by Subsection (a)(3) of this section who dies after having received retirement benefits is eligible for a sum equal to the following applicable percentage of the retirement benefits being received at the time of the retiree's death, including any applicable cost-of-living adjustment in the survivor benefit under Section 10(h) of this Act computed based on the unadjusted normal retirement pension of the deceased retiree:\n(1)  80 percent, if the retiree's death occurs on or after the year 2017 effective date and the retiree separated from service with the city or pension system before the year 2017 effective date;\n(2)  80 percent, if the retiree's death occurs on or after the year 2017 effective date and the retiree separated from service with the city or pension system on or after the year 2017 effective date, provided the surviving spouse was married to the retiree at the time of the retiree's death and for at least one continuous year as of the date of the retiree's separation from service; or\n(3)  50 percent, if both the retiree's separation from service and death occur on or after the year 2017 effective date and the surviving spouse was married to the retiree at the time of the retiree's death for less than one continuous year as of the date of the retiree's separation from service.\n(e)  If there is a surviving spouse, each dependent child shall receive a survivor benefit equal to 10 percent of the pension the member would have received if the member had been disabled at the time of death up to a maximum of 20 percent for all dependent children, except that if the total amount payable to the surviving spouse and dependent children is greater than 80 percent of the benefit the member would have received, the percentage of benefits payable to the surviving spouse shall be reduced so that the total amount is not greater than 80 percent of the benefit the member would have received, and the reduction shall continue until the total amount payable to the surviving spouse and dependent child, if any, would not be greater than 80 percent of the benefit the member would have received.\n(f)  If there is no surviving spouse, each dependent child is eligible to receive a survivor benefit equal to 50 percent of the amount of the surviving spouse benefit had there been a surviving spouse, not to exceed 100 percent of the surviving spouse benefit for all dependent children in the aggregate.\n(g)  Benefits for a dependent child are payable to the guardian of the child, except that the pension board may approve the payment of benefits to a child who is at least 18 years of age.  As used in this subsection, \"guardian\" means the person who has the primary responsibility for a child's care and support, including the surviving parent, a legal guardian, a managing conservator, or any other person with a similar legal relationship to the child.\n(h)  If a retiree dies and there is no eligible survivor, the retiree's spouse, if any, or if there is no spouse, the retiree's estate, is eligible to receive a lump-sum payment of the unamortized balance of the retiree's accrued employee contributions, if any, other than contributions after the DROP entry date, as determined by an amortization schedule and method approved by the pension board.  A pension payable to a retiree ceases on the last day of the month of the retiree's death.  A survivor benefit payable to an eligible survivor is effective on the first day of the month following the month of the retiree's death and ceases on the last day of the month of the eligible survivor's death or on the last day of the month in which the survivor otherwise ceases to be eligible to receive a survivor's benefit.\nSec. 15.  INCREASE IN BENEFITS.  (a)  In addition to the postretirement increases under Section 10(h) of this Act, the pension board may increase annuities payable under this Act by an amount that does not exceed the annual increase in the amount of premiums being paid under a group insurance program provided for retirees of the city.\n(b)  The pension board may distribute a supplemental payment to all retirees and eligible survivors who are receiving annuities as of January 1 of the year in which the supplemental payment is made.  The supplemental payment shall be credited to DROP participants who are participating in DROP as of January 1 of the year in which the supplemental payment is made, if the pension board's actuary determines that as of the end of any fiscal year:\n(1)  the value of the pension system's assets exceeds the amount of the pension system's accrued liability;\n(2)  the pension system has met the actuarial investment assumption for the previous fiscal year; and\n(3)  the issuance of the supplemental check will not cause the city's contribution rate to increase.\n(c)  A person may not receive more than one supplemental payment as a result of the person's status as:\n(1)  a retiree and eligible survivor; or\n(2)  a DROP participant and eligible survivor.\n(d)  A pension benefit or allowance provided by this article may be increased if:\n(1)  a qualified actuary selected by the pension board determines that the increase cannot reasonably be considered to jeopardize the pension system's ability to pay any existing benefit;\n(2)  the increase is approved by the pension board and the city in a written agreement as provided by Section 3(n) of this article; and\n(3)  the increase does not deprive a member or retiree, without the written consent of the member or retiree, from receiving the immediate or deferred retirement benefit that the member or retiree was eligible to receive under this article before the increase.\nSec. 16.  LUMP-SUM BENEFIT PAYMENT.  (a)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, the pension board may pay to a member, deferred participant, eligible survivor, alternate payee, or beneficiary in a lump-sum payment the present value of any benefit payable to such a person that is less than $20,000 instead of paying any other benefit payable under this Act.  If the lump-sum present value of the benefit is at least $1,000 but less than $20,000, the pension board may make a lump-sum payment only on written request by the member, deferred participant, eligible survivor, alternate payee, or other beneficiary.  The pension board shall make any payment under this subsection as soon as practicable after eligibility under this section has been determined by the pension board.\n(b)  The pension board shall adopt actuarial assumptions, including an interest rate, to be used in determining lump-sum present values and amounts distributable under this section.\n(c)  If the pension board determines that available resources in the pension fund are inadequate to make lump-sum payments, payments under this section shall be made monthly in amounts the pension board determines.\n(d)  Payments under this section may not be made for a benefit that was being paid by the predecessor system or this pension system.\n(e)  A member who is reemployed by the city or the pension system and who has at least two years of continuous credited service after reemployment may reinstate service for which the member received a lump-sum payment under this section by paying into the pension fund the amount of the lump-sum payment, plus interest on that amount at the applicable assumed rate of return, not compounded, from the date the lump-sum payment was made to the member until the date of repayment to the pension fund.\n(f)  The actuarial value of a lump-sum payment is determined as of the last day of credited service or September 1, 1995, whichever is later.\nSec. 17.  TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT; DEATH; REEMPLOYMENT.  (a)  A member who terminates employment with the city involuntarily due to a reduction in workforce, as determined by the pension board, before the member becomes eligible for a normal retirement pension or attains five years of credited service, is eligible to leave the person's contributions in the pension fund until the first anniversary of the date of termination.  If during that period the person is reemployed by the city and has not withdrawn the person's contributions, all rights and service credit as a member shall be immediately restored without penalty.  If reemployment with the city does not occur before the first anniversary of the date of termination, all payments made by the person into the pension fund by salary deductions or other authorized contributions shall be refunded to the person without interest.  If the person is subsequently reemployed, the person may have credit restored, subject to the provisions applicable at the time of reemployment.\n(b)  A member who leaves employment voluntarily, before becoming eligible for a normal retirement or disability pension, ceases to be a member of the pension system and shall be refunded all eligible payments made by the member into the pension fund by salary deductions or other authorized contributions, without interest, subject to this section.\n(c)  A former member of group A or group B whose employment is terminated for a reason other than death or receipt of a retirement or disability pension after the completion of five years of credited service may elect, in a manner determined by the pension board, to receive a deferred retirement pension that begins on the member's effective retirement date after the member attains the eligibility requirements for normal retirement under Section 10 of this Act as it existed on the member's last day of credited service.  The amount of monthly benefit shall be computed in the same manner as for a normal retirement pension, but based on average monthly salary and credited service as of the member's last day of credited service and subject to the provisions of this Act or Chapter 358, Acts of 48th Legislature, Regular Session, 1943 (Article 6243g, Vernon's Texas Civil Statutes), in effect on the former member's last day of credited service.\n(c-1)  A former member of group D whose employment is terminated for a reason other than death or receipt of a retirement or disability pension after the completion of five years of credited service may elect, in a manner determined by the pension board, to receive a deferred normal retirement pension that begins on the former member's effective retirement date after the member attains 62 years of age.  The amount of a monthly benefit under this subsection shall be computed in the same manner as a normal retirement pension, except the benefit shall be based on the average monthly salary and credited service of the former member as of the former member's last day of credited service and subject to the provisions of this Act in effect on the former member's last day of credited service.\n(c-2)  A former member of group D whose employment is terminated for a reason other than death or receipt of a retirement or disability pension and who has met the minimum years of credited service to receive an early reduced retirement pension under Section 10(e) of this Act on attaining the required age, may elect, in a manner determined by the pension board, to receive a deferred early retirement pension that begins on the former member's effective retirement date after the member attains the required age under Section 10(e) of this Act.  The amount of monthly benefit shall be computed in the same manner as for an early retirement pension under Section 10(e) of this Act, except that the benefit shall be based on the average monthly salary and credited service of the former member as of the former member's last day of credited service and subject to the provisions of this Act in effect on the former member's last day of credited service.\n(d)  If a member dies while still employed by the city, whether eligible for a pension or not, and Sections 12 and 14 of this Act do not apply, all of the member's rights in the pension fund shall be satisfied by the refund to the member's spouse, if any, or if there is no spouse, to the member's estate, of all eligible payments, if any, made by the member into the pension fund, without interest.\n(e)   If there is no eligible survivor of the former member, all of the former member's rights in the pension fund shall be satisfied by the refund to the former member's spouse, if any, or if there is no spouse, to the former member's estate, of all eligible payments made by the former member into the pension fund by way of employee contributions, without interest.\n(f)  This Act does not change the status of any former member of the predecessor system whose services with the city or the pension system were terminated under Chapter 358, Acts of the 48th Legislature, Regular Session, 1943 (Article 6243g, Vernon's Texas Civil Statutes), except as otherwise expressly provided.  Refunds of contributions made under this section shall be paid to the departing member, the member's spouse, or the member's estate on written request and approval by the pension board in a lump sum, except that if the pension board determines that funds are insufficient to justify the lump-sum payment, the payment shall be refunded on a monthly basis in amounts determined by the pension board.\n(g)  If a deferred participant is reemployed by the city or the pension system before receiving a deferred retirement pension or if a retiree is reemployed by the city or the pension system, Subsections (h) and (j) of this section apply to the computation of the member's pension following the member's subsequent separation from service if the member was a member on or after May 11, 2001, and is not otherwise subject to Subsection (q) of this section.\n(h)  If a member described in Subsection (g) of this section accrues not more than two years of continuous credited service after reemployment:\n(1)  the portion of the member's deferred or normal retirement pension attributable to the member's period of credited service accrued before the date of the member's original or previous separation from service is computed on the basis of the applicable provisions of this Act or the predecessor system that were in effect on the member's last day of credited service for the original or previous period of credited service;\n(2)  the portion of the member's deferred or normal retirement pension attributable to the member's period of credited service accrued after the date of the member's reemployment by the city or the pension system is computed on the basis of the applicable provisions of this Act or the predecessor system in effect on the member's last day of credited service for the subsequent period of credited service; and\n(3)  the disability pension or survivor benefit attributable to the member's period of credited service accrued both before the date of the member's original or previous separation from service and after the date of the member's reemployment by the city or the pension system is computed on the basis of the applicable provisions of this Act or the predecessor system that were in effect on the member's last day of credited service for the original or previous period of credited service.\n(i)  Subject to Subsection (l) of this section, the disability pension or survivor benefit under Subsection (h)(3) of this section is computed by adding the following amounts:\n(1)  the amount of the benefit derived from the member's credited service accrued after the date of reemployment based on the benefit accrual rate in effect on the member's last day of original or previous credited service in the group in which the member participated on the member's last day of subsequent credited service; and\n(2)  the amount of the benefit the member, beneficiary, or eligible survivor was eligible to receive based on the member's original or previous credited service and the provisions in effect on the member's last day of original or previous credited service.\n(j)  If a member described by Subsection (g) of this section accrues more than two years of continuous credited service after reemployment, for purposes of future payment only, a deferred retirement pension, normal retirement pension, disability pension, or survivor benefit is computed on the basis of the applicable provisions of this Act or the predecessor system in effect on the member's last day of credited service for the subsequent service.\n(k)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, if a retiree is reemployed by the city or the pension system and becomes a member, the retiree's pension under this Act ceases on the day before the date the retiree is reemployed.  Payment of the pension shall be suspended during the period of reemployment and may not begin until the month following the month in which the reemployed retiree subsequently terminates employment.  On subsequent separation, benefits payable are computed under Subsections (h) and (j) of this section, as applicable.  If the reemployed retiree receives any pension during the period of reemployment, the retiree shall return all of the pension received during that period to the pension system not later than the 30th day after the date of receipt.  If the reemployed retiree does not timely return all of the pension, the pension board shall offset the amount not returned against the payment of any future retirement pension, disability pension, DROP balance, or survivor benefit payable on behalf of the reemployed retiree, plus interest on the disallowed pension at the applicable assumed rate of return, not compounded, from the date the reemployed retiree received the disallowed pension to the date of the offset on the disallowed pension.\n(l)  Except as provided by Section 14 of this Act, if a member is covered by Subsection (h) of this section and has made an election or was eligible to make an election under Section 11 of this Act or an optional annuity election under Section 29, Chapter 358, Acts of the 48th Legislature, Regular Session, 1943 (Article 6243g, Vernon's Texas Civil Statutes), or has received a pension computed on the basis of an optional annuity election, the optional annuity election, including any designation of an eligible designated survivor, governs the payment of any pension or benefit for the period of service covered by the optional annuity election, and no other survivor benefit is payable for that period of service.  If a member meets the requirements of Subsection (j) of this section and has made an optional annuity election or has received a pension computed on the basis of an optional annuity election, the optional annuity election, including any designation of an eligible designated survivor, shall control the payment of any pension or benefit, and no other survivor benefit is payable unless the member elects, not later than the 90th day after the date of the separation of employment and before payment of a pension, to revoke the optional annuity election for future payment of benefits.  If revocation occurs, any survivor benefit is paid under Subsection (j) of this section.\n(m)  If a member's service is terminated before the member has completed five years of service for any reason other than death, a city workforce reduction as described by Subsection (a) of this section, or a service disability, the member:\n(1)  forfeits the member's accrued pension, service and credited service, and any benefit payable under this Act; and\n(2)  shall be refunded, on written request, the amount paid by the member into the pension fund as employee contributions, without interest, in full satisfaction of the member's rights under this Act.\n(n)  This section does not allow retroactive payment of any benefits or other amounts under this section to any member, retiree, deferred participant, beneficiary, eligible survivor, estate, or other person or entity.\n(o)  After separation from service, a member is subject to the schedule of benefits and provisions in effect on the member's last day of credited service, except as otherwise expressly provided by this Act.\n(p)  A person receiving or eligible for a survivor benefit under this Act is subject to the schedule of benefits and provisions in effect on the last day of credited service of the deceased participant for whom the person is claiming survivor status, except as otherwise expressly provided by this Act.\n(q)  Subsections (g) through (l) of this section do not apply to the calculation of any benefit for or attributable to the period of service following:\n(1)  the employment or reemployment of a member hired or rehired on or after January 1, 2005; or\n(2)  the reemployment of a deferred retiree or retiree who is reemployed in a pension system covered position before January 1, 2005, but for a period of two years or less of continuous credited service.\n(r)  If a deferred retiree or retiree subject to Subsection (q)(2) of this section is reemployed in a pension system covered position, the retiree's pension due on the retiree's subsequent retirement shall be computed as follows:\n(1)  the portion of the retiree's pension attributable to the retiree's periods of credited service that accrued before the retiree's reemployment shall be calculated on the basis of the schedule of benefits for retiring members that was in effect at the time of the member's previous termination or terminations of employment; and\n(2)  the portion of the member's pension attributable to the member's period of credited service that accrued after the member's reemployment shall be calculated on the basis of the schedule of benefits for retiring members that is in effect at the time of the member's subsequent retirement.\n(s)  The computation under Subsection (r) of this section may not result in a lower pension benefit amount for the previous service of the retiree than the pension benefit amount the retiree was eligible to receive for the retiree's previous service before the date of reemployment.\nSec. 18. MILITARY SERVICE CREDIT.  (a)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, contributions, benefits, and service with respect to service in the uniformed services, as defined in 38 U.S.C. Section 4301 et seq., of a member who is eligible for reemployment rights with the city under 38 U.S.C. Section 4301 et seq. for the service shall be provided in accordance with Section 414(u), Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.\n(b)  The city shall make the employer contributions to the pension fund for the employee's membership for each month of service credit in which the member is engaged in service in a uniformed service described by Subsection (a) of this section, based on the member's rate of monthly compensation as of the date the member left the member's position.\n(c)  A member who has active military service for which the member is not eligible for reemployment rights with the city under 38 U.S.C. Section 4301 et seq. may receive credited service for the active military service on proper action by the pension board if the member:\n(1)  has completed at least five years of credited service in the pension system;\n(2)  obtains, at the member's cost, a report approved by the pension board of the actuarial cost of the service for which the member claims credit, with service time expressed as a number of whole months; and\n(3)  pays the actuarially determined cost of the service under Subdivision (2) of this subsection as approved by the pension board, plus all administrative costs associated with crediting the service, if any, plus six percent interest from the due date of the amounts until the date full payment is made to the pension fund, with the payments made before:\n(A)  the fifth anniversary of the date the claim for service is made, if a member does not terminate employment before the fifth anniversary; or\n(B)  the 60th day after the date employment is terminated, if a member terminates employment before the fifth anniversary of the date the claim for service is made.\n(d)  The military service credited under Subsection (c) of this section:\n(1)  may not exceed a total of 60 months; and\n(2)  may be claimed as service solely in the group in which the member participates at the time the member claims the service.\nSec. 19.  MULTIPLE PENSIONS.  (a)  The pension board may authorize a member to make a one-time irrevocable election, on a date and in a manner established by the pension board, to cease to be a member of the pension system and, for future service only, to become a member of the retirement system governed by Article 6243e.2(1), Revised Statutes, or Article 6243g-4, Revised Statutes, or a successor statute to either of those laws, if the member:\n(1)  was a member of the pension system as authorized under Section 16B, Chapter 358, Acts of the 48th Legislature, Regular Session, 1943 (Article 6243g, Vernon's Texas Civil Statutes);\n(2)  is in a position covered by another retirement system to which the city contributes; and\n(3)  has not begun to receive payment of benefits from the pension system.\n(b)  A person who does not make an election to cease membership in the pension system under Subsection (a) of this section remains a member of the pension system as authorized under this Act.\n(c)  A person who makes an election to cease membership in the pension system is considered to have separated from service on the date of the election established by the pension board.\n(d)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, duplication of any pension or benefit payable from the pension system and any pension or benefit payable under another defined benefit pension plan to which the city contributes is not permitted.  Any pension or benefit payable to any person under another defined benefit pension plan, based on a period of service for which credited service is given under this Act, is deducted from the total pension or benefit otherwise payable to the participant under this Act, except that the pension or benefit may not be reduced to an amount less than the amount that would have been payable if the period of service had been excluded from service.\nSec. 20.  SERVICE FOR FORMERLY INELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES.  (a)  A member who was ineligible to be a member under Section 4(d), Chapter 358, Acts of the 48th Legislature, Regular Session, 1943 (Article 6243g, Vernon's Texas Civil Statutes), before September 1, 1999, because the member was receiving a pension from another pension system of the city to which the city contributes may purchase credited service solely in group A for otherwise eligible service previously disallowed by Section 4(d), Chapter 358, Acts of the 48th Legislature, Regular Session, 1943 (Article 6243g, Vernon's Texas Civil Statutes), if the member:\n(1)  has been continuously employed by the city since the date of reemployment into a municipal position that became covered by Chapter 358, Acts of the 48th Legislature, Regular Session, 1943 (Article 6243g, Vernon's Texas Civil Statutes), on September 1, 1999, by removal of the prohibition under Section 4(d), Chapter 358, Acts of the 48th Legislature, Regular Session, 1943 (Article 6243g, Vernon's Texas Civil Statutes);\n(2)  would have been eligible to be a member and receive service for the municipal employment before September 1, 1999, but for the prohibition under Section 4(d), Chapter 358, Acts of the 48th Legislature, Regular Session, 1943 (Article 6243g, Vernon's Texas Civil Statutes);\n(3)  was a member in group A on September 1, 1999, and on September 1, 2001;\n(4)  makes written application, in a manner and time determined by the pension board, to receive credited service in group A for all otherwise eligible service; and\n(5)  on approval by the pension board, pays into the pension fund all contributions that would have been deducted or picked up as member contributions during the period of claimed service as described by Section 7(c) of this Act, including required interest.\n(b)  Payments of the amounts required under this section must be completed by the earliest of:\n(1)  the date of the member's termination of employment or term in office;\n(2)  the date of the member's retirement or death; or\n(3)  the fifth anniversary of the date of the member's approved claim for credited service under this section.\n(c)  If the payments are not completed within the period described by Subsection (b) of this section, the member or the member's estate may either make an immediate payment of the balance due or receive a refund, without interest, of the member's contributions to group A for the claimed service.  If the refund is paid, the member is considered to have never been eligible for credit for the service claimed under this section.\nSec. 21.  REDUCTION OF BENEFITS; DISSOLUTION OF SYSTEM.  (a)  If the pension board determines that the pension fund is seriously depleted, the pension board may proportionately and temporarily reduce the benefits of all retirees, eligible survivors, alternate payees, and beneficiaries.\n(b)  The amount of any reduction under Subsection (a) of this section shall be paid to the retirees, eligible survivors, alternate payees, and beneficiaries if the pension board determines that the pension fund is sufficiently reestablished to pay the amounts.\n(c)  If the reserve and surplus in the pension fund become exhausted and the payouts of the pension fund exceed the income to the pension fund, the governing body of the city by ordinance may dissolve the pension system and require liquidation of the pension system without any liability to the city.\n(d)  Any retiree or eligible survivor receiving a retirement pension or survivor benefit may, at that person's option, receive a smaller retirement pension or survivor benefit after properly making a request in writing to the pension board.\nSec. 22.  EXEMPTION FROM EXECUTION, ATTACHMENT, OR OTHER WRIT.  (a)  No portion of the pension fund, either before or after its order of disbursement by the pension board, and no amount due or to become due to any retiree, eligible survivor, or beneficiary, may be held, seized, taken, detained, or levied on by, or subjected to, execution, attachment, garnishment, injunction, or any other writ.  No order or decree, or any process or proceeding, may be issued by a court of this state for the payment or satisfaction in whole or in part out of the pension fund of a debt, damage, claim, demand, or judgment against any member, retiree, eligible survivor, or other person.  The pension fund and any claim on the pension fund may not be directly or indirectly assigned or transferred.  Any attempt to transfer or assign the pension fund or any part of the pension fund, and any claim on the pension fund, is void.  The pension fund shall be sacredly held, kept, and disbursed only for the purposes provided by this Act, except that a retiree or eligible survivor may have deducted from that person's pension or survivor benefit an amount required by law or a voluntary amount authorized by law and the pension board.\n(b)  This section does not prevent the division of benefits accrued by a member under any court order determined by the pension board or its designee to be a qualified domestic relations order and the payment of a share of a retiree's benefits or contributions to an alternate payee in accordance with the order.\n(c)  This section does not prevent the offset of amounts received wrongly or in error against future pension or benefit payments under Section 3(h) of this Act.\nSec. 23.  FEDERAL TAX QUALIFICATION OF PENSION FUND; MAXIMUM BENEFITS FROM PENSION FUND.  (a)  The pension fund is intended to qualify under Section 401(a), Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and is for the exclusive benefit of the members and retirees and their eligible survivors.  No part of the corpus or income of the pension fund may ever be used for or diverted to any purpose other than for the benefit of members and retirees and their eligible survivors as provided by this Act.\n(b)  A member, retiree, or eligible survivor of the pension system may not accrue a retirement pension, disability retirement allowance, survivor benefit, death benefit allowance, DROP benefit, or any other benefit under this Act in excess of the benefit limits applicable to the pension fund under Section 415, Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.  The pension board shall reduce the amount of any benefit that exceeds those limits by the amount of the excess.  If total benefits under the pension fund and the benefits and contributions to which any member is eligible under any other qualified plan maintained by the city that employs the member would otherwise exceed the applicable limits under Section 415, Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, the benefits the member would otherwise receive from the pension fund shall be reduced to the extent necessary so that the benefits do not exceed the benefit limits under Section 415, Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.\n(c)  Any member, retiree, or eligible survivor who receives any distribution that is an eligible rollover distribution as defined by Section 402(c)(4), Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, is eligible to have that distribution transferred directly to another eligible retirement plan of the member's, retiree's, or eligible survivor's choice on providing direction to the pension system regarding that transfer in accordance with procedures established by the pension board.\n(d)  The total salary taken into account for any purpose for any member or retiree of the pension system may not exceed $200,000 for any year for an eligible participant, or $150,000 a year for an ineligible participant.  These dollar limits shall be adjusted from time to time in accordance with guidelines provided by the United States secretary of the treasury.  For purposes of this subsection, an eligible participant is a person who first became a member of the predecessor system before 1996, and an ineligible participant is a member who is not an eligible participant.\n(e)  Accrued benefits under this Act become 100 percent nonforfeitable for a member on the date the member has completed five years of credited service, except as otherwise provided by law.  If the pension system or the pension fund is terminated or partially terminated, or city contributions to the pension fund are discontinued completely, there may not be a reversion of funds to the city.  On the complete or partial termination or discontinuance of city contributions, the pension fund held by the pension system shall be used exclusively for benefits for members, deferred participants, retirees, and their eligible survivors, and the affected employees' rights to the benefits, to the extent funded, shall be nonforfeitable if not already nonforfeitable under this subsection.\n(f)  Amounts representing forfeited benefits of terminated members may not be used to increase benefits payable from the pension fund, but may be used to reduce contributions for future plan years.\n(g)  Distributions of benefits must begin not later than April 1 of the year following the calendar year during which the member becomes 70-1/2 years of age or terminates employment with the employer, if later, and must otherwise conform to Section 401(a)(9), Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.\n(h)  If the amount of any benefit is to be determined on the basis of actuarial assumptions that are not otherwise specifically set forth for that purpose in this Act, the actuarial assumptions to be used are those earnings and mortality assumptions being used on the date of the determination by the pension fund's actuary and approved by the pension board.  The actuarial assumptions being used at any particular time shall be attached as an addendum to a copy of this Act and treated for all purposes as a part of the Act.  The actuarial assumptions may be changed by the pension fund's actuary at any time if approved by the pension board.  A change in actuarial assumptions may not result in any decrease in benefits accrued as of the effective date of the change.\n(i)  To the extent permitted by law, the pension board may adjust the benefits of retirees and eligible survivors by increasing any benefit that was reduced because of Section 415, Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.  If Section 415, Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, is amended to permit the payment of amounts previously precluded under that section, the pension board may adjust the benefits of retirees and eligible survivors, including restoring benefits previously denied.  Benefits paid under this subsection are not extra compensation earned after retirement but are the delayed payment of benefits earned before retirement.\n(j)  The pension board may make any change in this Act to the extent that the change is necessary to ensure compliance with the qualification requirements of Section 401, Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or any other federal law.\nSec. 24.  EXCESS BENEFIT PLAN.  (a)  A separate, nonqualified, unfunded excess benefit plan is reenacted and continued outside the pension fund.\n(b)  In this section:\n(1)  \"Excess benefit participant\" means any retiree whose retirement benefits, as determined on the basis of all qualified plans without regard to the limitations provided by Section 23 of this Act and comparable provisions of other qualified plans, would exceed the maximum benefit permitted under Section 415, Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.\n(2)  \"Excess benefit plan\" means the separate, nonqualified, unfunded excess benefit plan that is continued under this section, that was created under the predecessor system for the benefit of eligible members, as amended or restated from time to time, and that is intended to be a qualified governmental excess benefit arrangement within the meaning of Section 415(m), Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.\n(3)  \"Maximum benefit\" means the retirement benefit a retiree and the surviving spouse or dependent child of a retiree or deceased member or retiree are eligible to receive from all qualified plans in any month after giving effect to Section 23 of this Act and any similar provision of any other qualified plan designed to conform to Section 415, Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.\n(4)  \"Qualified plan\" means the fund and any other plan that is maintained by the city for the exclusive benefit of some or all of the members of the fund and that has been found by the Internal Revenue Service to be qualified or has been treated by the city as a qualified plan under Section 401, Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.\n(5)  \"Unrestricted benefit\" means the monthly retirement benefit a retiree and the surviving spouse and dependent child of a retiree or deceased member or retiree would have received under the terms of all qualified plans, except for the limitations provided by Section 23 of this Act and any similar provision of any other qualified plan designed to conform to Section 415, Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.\n(c)  An excess benefit participant who is receiving benefits from the pension fund is eligible for a monthly benefit under the excess benefit plan in an amount equal to the lesser of:\n(1)  the member's unrestricted benefit less the maximum benefit; or\n(2)  the amount by which the member's monthly benefit from the pension fund has been reduced because of the limitations provided by Section 415, Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.\n(d)  If a surviving spouse or dependent child is eligible for preretirement or postretirement survivor benefits under a qualified plan after the date of the death of an excess benefit participant, the surviving spouse or dependent child is eligible for a monthly benefit under the excess benefit plan equal to the benefit determined in accordance with this Act, without regard to the limitations provided by Section 23 of this Act or Section 415, Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, less the maximum benefit.\n(e)  Any benefit to which a person is eligible under this section shall be paid at the same time and in the same manner as the benefit that would have been paid from the pension fund if payment of the benefit from the pension fund had not been precluded by Section 23 of this Act.  An excess benefit participant or a beneficiary of the participant may not, under any circumstances, elect to defer receipt of all or any part of a payment due under this section.\n(f)  The pension board shall administer the excess benefit plan, and the executive director shall carry out the business of the board with respect to the plan.  Except as otherwise provided by this section, the rights, duties, and responsibilities of the pension board and the executive director are the same for the plan as for the pension fund.\n(g)  The consultants, independent auditors, attorneys, and actuaries selected to perform services for the pension fund shall perform services for the excess benefit plan, but their fees for services may not be paid by the pension fund.  The actuary engaged to perform services for the pension fund shall advise the pension board of the amount of benefits that may not be provided from the pension fund solely by reason of the limitations provided by Section 415, Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and of the amount of employer contributions that will be made to the plan rather than to the pension fund.\n(h)  Contributions may not accumulate under the excess benefit plan to pay future retirement benefits.  The executive director shall reduce each payment of employer contributions that would otherwise be made to the pension fund under Section 8A of this Act by the amount determined to be necessary to meet the requirements for retirement benefits under the plan, including reasonable administrative expenses, until the next payment of municipal contributions is expected to be made to the pension fund.  The employer shall pay to the plan, from the withheld contributions, not earlier than the 30th day before the date each distribution of monthly retirement benefits is required to be made from the plan, the amount necessary to satisfy the obligation to pay monthly retirement benefits from the plan.  The executive director shall satisfy the obligation of the plan to pay retirement benefits from the employer contributions transferred for that month.\n(i)  Employer contributions otherwise required to be made to the pension fund under Section 8A of this Act and to any other qualified plan shall be divided into those contributions required to pay retirement benefits under this section and those contributions paid into and accumulated to pay the maximum benefits required under the qualified plan.  Employer contributions made to provide retirement benefits under this section may not be commingled with the money of the pension fund or any other qualified plan.\n(j)  Benefits under this section are exempt from execution, attachment, garnishment, assignment, injunction, and any other writ in the same manner as retirement annuities under Section 22 of this Act and may not be paid to a person other than to the person who would have received the benefits from the pension fund except for the limitations provided by Section 23 of this Act.\nSec. 25.  EMPLOYEES ON RETIREMENT WHEN ACT TAKES EFFECT.  (a)  Any person receiving a retirement benefit from the predecessor system immediately before the effective date of this Act shall continue to receive the same benefit amount the person was entitled to receive under the predecessor system.\n(b)  This Act does not change the status of any former member receiving a pension, or who is eligible to receive a pension, from the city or the pension system under the predecessor system, unless otherwise expressly provided by this Act.\nSec. 26.  CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.  (a)  Records that are in the custody of the pension system concerning an individual member, deferred participant, retiree, eligible survivor, beneficiary, or alternate payee are not public information under Chapter 552, Government Code, and may not be disclosed in a form identifiable to a specific individual unless:\n(1)  the information is disclosed to:\n(A)  the individual or the individual's attorney, guardian, executor, administrator, or conservator, or another person who the executive director determines is acting in the interest of the individual or the individual's estate;\n(B)  a spouse or former spouse of the individual and the executive director determines that the information is relevant to the spouse's or former spouse's interest in a member's accounts or benefits or other amounts payable by the pension system;\n(C)  a governmental official or employee and the executive director determines that disclosure of the information requested is reasonably necessary to the performance of the duties of the official or employee; or\n(D)  a person authorized by the individual in writing to receive the information; or\n(2)  the information is disclosed under a subpoena and the executive director determines that the individual will have a reasonable opportunity to contest the subpoena.\n(b)  This section does not prevent the disclosure of the status or identity of an individual as a member, former member, deferred participant, retiree, deceased participant, eligible survivor, beneficiary, or alternate payee of the pension system.\n(c)  The executive director may designate other employees of the pension system to make the necessary determinations under Subsection (a) of this section.\n(d)  A determination and disclosure under Subsection (a) of this section does not require notice to the individual member, deferred participant, retiree, eligible survivor, beneficiary, or alternate payee.\nSec. 27.  POWER OF ATTORNEY.  (a)  A person eligible for payment of a pension or other benefits administered by the pension system may direct the pension system to treat as the authorized representative of the person concerning the disposition of the pension or other benefits an attorney-in-fact under a power of attorney that the pension system determines complies with Subchapters A and B, Chapter 752, Estates Code.\n(b)  If the power of attorney under Subsection (a) of this section is revoked, the pension system is not liable for payments made to or actions taken at the request of the attorney-in-fact before the date the pension system receives written notice that the power of attorney has been revoked.\nSec. 28.  PROPORTIONATE RETIREMENT PROGRAM WITH PARTICIPATING RETIREMENT SYSTEMS.  (a)  The pension board may establish a program of proportionate retirement benefits subject to the requirements of this section.\n(b)  In this section:\n(1)  \"Combined service credit\" means the combined sum of an eligible participant's service credit in each participating retirement system in which the participant has service credit and for which the total satisfies the length-of-service requirements for normal service retirement from that system at the eligible participant's attained age.\n(2)  \"Eligible participant\" means a person who is or has been a member of the pension system and who is actively employed by the city and covered by a participating retirement system at the time of full participation by the three retirement systems established by Article 6243e.2(1), Revised Statutes, Article 6243g-4, Revised Statutes, a successor statute to either of those laws, and this Act.  An eligible participant does not include any individual who:\n(A)  is in retirement or DROP status;\n(B)  is receiving a retirement pension; or\n(C)  is in a probationary or trainee firefighter or police officer position.\n(3)  \"Full participation\" means that a retirement system has met the requirements of a participating retirement system.\n(4)  \"Maximum benefit\" means the maximum total amount of benefits payable to an eligible participant who has used combined service credit to qualify for benefits from a participating retirement system, which is 90 percent of the participant's average monthly compensation at the time the participant ceases employment in a position covered by the pension system.\n(5)  \"Participating retirement system\" means a retirement system that is established by Article 6243e.2(1), Revised Statutes, Article 6243g-4, Revised Statutes, a successor statute to either of those laws, or this Act and that recognizes and allows the use of combined service credit and disability determinations to provide proportionate retirement benefits in its system for an eligible participant under the provisions of this Act.\n(6)  \"Service credit\" means service that is credited by the rules of a participating retirement system and that may be used to meet length-of-service requirements for service retirement in the system, except that service credit that would otherwise be allowed by more than one participating retirement system for the same service period is counted only once in determining the amount of a person's combined service credit and applies as service credit only in the participating retirement system in which the person first established the service credit.\n(c)  Participation by the pension system in the proportionate retirement program is voluntary.  The pension board may elect to participate in the proportionate retirement program by adopting a resolution.  If a resolution is adopted, the pension board shall notify the other participating retirement systems of the election.  The effective date of participation in the proportionate retirement program for which an election is made is the first day of the third month after the month in which notice is given.  Participation in the proportionate retirement program by the pension system may be terminated for any reason by adoption of a pension board resolution, except that the proportionate retirement program will be continued by the pension system for eligible participants who are actively employed at the time of the termination and who remain actively employed.  On adoption of a resolution of termination, the pension board shall notify the other participating retirement systems of the termination.  The effective date of termination from the proportionate retirement program is the first day of the month following the month in which notice of termination is given.\n(d)  An eligible participant's combined service credit may be used only for determining eligibility for a normal retirement pension under this Act and may not be used in determining eligibility for DROP participation, a disability pension, survivor benefits, or any type of benefit other than a normal retirement pension, nor may combined service credit be used in determining the amount of any type of pension or benefit.  The amount of a pension or benefit payable by the pension system is determined according to, and in the manner prescribed by, this Act and the rules established by the pension board and is based solely on an eligible participant's service credit in the pension system and allowable maximum benefit.  The pension board has sole responsibility and discretion to determine the eligibility of eligible participants for benefits, including whether sufficient combined service credit exists to qualify eligible participants for proportionate retirement benefits from the pension system and the amount and duration of proportionate retirement benefits payable by the pension system.\n(e)  A person who withdraws pension contributions from a participating retirement system ceases to be a member of that participating retirement system.  Membership and service credit for which contributions were withdrawn or otherwise forfeited may be reestablished under the statutes and rules governing that system.  To be counted as combined service credit, all service in a participating retirement system for which the person withdrew contributions or that was otherwise forfeited must be reinstated in accordance with the statutes and rules applicable to that system.  A lump-sum distribution is governed by the statutes and rules applicable to the particular retirement system that distributed the lump-sum payment.\n(f)  A person who has service credit in another participating retirement system for which the person is receiving or may become eligible to receive a benefit is not eligible to vote in a pension board election or hold a position on the pension board.\n(g)  The pension board shall make determinations regarding an eligible participant's combined service credit based on the certified records of a participating retirement system, including the pension system, and of the city.\n(h)  The provisions of Section 17 of this Act relating to termination of employment do not apply to an eligible participant to the extent the participant is separated from service covered by the pension system during a period for which the participant earns service credit in another participating retirement system for service performed for the city in an amount sufficient to meet the length-of-service requirement, using combined service credit, for a retirement benefit from the participating retirement system.\n(i)  A proportionate retirement benefit may be paid by the pension system under the proportionate retirement program to an eligible participant who fulfills the requirements for receiving a proportionate retirement benefit in the pension system using combined service credit only if the participant is eligible to receive and has applied for proportionate retirement benefits from the applicable other participating retirement systems.  An eligible participant may not become eligible to receive a proportionate retirement benefit from the pension system while employed in a position covered by the pension system.\n(j)  The pension system is governed solely by its own statutory provisions, policies, and procedures relating to disability benefit determinations for members who apply for a disability pension from the pension system, except that the pension system shall pay a proportionate amount of the ordinary disability benefit attributable to the service credited under the pension system, based on the schedule of benefits in effect under this Act or Chapter 358, Acts of the 48th Legislature, Regular Session, 1943 (Article 6243g, Vernon's Texas Civil Statutes), as applicable, on the eligible participant's last day of credited service as a member in the pension system if:\n(1)  the eligible participant has combined service credit from any other participating retirement system in addition to the pension system;\n(2)  the eligible participant files for a disability pension for the first time as a member of the other participating retirement system;\n(3)  the eligible participant is otherwise eligible for a disability pension in both participating retirement systems;\n(4)  the eligible participant receives a determination from the pension board of trustees of the other participating pension system that the person has a disability that is of a type recognized by the pension system; and\n(5)  the other participating retirement system grants the disability pension.\n(k)  If the disability is determined to be service-related, the pension system shall pay only the ordinary disability benefit amount.  The pension board has the right to require examinations, reports, and any other information permitted under this Act for the administration and payment of disability benefits and the right to reduce, suspend, or terminate a benefit accordingly.  The benefit allowed under this subsection and Subsection (j) of this section is payable only if the other participating retirement systems authorize and pay a disability benefit under the same circumstances as provided by this subsection.  A person who is receiving a disability benefit from a participating retirement system is not eligible for a disability pension under this Act, except as provided by this subsection and Subsection (j) of this section.\n(l)  Creditable military service, if any, will be credited in the pension system only as provided by this Act and only if the service is not credited in any other participating retirement system.\n(m)  If the pension board elects to participate in the proportionate retirement program under this section, the pension board shall adopt rules for implementing and administering the proportionate retirement program.\n(n)  A person may not receive a benefit under this section in an amount that is greater than the amount of the benefits accrued by the person in the absence of this section.  A survivor benefit otherwise payable under Section 14(c) of this Act on behalf of a person who has used combined service credit to qualify for benefits from at least one participating retirement system shall be computed and payable as provided by Section 14(b) of this Act.\nActs 2001, 77th Leg., ch. 88, Sec. 1 to 28, eff.

Written notice shall be given each and every member of the Police Department eligible for membership in the Pension System by the Secretary of the Pension Board within sixty (60) days from the passage of this Act informing him of the terms and provisions of this paragraph.\n(b) Any person who hereafter becomes an employee of such city in the Police Department after the passage of this Act shall automatically become a member of the Pension System as a condition of his employment, and he will be required to sign a letter making application for Pension benefits.\n(c) Part-time, seasonal, or other temporary employees shall not become, nor be eligible as, members of the Pension System except as provided in Subsections (d), (e), and (f).\n(d) A city that has adopted the Pension System in this Act may make reserve, special, or part-time officers eligible as members of the Pension System by vote of the city's governing body, or the city's governing body may call an election to submit the question to the qualified voters of the city.\n(e) If a special election is called, the election must be advertised by publication in at least one newspaper of general circulation in the city once each week for four consecutive weeks.  The question shall be submitted to the qualified voters as follows:\n\"FOR:  Including reserve, special, or part-time officers in the Police Pension System.\"\n\"AGAINST:  Including reserve, special, or part-time officers in the Police Pension System.\"\n(f) A city that adopts the Pension System in this Act may include reserve, special, or part-time officers in the Pension System by vote of the city's governing body, by calling a special election as provided in Subsection (e) of this Section, or by joining the question of whether or not to include those officers on the ballot which submits the proposed Police Pension System to the city's qualified voters as provided in Section 25 of this Act.\nSec. 4. PENSION BOARD.    (a)  There is hereby created in any city within this Act a Pension Board for the Police Officers' Pension System.  Said Board is hereby vested with the general administration, management and control of the Pension System herein established for said city.\n(b) The Board shall be composed of seven (7) members, as follows:\n(1) The Mayor, to serve for the term of office to which he was elected;\n(2) The Chief of Police, to serve until his successor is qualified;\n(3) The City Treasurer, to serve until his successor is qualified;\n(4) Three (3) active policemen who shall be selected by a majority vote of the members of the Pension System;  said policemen members shall serve for a period of two (2) years and until their successors are elected and qualified.  Vacancies occurring by reason of expiration of term of office, death, resignation or removal shall be filled by an election by a majority vote of the members of said Pension System;\n(5) One (1) legally qualified taxpaying voter of the city, who has been a resident thereof for the preceding three (3) years;  such member, being neither officer nor employee of the city, shall be chosen by the other six (6) members of the Board, and he shall serve for a period of two (2) years and until his successor is selected and qualified.\nSaid Board, as herein provided, shall be selected and organized upon the passage of this Act and shall hold its office until the next general election in such city for municipal officers, at which time a permanent Board shall be selected, as herein provided.  The said Board shall organize by choosing one (1) member as Chairman;  one (1) member as Vice-Chairman;  and one (1) member as Secretary.  Beginning with the first day of January, 1952, and annually thereafter, the Board shall elect its Chairman, Vice-Chairman and Secretary for the ensuing year.\n(c) Each member of the Pension Board within ten (10) days after his appointment and election shall take an oath of office that he will diligently and honestly administer the affairs of the Pension System and that he will not knowingly violate, or willingly permit to be violated, any of the provisions of this law.\n(d) Pursuant to the powers granted under the charter of such city, the mayor shall appoint one or more employees whose positions and salaries shall be fixed by the governing body of such city and who, acting under direction of the Pension Board, shall keep all of the records of and perform all of the clerical services for the Pension System.  The salaries of such employees shall be paid by the city.\n(e) Five (5) members of the Board shall constitute a quorum, and a majority vote of those members present shall be necessary for a decision of said Board.\n(f) No moneys shall be paid out of the Pension System Fund except by warrant, check, or draft signed by the Treasurer and countersigned by either the Chairman or Secretary, upon an order by said Pension Board duly entered in the minutes.\n(g) The Pension Board shall determine the prior service to be credited to each present employee of the Police Department who becomes a member of the Pension System.  The Board shall rely upon the personnel records of such city in determining such prior-service credit.  After obtaining the necessary information such Board shall furnish each member of the Pension System a certificate showing all prior-service credits authorized and credited to such member.  Such member may, within one (1) year from the date of issuance or modification of such certificate, request the board to modify or change his prior-service certificate, otherwise such certificate shall be final and conclusive for retirement purposes as to such service.\nSec. 5. TREASURER.  The City Treasurer is hereby designated as the Treasurer of said Pension System Fund for said city Police Officers' Pension System, and his official bond to said city shall operate to cover his position as Treasurer of such Pension System Fund and his sureties shall be liable in connection with the Treasurer's actions pertaining to such Fund as fully as they are liable under the terms of said bond for the other actions and conduct of said Treasurer.  All moneys of every kind and character collected or to be collected for said Pension System shall be paid over to the said Treasurer and shall be administered and paid out only in accordance with the provisions of this Act.\nSec. 6. PAYMENTS BY MEMBERS.  Commencing with the first day of the month after the expiration of ninety (90) days from the passage of this Act, each member of the Pension System shall pay monthly into the Pension System Fund not less than four per cent (4%) nor more than seven per cent (7%) of his statutory minimum and longevity pay.  Subject to this limitation, the Pension Board shall set the amount that each member shall pay into said Pension System Fund.  Said payments into the Pension System Fund shall be effected by the city deducting the amount to be contributed by each member of said Pension System from his wages earned.  Said deduction shall be paid into the Pension System Fund by the city.\nSec. 7. PAYMENTS INTO FUND BY CITY.  In addition to the payments in the next preceding Section such city shall pay monthly into such Pension System Fund, from the general or other appropriate fund of any such city, an amount equal to the total sum paid into such Fund by salary deductions of members as set out in the next preceding Section.\nSec. 8. DEPLETION OF FUND;  REDUCTION OF BENEFITS.  In the event the Pension System Fund becomes seriously depleted, in the opinion of the Pension Board, said Pension Board may proportionately and temporarily reduce the benefits of all pensioners and beneficiaries, but such reduction of benefits shall continue only for such time as such depleted condition continues to exist, and after such time of depletion has ceased to exist and the Pension Board finds said Pension System Fund is in condition to warrant, it shall thereafter restore the benefits and resume payment of all pensioners and beneficiaries as though such preceding reductions had not occurred.\nSec. 9. INVESTMENT OF SURPLUS.  Whenever in the opinion of the said Pension Board there is on hand in said Pension System Fund a surplus over and above a reasonably safe amount to take care of current demands upon such funds, such surplus, or so much thereof as in the judgment of the said Pension Board is deemed proper, may be invested in bonds or other interest bearing obligations and securities of the United States, the State of Texas or any city or any county.\nSec. 10. TRANSFER OF PRO RATA SHARE OF EXISTING FUND.  Immediately upon this Act becoming a law, there shall be transferred to the Police Officers' Pension System the prorata share of any pension fund heretofore existing to which police officers have contributed, including the prorata part of the fund paid by the city and all accumulated interest on the money which both the policemen and the city have heretofore contributed to the fund.  It shall be the duty of the city official or officials responsible for said existing fund to make such transfer immediately.\nSec. 11. RETIREMENT PENSION.  From and after the passage of this Act, any member of such Pension System who has been in the service of the city Police Department for a period of twenty-five (25) years shall receive from the Pension Board a pension certificate.  Any person who holds a pension certificate and who has attained fifty-five (55) years of age shall be entitled to a monthly retirement pension equal to one half (1/2) of his statutory minimum pay plus one half (1/2) of his longevity pay, which he received when such certificate was awarded, each month for the rest of his life upon his retirement from the services of said city Police Department;  provided, however, said monthly retirement pension shall not exceed the sum of One Hundred and Twenty-five Dollars ($125).  However, when a member has served twenty-five (25) years or more in the Police Department and has attained the age of fifty-five (55) years, if he desires and if the physicians employed by the Pension Board agree that said member is physically fit to continue his active duties in the Police Department, he may continue such duties until he is not over sixty-five (65) years of age, and when he retires he will receive in addition to his monthly retirement pension set out above, a service bonus of One Dollar ($1) per month for each year of service over and above the amount per month payable if he had retired when he attained the age of fifty-five (55) years.  It shall be compulsory for any member to retire from service upon attaining sixty-five (65) years of age;  failure of any member of the Pension System to comply with this provision shall deprive the member or his dependents of any of the benefits provided for herein.  If at the time of retirement such member has completed less than twenty-five (25) years of service, but more than twenty (20) years of service, his retirement pension shall be prorated.  For example, if the employee has completed only twenty (20) years of service, his monthly pension would be four-fifths (4/5) of one half (1/2) of his statutory minimum pay and one half (1/2) his longevity pay.  No member shall be required to make any payments into the Pension System Fund after he has been issued a pension certificate and who has retired from active service in the Police Department.  However, if he continues to work for the city Police Department after receiving a pension certificate, he shall continue his monthly payments into the Pension System Fund until he retires.\nSec. 12. PENSIONS TO WIDOW AND DEPENDENTS.  If any member of the Police Department, who has been retired on allowance because of length of service or disability, shall thereafter die from any cause whatsoever or shall die from any cause whatsoever after he has become entitled to an allowance or pension certificate, or if while in service any member shall die from any cause growing out of or in consequence of the performance of his duty, and shall leave surviving a widow, a child or children under the age of eighteen (18) years or a dependent parent, said Board shall order paid a monthly allowance as follows:  (a) To the widow so long as she remains a widow, sixty per cent (60%) of the pension per month that said member would have received if living and had retired with twenty-five (25) years of service, provided she shall have married such member prior to his retirement;  (b) to the guardian of each child the sum of Six Dollars ($6) per month until such child reaches the age of eighteen (18) years or marries;  (c) to the dependent parent, only in case no widow is entitled to allowance, the sum the widow would have received to be paid to but one parent and such parent to be determined by the Pension Board, and (d) in the event the widow dies after being entitled to her allowance as herein provided, or in the event there be no widow or dependent parent to receive such allowance, then the amount to be paid to the guardian of any dependent minor child or children under the age of eighteen (18) years shall be increased to the sum of Twelve Dollars ($12) per month for each said dependent minor child;  and provided that such minor child under eighteen (18) years of age is unmarried.  Allowance or benefits payable to any minor child shall cease when such child becomes eighteen (18) years of age or marries.\nIf a member of this Pension System is killed while performing his official duties, or dies from injuries received while performing such duties, the same benefits payable under the provisions of this Act to Pension System members who hold a pension certificate and have attained fifty-five (55) years of age, shall be paid to the persons designated in this Section.\nSec. 13. DEATH FROM NATURAL CAUSES OR CAUSES NOT COVERED.  If a member of this Pension System dies from natural causes or from any cause not covered under the provisions of this Act, the Pension Board shall pay to his estate all of the exact amount of money he has heretofore paid into the Pension System Fund in lieu of any other benefit provided for herein.\nSec. 14. RETIREMENT FOR DISABILITY.  Any member of this Pension System who becomes incapacitated for performance of his duty by reason of any bodily injury received in, or illness caused by the performance of his duty, shall be retired upon presentation to the Pension Board of proof of the disability, and shall receive a retirement allowance equal to the percentage of his disability;  for example, if he is fifty per cent (50%) incapacitated, he shall receive fifty per cent (50%) of the amount he would receive if retired after completion of twenty-five (25) years service per month during the remainder of his life or so long as he remains incapacitated.  Provided, however, that if, at that time, he is qualified as to age and service for retirement, he shall receive the full amount of pension per month, or in the event he is past fifty-five (55) years of age and has more service than the minimum of twenty-five (25) years, and becomes incapacitated he shall receive the full amount of pension per month plus One Dollar ($1) for each additional year as his service bonus.  When any member has been retired for permanent, total or partial disability, he shall be subject at all times to re-examination by the Pension Board and shall submit himself to such further examination as the Pension Board may require.  If any member shall refuse to submit himself to any such examination, the Pension Board may, within its discretion, order said payment stopped.  If a member who has been retired under the provisions of this Section should thereafter recover, so that in the opinion of the Pension Board he is able to perform the usual and customary duties formerly handled by him for said city in the Police Department, and such member is reinstated or tendered reinstatement to the position he held at the time of his retirement, then the Pension Board shall order such pension payment stopped.  No person shall be retired either for total or partial disability unless there shall be filed with the Pension Board an application for pension benefit, at which time the Pension Board shall have him examined by no fewer than three (3) physicians, to be chosen by the Pension Board and to make their report to the Pension Board.  If a policeman is hurt while working on a regular shift or tour of duty, or if he is at home or some other place and an emergency arises wherein he has to perform the official duties of a policeman and is injured, he shall receive the benefits of this Act.  In all cases where a policeman seeks benefits under this Section, it shall be the duty of the Pension Board to determine if the policeman did receive his injuries in the performance of his duty.\nSec. 15. COMPUTATION OF PERIOD OF SERVICE.  In computing the twenty-five (25) years of service required for a retirement pension, twenty-five (25) years of continuous service shall be required;  provided, however, that in case of interruption of less than two (2) years, credit shall be given for previous service if out of service more than two (2) years;  no service prior to said interruption shall be counted, other than provided in Section 21.\nSec. 16. LEAVING EMPLOYMENT BEFORE BECOMING ELIGIBLE.  When any member of such Pension System shall leave the employment of such Police Department except as specifically provided for herein, either voluntarily or involuntarily, before becoming eligible for a retirement or disability pension, he shall cease to be a member of such Pension System.  When a member has left the service of the city Police Department as aforesaid and has therefore ceased to be a member of such Pension System, if such person shall thereafter be re-employed by the city Police Department he shall thereupon be reinstated as a member of such Pension System provided he is in good physical and mental condition as evidenced by a written certificate executed under oath by a duly licensed and practicing physician or physicians in the city, satisfactory to the Pension Board.  Prior service of such member with such city Police Department shall not be counted toward his retirement pension unless such member returns to the service within two (2) years from his separation therefrom, and also shall, within six (6) months after his re-employment by the city in the Police Department, make a written application to the Pension Board for reinstatement in the Pension System.\nSec. 17. TRANSFERS FROM OTHER CITY DEPARTMENTS.  No prior credit shall be allowed for service to any person who may hereafter transfer from some other department in the city to the Police Department.  Policemen now serving who have heretofore transferred from some other city department may be given credit for such prior service by the Pension Board.  The prior-service credits shall all be granted within sixty (60) days after this Act becomes law.  For example, if one is transferred from some other department of the city to the city Police Department, sixty-one (61) days after this Act becomes law, such person's service will be computed only from the day he enters the city Police Department.\nSec. 18. GIFTS AND DONATIONS.  The Police Officers' Pension System may accept gifts and donations and such gifts or donations shall be added to the Pension Fund for the use of such System.\nSec. 19. LEGAL MATTERS.  The city attorney of such city shall handle all legal matters for the Pension System which are referred to him by the Pension Board or city without additional compensation therefor.  The Pension Board may, however, employ an attorney, or attorneys, to handle its legal matters and shall pay reasonable compensation therefor out of said Pension System Fund.\nSec. 20. EXEMPTION FROM LEGAL PROCESS;  ASSIGNMENT OR TRANSFER.  No portion of any such Pension System Fund, either before or after its order of disbursement by said Pension Board, and no amounts due or to become due any beneficiary or pensioner, under this Act, shall ever be held, seized, taken, subjected to, detained, or levied upon by virtue of any execution, attachment, garnishment, injunction, or other writ, and no order or decree, and no process or proceedings whatsoever, shall issue out of or by any court of this State for the payment of satisfaction, in whole or in part, out of said Pension System Fund, of any debt, damage, claim, demand, or judgment against any such members, pensioners, dependents, or any person whomsoever, nor shall such Pension System Fund or any part thereof, or any claim thereto, be directly or indirectly assigned or transferred.  Any attempt to transfer or assign the same or any part thereof or any claim thereto shall be void.  Said funds shall be sacredly held, kept, and disbursed for the purposes provided by this Act, and for no other purpose whatsoever.\nSec. 21. MILITARY SERVICE.  Members of the Pension System engaged in active military service required because of a National Emergency shall not be required to make the monthly payments into the Pension System Fund provided for in this Act, nor shall they lose any previous years of service with the Police Department caused by such military service.  Such military service shall count as continuous service in the Police Department, provided that when the member is discharged from the military service he shall immediately return to his former duties with the city Police Department.  The city, however, shall be required to make its regular monthly payments into the Pension System Fund on each member while he is so engaged in such military service.  In the event of death of a member of this Pension System, either directly or indirectly caused from such military service, his widow or dependent parent or other dependents shall not be entitled to receive any benefits from this Fund.\nSec. 22. CIVIL ACTIONS.  The Pension Board of any city as herein created and constituted shall have the power and authority to recover by civil action from any offending party, or from his bondsmen, if any, any moneys paid out or obtained from said Pension Fund through fraud, misrepresentation, theft, embezzlement, or misapplication, and may institute, conduct and maintain such action in the name of said Board for the use and benefit of such Fund.\nSec. 23. PARTIAL INVALIDITY.  If any provision, section, part, subsection, sentence, clause, phrase, or paragraph of this Act be declared invalid or unconstitutional, the same shall not affect any other portion or provision hereof, and all other provisions shall remain valid and unaffected by such invalid portion, if any.\nSec. 24. FORMER EMPLOYEES NOW RECEIVING PENSION.  Immediately upon this Act becoming a law, the former employees of any such Police Department who are now being paid a pension from a pension fund, shall hereafter be paid a monthly pension of One Hundred Dollars ($100) per month out of the Pension Fund provided for herein.  Any such city shall have the right and option to pay such former employees any amount over and above those hereinabove provided for, but such additional payments, if any, shall be borne by such city and not the Pension Fund.\nSec. 25. ELECTION;  ADOPTION WITHOUT ELECTION.  The city is authorized to call an election to determine if the city desires to adopt this Act after a petition has been presented to the governing body of the city, signed by five per cent (5%) of the qualified voters of the city who voted in the last municipal election.  Such election must be advertised by publication in at least one (1) newspaper of general circulation in said city once each week for four (4) consecutive weeks.  The question shall be submitted to the qualified voters of the city at a special election to be held for such purpose at which all ballots shall have printed thereon:\n\"FOR:  The proposed Police Pension System.\"\n\"AGAINST:  The proposed Police Pension System.\"\nNo other issues shall be joined with the proposition submitted at this election on the same ballot except as provided in Subsection (f), Section 3 of this Act.\nNothing herein is to prevent the city governing body from adopting the proposed pension plan without an election.\nSec. 26. WITHDRAWAL OF MONEYS;  RETURN ON REINSTATEMENT.  Any policeman who has been relieved from duty or voluntarily quits shall have the right to withdraw all moneys paid in by him into the Pension System.  If he is reinstated in the Police Department with full seniority, he shall return to the Pension Fund the amount of money previously withdrawn when his services were terminated.\nActs 1951, 52nd Leg., p. 397, ch. 254.

(a)  Each regular full-time employee shall become an active-contributory member as a condition of employment and shall make the required deposits commencing with the first pay period in which the employee is compensated following the effective date of this Act.  Unless on approved medical leave of absence or on leave to serve in the uniformed services, the employee shall make the deposits as long as the employee remains a regular full-time employee and shall remain a member of the system until the employee or the employee's beneficiary ceases to be entitled to any benefits from the retirement system.  The membership for all new regular full-time employees shall commence on the date their employment commences.\n(b)  Membership in the retirement system consists of Groups A and B, each of which consists of the following groups:\n(1)  the active-contributory members group, which consists of all members, other than those on authorized leave of absence, who are making deposits;\n(2)  the active-noncontributory members group, which consists of all employees on approved medical leave of absence and all employees of an employer, other than inactive-contributory members, who have been active-contributory members but who are no longer so because they are not regular full-time employees;\n(3)  the inactive-contributory members group, which consists of all members who are on an authorized leave of absence and who continue to make deposits into the retirement system during their absence;\n(4)  the inactive-noncontributory members group, which consists of all members whose status as an employee has been terminated before retirement or disability retirement but who are still entitled to or who may become entitled to, or whose beneficiary may become entitled to, benefits from the retirement system; and\n(5)  the retired members group, which consists of all members who have retired and who are receiving or who are entitled to receive a retirement allowance.\n(c)  A member becomes an active-contributory member immediately on resuming employment as a regular full-time employee or on returning from an approved medical leave of absence, as applicable.  A member who resumes regular full-time employment is assigned to the group for which the member is qualified under Subdivisions (23A) and (23B), Section 2 of this Act.\n(d) It shall be the duty of the retirement board to make a final determination of the membership group to which each person who becomes a member of the retirement system properly belongs.  It shall be the duty of the chief administrative officer of each employer to submit to the retirement board a statement showing the name, position, compensation, duties, date of birth, length of employment, and other information regarding each employee of the employer the retirement board may require.\n(e)  Any person who has ceased to be a member and has received a distribution of the person's accumulated deposits may have the person's membership service in the original group in which the membership service was earned reinstated if the person is reemployed as a regular full-time employee and deposits into the system the accumulated deposits withdrawn by that person, together with an interest payment equal to the amount withdrawn multiplied by an interest factor.  The interest factor is equal to the annually compounded interest rate assumed to have been earned by the fund beginning with the month and year in which the person withdrew the person's accumulated deposits and ending with the month and year in which the deposit under this subsection is made.  The interest rate assumed to have been earned by the fund for any period is equal to the interest rate credited for that period to the accumulated deposits of members, divided by 0.75.\n(f) From time to time the retirement board, subject to the approval of the system's actuary, may elect to permit the reinstatement of membership service forfeited in accordance with the terms of this section.\nSec. 6. CREDITABLE SERVICE.    (a)  The retirement allowance of a member is based on the member's creditable service as of the member's actual retirement date.\n(b) The retirement board shall determine by nondiscriminatory rules and regulations consistently applied, subject to the provisions of this Act, in case of absence, illness, or other temporary interruption in service as a regular full-time employee, the portion of each calendar year to be allowed as creditable service.  No credit shall be allowed as creditable service for any period exceeding one month during which an employee was absent continuously without pay, except for an authorized leave of absence as provided in this Act.  The retirement board shall verify the records for creditable service claims filed by the members of the retirement system, subject to the provisions of this Act and in accordance with such administrative rules and regulations as the retirement board may from time to time adopt.\n(c)(1)  Uniformed service creditable in the retirement system is any service required to be credited by the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994 (38 U.S.C. Section 4301 et seq.), as amended, and certain federal duty service in the armed forces of the United States performed before the beginning of employment with the employer, other than service as a student at a service academy, as a member of the reserves, or any continuous active military service lasting less than 90 days.  A member may use uniformed service to establish creditable service subject to the conditions of Subdivisions (2)-(6) of this subsection.\n(2)  A member may establish uniformed creditable service for an authorized leave of absence from employment for military service under this subsection by making periodic payments or a lump-sum payment.  If the member elects to make periodic payments, the member shall make, each pay period during the period that the member is on authorized leave, a deposit in an amount equal to the amount of the member's deposit for the last complete pay period that the member was paid by the employer as a regular full-time employee.  If the member elects to make a lump-sum payment, the member and the employer shall, not later than the fifth anniversary of the date the member returns to employment with the employer, make separate lump-sum payments equal to the total amount of the contributions the member would have made if the member had made periodic contributions.  A lump-sum payment may not exceed the amount required under the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994 (38 U.S.C. Section 4301 et seq.), as amended, if the member makes the contributions within the time required by that Act.  The employee's employer shall make contributions to the retirement fund as though the member has continued employment at the salary of the member for the last complete pay period before the absence for military service.  The employer's contributions shall be made each pay period if the member is making periodic payments during the period.  During an authorized leave of absence, the member accrues membership service for the pay periods in which the member makes a deposit.  Membership service credit for a lump-sum payment accrues at the time of payment.\n(3)  A member may establish uniformed creditable service for active federal duty service in the armed forces of the United States, other than service as a student at a service academy, as a member of the reserves, or any continuous active military service lasting less than 90 days, performed before the first day of employment of the member's most recent membership in the retirement system or its predecessor system.  To establish creditable service under this subdivision, the member must contribute a lump-sum payment equal to 25 percent of the estimated cost of the retirement benefits the member will be entitled to receive.  The retirement board will determine the required contribution based on a procedure recommended by the actuary and approved by the retirement board.\n(4)  A member is not eligible to establish uniformed service credit unless the member was released from active military duty under conditions other than dishonorable.\n(5)  A member may not establish creditable service in the retirement system for uniformed service for more than the greater of the creditable service required under the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994 (38 U.S.C. Section 4301 et seq.), as amended, or 48 months of creditable service in the retirement system for uniformed service under this subsection.  A member is not precluded from purchasing qualified military service to which the member is entitled solely because the member, before beginning a leave of absence for qualified military service, purchased creditable service for military service performed before becoming employed by the employer.\n(6)  After the member makes the deposit required by this subsection, the retirement system shall grant the member one month of creditable service for each month of creditable uniformed service established under this subsection.\n(d) At any time before the actual retirement date of a member, the employer of the member may purchase for the member additional creditable service that shall be credited to the member. The incremental cost of eligibility under this subsection shall be purchased by the employer at the full actuarial cost of the additional creditable service as determined by the retirement board acting on the advice of the actuary.\n(e) At any time before a member's actual retirement date, the member may purchase noncontributory creditable service equal in amount to the period the member:\n(1) was on verifiable workers' compensation leave due to an injury sustained in the course and scope of employment by an employer;\n(2) was on an authorized leave of absence from an employer;  or\n(3) performed service for an employer in a position the service for which is not otherwise creditable in the retirement system.\n(e-1)  An active contributory member that is eligible for retirement may file a written application to convert to creditable service at retirement all or part of the member's sick leave accrued with the employer that is eligible for conversion.  The application must be approved by the retirement board.  The member may not convert sick leave for which the member is entitled to be paid by the employer.  Sick leave hours may be converted in pay period increments for the purpose of increasing creditable service that is used in the calculation of benefits.  Sick leave hours may not be used to reach retirement eligibility.  Both the employer and the member must make the equivalent amount of retirement contributions that would have been made had the sick hours been exercised and used as sick leave hours.\n(e-2)  Nonqualified permissive creditable service may be purchased only as provided by this subsection.  A member may purchase nonqualified permissive creditable service:\n(1)  only to the extent permitted under both this subsection and Section 415(n) of the code;\n(2)  in an amount that:\n(A)  for each purchase, is not less than one month; and\n(B)  when all amounts purchased under this subsection are combined, is not more than 60 months; and\n(3)  only if the member has reinstated all prior membership service in:\n(A)  Groups A and B if the member was initially enrolled as a member of Group A, but ceased to be a member of Group A, by:\n(i)  first reinstating all prior membership service in Group A;\n(ii)  next reinstating all prior membership service in Group B; and\n(iii)  then purchasing the nonqualified permissive creditable service; or\n(B)  Group B, if the member was initially enrolled as a member of Group B, by:\n(i)  first reinstating all prior membership service in Group B; and\n(ii)  then purchasing the nonqualified permissive creditable service.\n(e-3)  Nonqualified permissive creditable service purchased by members of Group B is not included in the creditable service required to qualify a member for normal or early retirement eligibility.\n(f)  The full actuarial cost of noncontributory creditable service purchased as provided by Subsections (e), (e-1), (e-2), and (e-3) of this section is payable by the member purchasing the credit.\n(g) In this section, \"noncontributory creditable service\" means creditable service for which an employer contribution is not made.\nSec. 7. SERVICE RETIREMENT AND WITHDRAWAL BENEFITS.    (a)  Except as provided by Subsection (b) of this section, a member who retires on or after the member's normal retirement date for the group in which the member is enrolled, or a member of Group B eligible for early retirement who retires, and applies in writing for a retirement allowance shall receive the life annuity (modified cash refund) or the early retirement annuity to which the member is entitled.  An annuity begins on the last day of the month after the month in which the member retired.  Unless Section 8 of this Act applies, or the member is an early retirement eligible member of Group B, a member whose employment by the employer terminates before the member's normal retirement date is entitled to a distribution of the member's accumulated deposits in a single lump sum.  On receiving that distribution, a member is not entitled to any other benefit under this Act.  If a member has at least five years of creditable service and does not withdraw the member's accumulated deposits, the member is entitled to a life annuity (modified cash refund) beginning on the first day of the month after the month in which the member's normal retirement date occurs.\n(a-1)  If not already nonforfeitable, a member's retirement benefit becomes nonforfeitable at normal retirement age.\n(b) A member who terminates employment with the employer and who has less than five years of creditable service is not entitled to a retirement allowance unless the member is eligible and participates in the proportionate retirement program under Chapter 803, Government Code.\n(c) The amount of each retirement allowance and all other benefits payable under this statute shall be subject at all times to such adjustments as may be required to ensure actuarial soundness as may be approved by the actuary and adopted by the retirement board, except that annuities already accrued may not be reduced.\n(d) Subject to the conditions, limitations, and restrictions set forth in this Act, the retirement board may once each December:\n(1) authorize a cost of living adjustment (hereinafter referred to as the \"adjustment\") payment of which, once authorized, shall be added to the current monthly payment of all retirement annuities, pensions, or allowances of each retired member and beneficiary who became entitled to benefits on or before December 31 of the year before the year in which the adjustment is approved;  or\n(2) authorize a lump-sum additional benefit payment that shall be paid to each retired member or beneficiary receiving a retirement annuity, pension, or allowance who became entitled to benefits on or before December 31 of the year before the year in which the additional payment is approved.\n(e) Before December 31 of each year, the retirement board shall make a separate determination as to whether to authorize the payment of an adjustment or additional payment and the amount of the adjustment or additional payment, if any.  In determining whether to authorize an adjustment or additional payment, the retirement board may consider the changes in the consumer price index over the preceding 12-month period, the actuarial experience of the fund, the investment experience of the fund, the amount of any prior or current adjustments or additional payments, and other factors that the retirement board and the actuary consider appropriate.\n(f) In determining whether to authorize the payment and the amount of any adjustment or additional payment, the retirement board shall be governed by Subsections (g)-(i) of this section.\n(g) Any determinations to authorize payment of any adjustment or additional payment amount must be based on the ability of the fund to pay the amount and may not be based on the individual needs of any particular retired members or beneficiaries.\n(h) Prior to the retirement board's authorizing the payment of an adjustment or additional payment, the actuary must recommend such an adjustment or additional payment to the retirement board and certify in writing that, based on the sound application of actuarial assumptions and methods consistent with sound actuarial principles and standards, it is demonstrable that the fund has and likely will continue to have the ability to pay such an amount out of its realized income after all other obligations of the fund have been paid.\n(i) The amount of the adjustment or additional payment for each retired member or beneficiary:\n(1) shall be a uniform percentage of the monthly payment being received by a member, or by a beneficiary by reason of a member, who was retired at least one year before the adjustment;\n(2) may not exceed six percent of the monthly payment due the retired member or beneficiary before the adjustment if the payment is an adjustment;\n(3) may not exceed an amount equal to the amount of the monthly payment being received by a member before the addition of any adjustment made during that year if the payment is an additional payment;  and\n(4) for members who retired during the year in which the adjustment or additional payment is authorized, the adjustment or additional payment shall be prorated, and the increase for the first year in which the adjustment is being paid shall be prorated in the ratio that the number of completed months after the member's retirement in the year of the member's retirement bears to 12.  After the first year the member is entitled to the full amount of any adjustment or additional payment without proration.\n(j) Any adjustment payments or additional payment shall be in addition to the benefits to which a retired member or beneficiary is otherwise entitled under this Act.\n(k) Any member who qualifies for retirement by reason of creditable service attained with one or more retirement programs participating in the proportionate retirement program established under Chapter 803, Government Code, shall be eligible for proportionate retirement. A member who qualifies for proportionate retirement and retires shall begin receiving retirement benefits beginning on the last day of the month after the month in which the member retired.\n(l)  A member may file a written designation, which, if approved by the retirement board, shall entitle the member, on retirement, to receive the actuarial equivalent of the life annuity in the form of one of the following options:\n(1)  Option I. 100 Percent Joint and Survivor Annuity.  This option is a reduced monthly annuity payable to the member but with the provision that on the member's death the annuity shall be continued throughout the life of and be paid to such person as the member shall designate before the member's actual retirement date.\n(2)  Option II. 50 Percent Joint and Survivor Annuity.  This option is a reduced monthly annuity payable to the member but with the provision that on the member's death one-half of the annuity shall be continued throughout the life of and be paid to such person as the member shall designate before the member's actual retirement date.\n(3)  Option III. 66-2/3 Percent Joint and Survivor Annuity.  This option is a reduced monthly annuity payable to the member but with the provision that on the member's death two-thirds of the annuity shall be continued throughout the life of and be paid to such person as the member shall designate before the member's actual retirement date.\n(4)  Option IV. Joint and 66-2/3 Percent Last Survivor Annuity.  This option is a reduced monthly annuity payable to the member but with the provision that two-thirds of the annuity to which the member would be entitled shall be continued throughout the life of and be paid to the survivor after the death of either the member or such person as the member shall designate before the member's actual retirement date.\n(5)  Option V. 15-Year Certain and Life Annuity.  This option is a reduced annuity payable to the member for life.  In the event of the member's death before 180 monthly payments have been made, the remainder of the 180 payments shall be paid to the member's beneficiary or, if there is no beneficiary, to the member's estate.\n(6)  Option VI. Equivalent Benefit Plan.  If a member requests in writing, any other form of benefit or benefits may be paid either to the member or to such person or persons as the member shall designate before the member's actual retirement date, provided that the benefit plan requested by the member is certified by the actuary for the system to be the actuarial equivalent of the life annuity with guaranteed refund of the retired member's accumulated deposits.  If, on the death of the member and all other persons entitled to receive payments under an optional benefit, the member's accumulated deposits as of the member's actual retirement date exceed the sum of all payments made under that optional benefit, that excess shall be paid in one lump sum to the member's beneficiary.  A member selecting this option may elect to receive (i) either a life annuity or one of the actuarially-equivalent annuities described by Subdivisions (1)-(5) and (ii) a lump-sum payment upon retirement.  If a member requests a lump-sum payment, the annuity requested by the member shall be actuarially reduced as a result of the lump-sum payment.  The lump-sum payment may not exceed an amount equal to the total amount of 60 monthly life annuity payments.  Active contributory members that reach normal retirement age may upon retirement elect to participate in a backward deferred retirement option program (\"backward DROP\") that permits a minimum participation period of one month and a maximum participation period of 60 months.  This deferred retirement option is subject to retirement board policies issued in compliance with the code.  No interest will be paid on, or added to, any backward DROP payment.\n(m) For purposes of Subsection (l) of this section, the designation of a beneficiary must be made in writing on a form and in the manner prescribed by the retirement board.  If a member has chosen Option I, II, III, IV, or VI, the member's designation of a beneficiary may not be revoked after a member retires, and any attempted revocation of a designation for those options is void.  Spousal consent shall not be required for a member to select Option I, II, III, or IV. If the member is married, spousal consent is required for the member to select an optional benefit other than Option I, II, III, or IV. At any time before retirement, a member may file with the retirement board a written statement designating one or more persons to be entitled to receive as beneficiary the reduced annuity payable under one of the optional benefits.  If a married member designates as a beneficiary any person other than the member's spouse, the member's spouse must consent in writing to the beneficiary designation, and the beneficiary designation may not be changed without spousal consent, unless the consent of the spouse expressly permits designations by the member without the requirement of further consent by the spouse.  The spouse's consent is irrevocable and must acknowledge the effect of the designation and be witnessed by a retirement board employee or notary public.  Spousal consent is not required if it is established to the satisfaction of the retirement board that the required consent cannot be obtained because there is no spouse, the spouse cannot be located, or other circumstances exist as prescribed by United States Treasury regulations.  Notwithstanding other provisions of this subdivision, the option election or beneficiary designation made by a member and consented to by the member's spouse may be revoked by the member in writing without consent of the spouse at any time before retirement.  The number of revocations is not limited.  A former spouse's waiver or consent is not binding on a new spouse.  An option selection becomes effective on the member's actual retirement date.  The member retains the right to change the option selected or the beneficiary designated until the member's actual retirement date, subject to this subsection.\n(n) After filing the written statement selecting one of the optional benefits, the member may continue in employment and retire any time after the member becomes eligible by filing a written application for retirement.  If the member dies before retirement but after becoming eligible for retirement, the effective date of the member's retirement is the last day of the calendar month of death, and the benefit is computed on the optional benefit selected as if the member had retired on that date.\n(o) The amount of the annuity payment in Options I, II, III, IV, V, and VI shall be determined without considering the minimum cumulative payment of the retired member's accumulated deposits since that refund feature will stay in effect as indicated herein.\n(p) If a member who is eligible for retirement dies without having filed a written selection of one of the enumerated options and if the member leaves a surviving spouse, that spouse may select the optional benefit in the same manner as if the member had made the selection or may select a lump-sum payment equal to the deceased member's accumulated deposits plus an equivalent amount from Fund No. 2.  If the member does not leave a surviving spouse, the member's designated beneficiary is entitled to elect either Option V, to become effective at the beginning of the calendar month after the month in which the death of the member occurs, or the sum of a lump-sum payment equal to the deceased member's accumulated deposits plus an equivalent amount from Fund No. 2.  If the surviving spouse dies before the spouse receives retirement allowances equal to the amount of the member's accumulated deposits on the date of the member's death, the excess of the accumulated deposits over the retirement allowances paid shall be distributed in one lump sum to the member's estate.\n(q) In the event of death of a member who is ineligible for retirement, the member's accumulated deposits and an equivalent amount from Fund No. 2 shall be paid in a lump sum to the member's beneficiary.\n(r) If a designation of intent to participate in the proportionate retirement program under Chapter 803, Government Code, has not been filed with the retirement system and a prior demand for withdrawal of accumulated deposits has not been made within seven years after termination of employment by a member with less than five years' of creditable service, the member's accumulated deposits shall be returned to the member or the member's beneficiary.  Except as provided by Subsection (s) of this section, if the system is unable to locate the member or the member's beneficiary, the member's accumulated deposits shall thereafter be forfeited and become a part of Fund No. 2.\n(s) If the member or member's beneficiary later appears and requests in writing the payment of the member's accumulated deposits, the system shall:\n(1) reinstate the account of the member;\n(2) credit to that account an amount equal to all of the accumulated deposits previously standing to the member's credit plus interest that would have been earned on those accumulated deposits if the funds had remained in Fund No. 1 between the date of forfeiture to Fund No. 2 and the date of reinstatement of the member's account;\n(3) fund the account from the monies in Fund No. 2;  and\n(4) make all necessary payments to the member or member's beneficiary from the reinstated account.\n(t) On payment of the accumulated deposits under this subsection, plus any interest on those deposits to which the member may be entitled, to the member or member's beneficiary in accordance with this subsection, the terminated employee ceases to be a member of the system.\n(u) If the member's accumulated deposits are not withdrawn, notice of intent to participate in proportionate retirement is given, and eligibility to participate in proportionate retirement is established, the member's account shall be reinstated and credited but not refunded as provided by Subsection (s) of this section, and the member is entitled to receive a proportionate retirement allowance as provided by this Act.\n(v) If a demand for withdrawal of funds is made after the 10th anniversary of the date of termination of employment and system records do not affirmatively establish that the accumulated deposits remain on deposit in the fund, the retirement board shall consider system records and evidence presented by the member or beneficiary in determining if any payment is due.  The member or beneficiary bears the burden of proof.  A decision by the retirement board is final.\n(w) In the event of the death of a member receiving a retirement allowance, the sum of $10,000 shall be payable in a lump sum to the member's beneficiary.\n(x) When monthly survivor benefits are deemed payable as a result of the death of a member before retirement, an additional sum of $10,000 shall be payable as a death benefit to the member's designated beneficiary.\n(y) In the event of the death of the retired member then receiving a retirement allowance under any retirement option and the death of the beneficiary designated by the retired member, when either Option I, Option II, Option III, or Option IV is in effect, before retirement allowances have been received that are equal or greater than the retired member's accumulated deposits, the member's estate will receive the excess of the retired member's accumulated deposits over the retirement allowances paid.\n(z)  If the person designated in writing by the member under Option I, Option II, or Option III, or, excluding a joint and last survivor option, any retirement option that includes a joint and survivor option, predeceases the retired member, the reduced annuity of a retired member who selected the optional lifetime retirement annuity shall be increased to the standard service retirement annuity that the retiree would have been entitled to receive if the retired member had not selected Option I, Option II, or Option III.  The standard service retirement annuity shall be appropriately adjusted for early retirement and for the postretirement increases in retirement benefits.  The increase in the annuity under this subsection is payable to the retired member for life and begins with the later of the monthly payment made to the retired member for the month following the month in which the person designated by the member dies or the month following the month in which the retired member gives the system notice of the designated person's death.\n(aa) Notwithstanding any contrary provision of this Act, the distribution of a member's benefits, including benefits payable after the member's death, made on or after January 1, 1985, shall be made in accordance with Subsections (bb)-(gg) of this section and shall otherwise comply with Section 401(a)(9) of the code and related regulations, including Regulation Section 1.401(a)(9)-2.\n(bb) A member's benefits shall be distributed to the member, or the distribution of those benefits shall begin, not later than April 1 of the calendar year after the calendar year in which occurs the later of the date on which the member attains age 70-1/2 or the date on which the member's employment by the employer terminates.\n(cc) A member's benefits shall be distributed over a period not exceeding the life of the member or the lives of the member and the member's beneficiary or over a period not exceeding the life expectancy of the member or the life expectancy of the member and the member's beneficiary.\n(dd) If the distribution of a member's benefit has begun and the member dies before the member's entire benefit is distributed, the remaining portion of that benefit shall be distributed at least as rapidly as under the form of benefit selected as of the date of the member's death, adjusted as necessary under this subsection.\n(ee) If a member dies before the distribution of the member's benefit has begun, the member's death benefit shall be distributed to the member's beneficiary within five years after the date of the member's death.  This five-year rule does not apply to any portion of the deceased member's benefit that is payable to or for the benefit of the member's surviving spouse.  A benefit payable to or for the benefit of the member's surviving spouse may be distributed over the life of the spouse or over a period not exceeding the life expectancy of the spouse, provided that payment of the benefit begins not later than the date on which the deceased member would have attained age 70-1/2.  If the surviving spouse dies before distributions to that spouse begin, the five-year rule applies as if the spouse had been the member.\n(ff) The five-year rule does not apply to distributions payable to a beneficiary over the life or life expectancy of the beneficiary, provided that payment of the benefit begins not later than the first anniversary of the date of the member's death.\n(gg) In applying the requirements of this subsection, the life expectancy of the member and the member's beneficiary shall be redetermined annually in accordance with regulations under Section 401(a)(9) of the code and its subsequent amendments.\n(hh) Forfeitures that may result from the termination of any right of a member may not be used to increase benefits to remaining members.  This subsection shall not preclude an increase in benefits by amendment to this Act or action of the retirement board in accordance with Subsection (d) of this section that is made possible by forfeitures or for any other reason.\n(ii)  If a member dies while performing qualified military service, the beneficiaries of the member are entitled to any additional benefits, other than benefit accruals relating to the qualified military service, that would have been provided if the member had returned from the military leave of absence and then terminated employment on account of death.\nSec. 8. DISABILITY RETIREMENT.    (a)  Only active-contributory members, inactive-contributory members, and members on approved medical leave of absence are eligible for consideration for disability retirement.  A member may apply for disability retirement at any date prior to the member's normal retirement date, and the member remains in the member's membership category for the 90-day period following the date of termination for inability to perform all employment duties.  Inactive-noncontributory members are not eligible for consideration for disability retirement and may not receive any benefits under this section.\n(b) If a member who is eligible for consideration for disability retirement has become mentally or physically incapacitated for the performance of all employment duties as a direct result of injuries sustained in the performance of the member's employment duties subsequent to the member's effective date of membership in the retirement system, the member may apply for disability retirement.  Such application, made by or on behalf of the injured member, shall show that the injury sustained:\n(1) was by external and violent means;\n(2) came as a direct and proximate result of the performance of the member's employment duties with the employer;  and\n(3) is likely to be permanent.\n(c) On recommendation of the physician or physicians appointed or selected by the retirement board that the eligible member's incapacity is likely to be permanent and after determining on that basis, or on the basis of any additional evidence which the retirement board deems relevant, that the member meets the requirements of Subsection (b) of this section, the retirement board shall award such member a disability retirement allowance.  The decision of the retirement board is final subject to the reexamination, discontinuance and revocation rules at Subsections (h) and (i) of this section.\n(d) If a member who is eligible for consideration for disability retirement, and who has more than five years of creditable service, has become mentally or physically incapacitated for the performance of all employment duties, such member may apply for disability retirement.  The application made on behalf of the disabled member shall show that the incapacity is likely to be permanent.  On recommendation of the physician or physicians appointed or selected by the retirement board that the eligible member's incapacity is likely to be permanent and after determining on that basis, or on the basis of any additional evidence which the retirement board deems relevant, that the member meets the requirements of this subsection, the retirement board shall award such member a disability retirement allowance.  The decision of the retirement board is final subject to the reexamination, discontinuance and revocation rules at Subsections (h) and (i) of this section.\n(e) On award of a disability retirement allowance, the member shall receive a disability retirement allowance, beginning on the last day of the month after the month in which the member became disabled, which shall be computed in the same manner that a retirement allowance would be computed at the member's normal retirement date, based on compensation and creditable service at the date of disability retirement. The disabled member may choose to receive a life annuity (modified cash refund) or a benefit as described by Section 7(l) of this Act as Option I, Option II, Option III, or Option IV.\n(f) A member receiving a disability retirement allowance shall periodically file a report with the retirement board concerning continued proof of disability.  The retirement board shall adopt rules establishing the required supporting information to accompany the reports, the content of the reports, and deadlines for filing the reports.  The report shall include:\n(1) a current statement of the member's physical or mental condition stating the existence of continued disability, signed by the member's attending physician;  and\n(2) a statement of all employment activities pursued in the preceding year.\n(g) A disabled member shall file periodic reports required by Subsection (f) of this section no later than the deadlines established by the retirement board. The retirement board may require that all periodic reports, including the member's most recent tax return, be filed in the same calendar month.  The retirement board may verify all information submitted in the report.\n(h) The pension director will be responsible for a yearly report to the retirement board listing those disabled members who should be examined.  The retirement board shall have the right to order examinations of any person on disability retirement each year until the member reaches the normal retirement date. If the member fails or refuses to submit to an examination by a physician or physicians appointed by the retirement board or if the member fails or refuses to submit a periodic report in accordance with Subsection (g) of this section concerning continued proof of disability, the disability retirement allowance shall be discontinued until the member has submitted to an examination requested by the retirement board and has submitted any delinquent report.  Should such failure or refusal continue for a period of one year, the disability retirement allowance may be revoked by the retirement board.  If a member's disability retirement allowance has been revoked for failure to file a periodic report or to submit to any requested examination, the retirement board may reinstate the member's disability retirement allowance on a prospective basis only on the member's full performance of and compliance with all requirements of this section and the retirement board's determination that the member's disability is continuing.\n(i)(1) If an investigation of the disabled member's activities or a medical examination shows that the member is no longer physically or mentally incapacitated for the purposes of the performance of employment duties or if the member is found to be engaged in or is able to engage in substantial gainful occupation, as defined by Social Security disability income guidelines, for which the member is reasonably suited by education, training, or experience, the retirement board shall discontinue the disability retirement allowance.\n(2) If the disability retirement allowance of a member who had less than five years of creditable service is discontinued under this subsection or Subsection (h) of this section and not reinstated, and the member is not reemployed by the employer, the member is entitled to any amount by which the sum of the member's accumulated deposits as of the date of disability retirement exceeds the sum of all disability retirement benefits paid to the member by the system.\n(3) If the disability retirement allowance of a member is discontinued under this subsection or Subsection (h) of this section and not reinstated, and the member is not reemployed by the employer, the member may withdraw any amount by which the sum of the member's accumulated deposits as of the date of the disability retirement exceeds the sum of all disability retirement benefits paid to the member by the system.  If a member has five or more years of creditable service and does not withdraw the excess, the member is entitled to a life annuity (modified cash refund) beginning on the first day of the month after the month in which the member's normal retirement date occurs.\n(j) If a disabled member returns to active employment service with the employer, the disability retirement allowance shall cease.  If the person is reemployed as a regular full-time employee, the person shall be reinstated as an active-contributory member of the system and shall comply with all requirements of this Act.  If reinstated as an active-contributory member, membership service credits accumulated prior to disability shall be restored to the full amount standing to the member's credit as of the date the retirement board found the member eligible for disability retirement, and any prior service credit shall be restored in full.  The member is not required to reimburse the fund for any disability retirement allowance amounts received by the member.\nSec. 9. LIMITATIONS ON BENEFITS.    (a)  Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Act, the annual benefit provided with respect to any member may not exceed the benefits allowed for a governmental defined benefit plan qualified under Section 401 of the code.  The maximum benefits allowed under this section shall increase each year to the extent permitted by annual cost of living increase adjustments announced by the United States secretary of the treasury under Section 415(d) of the code and the increased benefit limits shall apply to members who have terminated employment, including members who have commenced to receive benefits, before the effective date of the adjustment.\n(b) If the aggregate benefits otherwise payable to any member under this Act and any other defined benefit plan or plans maintained by the employer would otherwise exceed the limit provided by Section 415 of the code, the reductions in benefits shall be made in the benefits provided under this Act, to the extent necessary to enable each plan or plans to satisfy those limitations, unless the retirement board is informed by the administrator of the other plan that the reductions are required to be made in the other plan.\n(c)  A member who retires after reaching normal retirement age and continues or resumes employment with an employer in a position that is required to participate in another retirement system maintained by the employer continues to be eligible to receive the retirement allowance provided under this Act.\n(d)  The retirement board shall suspend the retirement allowance of a retired member who resumes employment with an employer within the period of time prescribed by the retirement board in the board's policy, or who resumes employment after retirement as a regular full-time employee of an employer.  The retirement board shall reinstate the member's retirement allowance as provided under Subsection (f) of this section.\n(e)  The retirement board shall suspend the retirement allowance of a retired member who resumes employment with an employer in a position that is not required to participate in another retirement system maintained by an employer, and who is not a regular full-time employee of an employer, if the member works for, or is compensated by, an employer for more than 1,508 hours in any rolling 12-month period after the member resumes employment with the employer.  The retirement board shall reinstate the member's retirement allowance as provided under Subsection (f) of this section.\n(f)  A member whose retirement allowance is suspended under Subsection (d) or (e) of this section may apply in writing for reinstatement of the retirement allowance when the member retires again.  The retirement system shall calculate the reinstated retirement allowance based on the member's total creditable service, reduced actuarially to reflect the gross amount of total retirement allowance paid to the member prior to suspension of the retirement allowance.\n(g)  The retirement system and the employer shall adopt and amend procedures for the exchange of information in order to implement the provisions of this section.\n(h) to (o) Repealed by Acts 1999, 76th Leg., ch. 834, Sec. 14, eff. Oct. 1, 1999.\n(p)  Repealed by Acts 2011, 82nd Leg., R.S., Ch. 1352, Sec. 10, eff. June 17, 2011.\nSec. 10. METHOD OF FINANCING.    (a)  Each active-contributory member shall make deposits to the retirement system at a rate equal to eight percent of the member's base compensation, pay, or salary, exclusive of overtime, incentive, or terminal pay or at a higher contribution rate approved by a majority vote of regular full-time employee members.  Deposits shall be made by payroll deduction each pay period.  If a regular full-time employee works at least 75 percent of a normal 40-hour work week but less than the full 40 hours, the employee shall make deposits as though working a normal 40-hour work week even though the rate of contribution may exceed eight percent of the employee's actual compensation, pay, or salary, and the employee's average final compensation shall be computed on the basis of the compensation, pay, or salary for a normal 40-hour work week.  No deposits may be made nor membership service credit received for periods during which an employee's authorized normal work week is less than 75 percent of a normal 40-hour work week.  A person who is eligible for inactive-contributory membership status and who chooses to be an inactive-contributory member shall make deposits to the retirement system each pay period in an amount that is equal to the amount of the member's deposit for the last complete pay period that the member was a regular full-time employee.

All such employee contributions shall be treated as employer contributions in accordance with Section 414(h)(2) of the code for the purpose of determining tax treatment of the amounts under the code.  Such contributions are not includable in the gross income of the employee until such time as they are distributed or made available to the employee.

To the extent necessary to authorize distributions pursuant to a qualified domestic relations order, a former spouse of a member will be treated as the spouse or surviving spouse of the member.\n(e) Subject to the exceptions provided by this subsection, the right of a member to a pension, an annuity, a disability retirement allowance, or a retirement allowance, to the return of accumulated deposits, the pension, annuity, or retirement allowance itself, any optional benefit or death benefits, or any other right accrued or accruing to any person under the provisions of this Act is unassignable and is not subject to execution, levy, attachment, garnishment, the operation of bankruptcy or insolvency law, or any other process of law whatsoever.  This subsection does not apply to a qualified domestic relations order.\n(f) If the retirement board makes an election to have Subchapters A and C of Chapter 804, Government Code, and their subsequent amendments, apply to the system, the death of an alternate payee, as defined by Section 804.001, Government Code, and its subsequent amendments, or the death of a member's spouse terminates any interest of the alternate payee or spouse that would otherwise exist under this Act, except an interest accrued by that person as a member.\nSec. 12. MISCELLANEOUS.    (a)  A person who with intent to deceive makes any statement or report required under this Act which is untrue or falsifies or knowingly permits to be falsified any record or records of the retirement system shall forfeit any office or rights held by the person under the system, and such deception, falsification, or acquiescence in falsification is deemed a Class B misdemeanor.\n(b) If any change or error in the records of the retirement system is discovered or results in any member, surviving spouse, or beneficiary receiving from the retirement system more or less than the member, surviving spouse, or beneficiary would have been entitled to receive had the records been correct, the retirement board shall have the power to correct such error.  Except as provided by Section 802.1024, Government Code, the retirement system shall, as far as possible, adjust the payments in such a manner that the actuarial equivalent of the benefits to which the member, surviving spouse, or beneficiary was correctly entitled shall be paid.\n(c) On the full or partial termination of the retirement and pensioning system, or on the complete discontinuance of contributions by all employers under this Act, the retirement allowance of each affected member who is employed by an employer on the date of termination is determined by reference to the member's average final compensation and creditable service determined as of the date of termination or partial termination of the system or the date of discontinuance of deposits as if the member had attained normal retirement age on that date, and such amount shall become nonforfeitable to the extent then funded.  This subsection does not accelerate the date on which the payment of that benefit would otherwise begin.\n(d) Notwithstanding any other provision in this Act to the contrary, the municipality or its governing body may not deny or abridge a vested right of any member or a right or privilege of the retirement system, and the retirement system shall continue to be authorized by and administer this Act without regard to any action taken by the municipality or its governing body.\n(d-1)  Members of the retirement system that are enrolled in Group A shall have the rights and be entitled to the benefits provided under this Act for members of Group A.

The interest factor is eight percent per year for the period that begins with the beginning of the month and year at the end of the cadet class for which creditable service is being established and ends with the beginning of the month and year payment is made to the system for the purpose of establishing said service.\n(3)  After the eligible member or eligible surviving spouse makes the deposit required by Subsection (c)(2) of this section, the system shall grant the member one month of creditable service for each month of cadet service established under this section.\n(d) For purposes of Subsection (c) of this section, an eligible member is a police officer employed by the city who is not separated from active service.\n(e) For purposes of Subsection (c) of this section, an eligible surviving spouse is the surviving spouse of a member who was an eligible member immediately before the time of death if the member dies before making payment to the system of the amount required by this section.  An eligible surviving spouse may establish creditable service for cadet service not later than the date that is six months after the date of the member's death and only if the lump-sum death benefit described by Section 6.05(a) or 6.06(a)(3) of this Act is not paid.\n(f) The method of determining the amount of the required payment described by Subsection (c)(2) of this section may be changed if:\n(1) the effect of the change is disclosed by the board's actuary;\n(2) the change is adopted by the board as a board rule;  and\n(3) the change applies to all payments for establishing creditable service under this section made to the system after the effective date of the change.\nSec. 5.05. PERMISSIVE SERVICE CREDIT.    (a)  The police retirement board may by rule provide that a member or eligible surviving spouse of a member, or a deceased member's designated beneficiary if there is no surviving spouse, may establish creditable service by depositing with the retirement system the actuarial present value, at the time of deposit, of the additional life annuity (modified cash refund) defined in Section 6.01 of this Act that would be attributable to the purchase of the service credit under this section, based on rates and tables recommended by the retirement system's actuary and adopted by the board of trustees.  The police retirement board may also by rule provide that a member or eligible surviving spouse of a member, or a deceased member's designated beneficiary if there is no surviving spouse, may establish creditable service by depositing with the retirement system the actuarial present value, at the time of deposit, of the additional deferred life annuity (modified cash refund) that would be attributable to the purchase of the service credit under this section, based on rates and tables recommended by the retirement system's actuary and adopted by the board of trustees. As used in this section, a \"deferred life annuity (modified cash refund)\" means a series of equal monthly payments, payable for life after an inactive member's deferred retirement date, which is on or before the last day of the month in which the inactive member would have satisfied the eligibility requirements of Section 6.02 of this Act if the member had continued as an active-contributory member, excluding any permissive service credit established under this section and excluding any military service credit established under Section 5.02 of this Act.\n(b) Prior to allowing the purchase of service credit under this section, the police retirement board shall adopt rules relating to the maximum amount of credit which may be purchased by a person under this section, the eligibility requirements that a person must satisfy before purchasing credit under this section, and such other matters as the board considers necessary for the administration of this section.\n(c)  The board may not adopt a rule authorizing the purchase of credit under this section unless the board has obtained an actuarial study indicating that adoption of the rule will not cause the amortization period for the retirement system's unfunded actuarial accrued liability to exceed the maximum amortization period adopted by the Governmental Accounting Standards Board.\n(d) The board may not adopt a rule authorizing the purchase of credit under this section if that rule would be inconsistent with the requirements of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (26 U.S.C. Section 1 et seq.) and its successors.\n(e) The board may modify or repeal a rule adopted under this section.  A modification of a rule adopted under this section must comply with the requirements of this section.\n(f)(1)  At the time a member establishes creditable service for a deferred retirement date under this section, the member may file with the board the member's written statement either selecting one of the optional benefits authorized by this Act and designating the beneficiary of the option if one is selected or stating that the member has been afforded an opportunity to select an option but does not desire to do so.  An option selection becomes effective at the member's date of deferred retirement.  The member retains the right to make a final selection until the date of deferred retirement.  The final selection is binding on all parties.\n(2)  If the member dies before the date of deferred retirement but after filing the written statement selecting one of the optional benefits, the member's survivor benefit is calculated as if the member had retired on the date of deferred retirement under the optional benefit selected and died the next day.\n(3)  In the event a member who is eligible for a deferred retirement dies before the deferred retirement date without making a written selection of an option listed in Section 6.03 of this Act and the member has a spouse surviving, the surviving spouse of the member may select the optional form of a survivor benefit in the same manner as if the member had made the selection on the member's scheduled date of deferred retirement or may select a lump-sum payment equal to the accumulated deposits standing to the member's credit in Fund No. 1 plus an equivalent amount from Fund No. 2.  If the member does not have a surviving spouse, the member's beneficiary or, if no beneficiary exists, the executor or administrator of the member's estate is entitled to select either an Option V survivor benefit (15-Year Certain and Life Annuity), effective on the member's scheduled date of deferred retirement, or a lump-sum payment equal to the accumulated deposits standing to the member's credit in Fund No. 1 plus an equivalent amount from Fund No. 2.\n(4)  When monthly survivor benefits are payable as a result of the death of a member before the member's deferred retirement date, an additional sum of $10,000 is payable as a death benefit to the member's beneficiary or, if no beneficiary exists, to the member's estate.\nARTICLE VI\nSec. 6.01. SERVICE RETIREMENT BENEFITS AND INCREASES IN BENEFITS.\n(a)  On retirement after having reached the member's normal retirement date, members entitled thereto shall receive a service retirement benefit in the form of a life annuity (modified cash refund).  Each monthly payment of the life annuity (modified cash refund) shall be equal to one-twelfth of:\n(1)  for a group A member, the product of 3.2 percent of a member's average final compensation multiplied by the number of months of creditable service; or\n(2)  for a group B member, the product of 2.5 percent of a member's average final compensation multiplied by the number of months of creditable service.\n(b) An annuity shall be considered as a life annuity (modified cash refund) with the first monthly payment due at the end of the month immediately following the member's retirement date, but the amounts of these and all other benefits payable under this Act shall be subject at all times to such adjustments as may be required to ensure actuarial soundness as may be approved by the actuary and adopted by the board, except that annuities already granted may not be reduced below the base retirement amount granted at time of retirement.\n(c)  Repealed by Acts 2021, 87th Leg., R.S., Ch. 738 (H.B. 4368), Sec. 16, eff. September 1, 2021.\n(d)  Repealed by Acts 2021, 87th Leg., R.S., Ch. 738 (H.B. 4368), Sec. 16, eff. September 1, 2021.\n(e)  Repealed by Acts 2021, 87th Leg., R.S., Ch. 738 (H.B. 4368), Sec. 16, eff. September 1, 2021.\n(f)  For purposes of this section, compensation of each noneligible member taken into account under this Act may not exceed the maximum amount allowed under Section 401(a)(17) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (26 U.S.C. Section 401).  The limit prescribed by this subsection does not apply to an eligible member.  For purposes of this subsection, an eligible member is any individual who first became a member before January 1, 1996.  For purposes of this subsection, a noneligible member is any other member.\nSec. 6.02. ELIGIBILITY FOR SERVICE RETIREMENT.    (a)  A group A member shall be eligible for service retirement if the member has attained the age of 55 years and completed at least 20 years of creditable service with the city, or has completed 23 years of creditable service, excluding any military service established under Section 5.02 of this Act.\n(a-1)  A group B member shall be eligible for service retirement if the member has attained the age of 50 years and completed at least 25 years of creditable service with the city, excluding any military service established under Section 5.02 of this Act.\n(b)  Repealed by Acts 2021, 87th Leg., R.S., Ch. 738 (H.B. 4368), Sec. 16, eff. September 1, 2021.\n(c) Any member, irrespective of the number of years of creditable service, shall be eligible for service retirement after attaining the age of 62 years.  No member shall be paid any benefits by the system so long as the member is employed by the city as a police officer or by the system as an employee of the system's administrative staff.\nSec. 6.03. ANNUITY OPTIONS.    (a)  In lieu of the life annuity (modified cash refund) defined in Section 6.01 of this Act, a member attaining eligibility for service retirement may file a duly acknowledged written designation which, if approved by the board, shall entitle the member to receive the actuarial equivalent of the life annuity by electing one of the following options:\nOPTION I. Joint and 100 Percent Survivor Annuity.  A reduced annuity payable to the member but with the provision that on the member's death, the annuity shall be continued throughout the life of and be paid to such person that the member shall irrevocably designate before the member's retirement date.\nOPTION II. Joint and 50 Percent Survivor Annuity.  A reduced annuity payable to the member but with the provision that on the member's death, one-half of the annuity shall be continued throughout the life of and be paid to the person that the member shall irrevocably designate before the member's retirement date.\nOPTION III. Joint and 66-2/3 Percent Survivor Annuity.  A reduced annuity payable to the member but with the provision that on the member's death, two-thirds of the annuity shall be continued throughout the life of and be paid to the person that the member shall irrevocably designate before the member's retirement date.\nOPTION IV. Joint and 66-2/3 Percent Last Survivor Annuity.  A reduced annuity payable to the member but with the provision that two-thirds of the annuity to which the member would be entitled shall be continued throughout the life of and be paid to the survivor after the death of either the member or the person that the member shall irrevocably designate before the member's retirement date.\nOPTION V. 15-Year Certain and Life Annuity.  A reduced annuity shall be payable to the member for life.  In the event of the member's death before 180 monthly payments have been made, the remainder of the 180 payments are payable to the member's beneficiary or, if one does not exist, to the member's estate.\n(b) The amount of the annuity payment in Options I, II, III, IV, and V shall be determined without considering the minimum cumulative payment of the retired member's accumulated deposits since that refund feature will stay in effect as indicated in Subsection (b), Section 6.06, of this Act.\nSec. 6.04. TERMINATION PRIOR TO RETIREMENT;  TREATMENT OF ACCUMULATED DEPOSITS.    (a)  On employment termination, the member shall receive the amount of the accumulated deposits standing to the member's credit in one lump sum, except that if such member has had at least 10 years of creditable service at the time the member separates from service, the member shall have a right to elect to leave the member's accumulated deposits with the police retirement system until such time as the member shall have applied in writing for service retirement and shall have attained an age at which the member shall have become entitled to receive a service retirement benefit under this Act, at which time the member shall be entitled to a service retirement benefit computed under the formula in Section 6.01(a) of this Act in effect on the last day of the month immediately preceding the month of the first benefit payment.\n(b)  If a member who has attained the applicable age for the minimum distribution required under Section 401(a)(9) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (26 U.S.C. Section 401(a)(9)) separates or has separated from service without applying for retirement or a refund of accumulated deposits, the police retirement system shall attempt to send to that member a written notice as soon as practicable after the later of the date the member attains the applicable age or the date the member separates from service.  The written notice must advise the member of the requirement under Section 401(a)(9) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (26 U.S.C. Section 401(a)(9)) to retire and begin receiving a monthly retirement benefit.  If, before the 91st day after the date the police retirement system sends the notice, the member has not filed an application for retirement or a refund, the member is considered to have retired on the last day of the third month following the later of the two dates specified by this subsection.  If applicable, the retirement option shall be determined in accordance with the member's written selection of optional benefit and designation of beneficiary under Section 6.06(a)(1) of this Act.  Otherwise, the member shall receive the life annuity under Section 6.01 of this Act.\nSec. 6.05. DEATH OF A MEMBER;  TREATMENT OF ACCUMULATED DEPOSITS.    (a)  In the event of death of a member who is ineligible for retirement, the accumulated deposits standing to the member's credit in Fund No. 1 and an equivalent amount from Fund No. 2 shall be payable in a lump sum to the member's beneficiary or, if no beneficiary, to the member's estate, unless the member shall have directed otherwise in writing duly acknowledged and filed with the board.  The lump sum may not be less than $10,000. When the $10,000 minimum is payable, the amount payable from Fund No. 2 is $10,000 minus the accumulated deposits standing to the member's credit in Fund No. 1.\n(b) Seven years after a member separates from service with less than 10 years' service, if no previous demand has been made, any accumulated deposits standing to the member's credit shall be returned to the member or to the member's estate, but if the contributor or the member's personal representative cannot be found or if the member dies without leaving heirs or legatees, the member's accumulated deposits shall thereafter become a part of Fund No. 2.\n(c)  In the event of death of a member receiving a retirement benefit, the sum of $10,000 shall be payable in a lump sum to the member's beneficiary or, if no beneficiary, to the member's estate, unless the member shall have directed otherwise in writing, duly acknowledged and filed with the board.  The payment under this subsection shall be made from the retiree death benefits fund described in Section 6.08 of this Act.\nSec. 6.06. SELECTING OPTIONS;  DESIGNATING BENEFICIARIES.    (a)  (1) Within one year prior to the date on which a member becomes eligible for service retirement under any provision of this article, the member may file with the board the member's written statement either selecting one of the optional benefits authorized by this Act and designating the beneficiary of the option if one is selected or stating that the member has been afforded an opportunity to select an option but does not desire to do so.  An option selection shall become effective at the member's date of eligibility for service retirement.  The member shall retain the right to make a final selection until the date of retirement.  The final selection shall be binding on all parties.\n(2) After filing the written statement selecting one of the optional benefits, the member may continue in service and thereafter retire any time after eligibility by filing a written application for service retirement.  If the member dies before retirement but after becoming eligible for service retirement, the member's survivor benefit is calculated as if the member had retired on the last day of the calendar month of death under the optional benefit selected.\n(3) In the event a member who is eligible for service retirement dies without making a written selection of one of the options listed in Section 6.03 of this Act and if the member leaves a spouse surviving, then the surviving spouse of such member may select the optional form of the survivor benefit in the same manner as if the member had made the selection or may select a lump-sum payment equal to the accumulated deposits standing to the member's credit in Fund No. 1 plus an equivalent amount from Fund No. 2.  If the member leaves no spouse surviving, then the member's beneficiary, or if no beneficiary exists, the executor or administrator of the estate of the member, is entitled to elect either an Option V survivor benefit (15-Year Certain and Life Annuity), effective the last day of the calendar month in which the death of the member occurs, or a lump-sum payment equal to the accumulated deposits standing to the member's credit in Fund No. 1 plus an equivalent amount from Fund No. 2.  In the event of the death of the surviving spouse before having received survivor benefits equal to the amount of the member's accumulated deposits at date of the member's death, the excess of such accumulated deposits over the survivor benefits paid shall be refunded in one sum to the member's estate.\n(4)  When monthly survivor benefits are payable as a result of the death of a member before retirement, an additional sum of $10,000 shall be payable as a death benefit to the member's beneficiary or, if no beneficiary exists, to the member's estate.\n(b) In the event of death of the retired member under any retirement option and the death of the person irrevocably designated by the retired member when Option I, Option II, Option III, Option IV, or Option VI, as that option existed before the amendment of Section 6.03(a) of this Act by H.B. No. 1242 or S.B. No. 588, Acts of the 75th Legislature, Regular Session, 1997, as described in Section 6.03 of this Act is in effect, before monthly retirement benefits have been received that are equal to or greater than the retired member's accumulated deposits, then the member's estate will receive the excess of the retired member's accumulated deposits over the retirement benefits paid.\nSec. 6.07. RETROACTIVE DEFERRED RETIREMENT OPTION PLAN.    (a)  The retroactive deferred retirement option plan, referred to as RETRO DROP, is an option a member eligible for service retirement based on 23 years of creditable service, excluding any military service established under Section 5.02 of this Act, may elect at retirement subject to the conditions of this section.  The number of years of creditable service required for this option to be available to a member may be changed if the change:\n(1) is approved by the board's actuary;\n(2) is approved by the board as a board rule;\n(3) applies to all persons who are members on the effective date of the change and all persons who become members after the effective date of the change;  and\n(4) does not increase the requirements for a person who already is eligible to participate in RETRO DROP on the effective date of the change.\n(b) The member shall select the RETRO DROP benefit computation date.  The date:\n(1) must be the last day of the month used for the purpose of determining the monthly retirement benefit;\n(2) may not precede the date the member first became eligible for service retirement based on the years of creditable service required under Subsection (a);  and\n(3) may not precede the date of retirement by more than 36 months.\n(c) On the election of RETRO DROP and the selection of the RETRO DROP benefit computation date, the member's monthly life annuity (modified cash refund) is computed according to Section 6.01 of this Act as if the member had retired on the RETRO DROP benefit computation date but including any creditable service established after that date under Section 5.02, Section 5.03, or Section 5.04 of this Act.  In lieu of the life annuity (modified cash refund) defined by Section 6.01 of this Act, the member may file a duly acknowledged written designation to elect one of the annuity options described by Section 6.03 of this Act in effect at retirement that are actuarially equivalent at the RETRO DROP benefit computation date.\n(d) The RETRO DROP benefit accumulation period includes each month from the month following the RETRO DROP benefit computation date through the month of retirement.  The RETRO DROP benefit accumulates month by month during the accumulation period as the sum of:\n(1) the monthly annuity amounts that would have been paid during the RETRO DROP benefit accumulation period;\n(2) deposits made by the member to the police retirement system as a percent of the basic hourly earnings of the member during the RETRO DROP benefit accumulation period;  and\n(3) interest credited on the RETRO DROP benefit during the RETRO DROP benefit accumulation period.\n(e)  The first monthly annuity amount that would have been paid during the RETRO DROP benefit accumulation period is the amount defined by Subsection (c) of this section.\n(f) The interest credited to the RETRO DROP benefit during the accumulation period shall be credited on each December 31 in the RETRO DROP benefit accumulation period in an amount equal to five percent of the amount of the RETRO DROP benefit as of January 1 of the same calendar year.  If the month of retirement is other than December, the interest shall be credited for the partial year at the end of the month of retirement in an amount equal to five-twelfths of one percent of the amount of the accumulated RETRO DROP benefit as of January 1 of that year multiplied by the number of complete months of service in that year.  A complete month does not include a month in which service amounted to fewer than 15 days.\n(g) A member who elects RETRO DROP receives both a monthly annuity and a RETRO DROP benefit.  The first monthly annuity payment shall be on the last day of the month immediately following the month of retirement.  Unless the member elects to receive partial payments of the RETRO DROP benefit as provided by Subsection (h), the member shall receive a lump-sum payment equal to the accumulated RETRO DROP benefit, which amount shall be paid to the member on the date selected by the member.  The date must be a business day and must be not earlier than the last day of the month immediately following the month of retirement. If the member dies before the member receives the lump sum, the lump sum is payable to the member's beneficiary or, if no beneficiary exists, to the member's estate, unless the member has directed otherwise in a duly acknowledged writing filed with the board.\n(h) Instead of a single lump-sum payment, a member may elect to receive partial payments from the member's RETRO DROP account for each calendar year in an amount elected by the member.  The board may establish procedures concerning partial payments, including limitations on timing and frequency of those payments.  A member who elects partial payments may, at any time, elect to receive the member's entire remaining RETRO DROP account balance in a single lump-sum payment, with the payment to be made under rules adopted by the board.\n(i) If a member elects partial payments, the member's RETRO DROP account shall be credited with earnings and losses of the system under this subsection for periods after the member's retirement date and before the member's RETRO DROP account is completely distributed.  The member's RETRO DROP account shall be credited with earnings or losses at an annual rate established under a rule adopted by the board.  The board may change the annual rate from time to time by amending that rule.\n(j) The board may modify or eliminate the RETRO DROP provisions of this section by the adoption of board rules if the modification or elimination is approved by the board's actuary and would not cause the amortization period for the retirement system's unfunded actuarial liability to exceed the maximum amortization period adopted by the Governmental Accounting Standards Board.\nSec. 6.08. RETIREE DEATH BENEFIT FUND.    (a)  The police retirement board shall establish a retiree death benefit fund and shall deposit in such fund contributions paid by the city to provide retiree death benefits in accordance with this section.  The board may, but is not required to, credit interest to the retiree death benefit fund annually at such rate as the board may determine.\n(b) The police retirement system shall pay death benefits under Section 6.05(c) of this Act only from money in the retiree death benefit fund, and the benefits are not an obligation of other funds of the retirement system.\n(c) Based upon the recommendation of the system's actuary, the board shall adopt such rates and tables as are considered necessary to determine the retiree death benefit fund contribution rate of the city.  At the same time as the actuary makes a valuation of the assets and liabilities of the system pursuant to Section 3.09 of this Act, the actuary shall also make an actuarial valuation of the assets and liabilities of the retiree death benefit fund, and upon recommendation by the actuary, the board shall adjust the rates and tables for the retiree death benefit fund.\n(d) If at any time the amount of payments due from the retiree death benefit fund exceeds the balance of such fund, the board may direct that funds be transferred from the general retirement fund to the retiree death benefit fund in such amounts as are necessary to cover the deficiency.  Any sums transferred to the retiree death benefit fund under this subsection shall be repaid to the general retirement fund of the retirement system at such time as subsequent contributions by the city have resulted in the accumulation of a sufficient amount in the retiree death benefit fund for such a repayment to appear prudent.\n(e) Contributions by the city to the retiree death benefit fund shall be made at the same time as the city makes its contribution to the retirement system under Section 8.01 of this Act, and the amount of the city's contribution under Section 8.01 of this Act each pay period shall be reduced by the amount of the city's contribution to the retiree death benefit fund for that same pay period.\nARTICLE VII\nSec. 7.01. DISABILITY RETIREMENT.    (a)  Only members who are classified as Active-Contributory or Inactive-Contributory, pursuant to Subsection (e) of Section 4.01 of this Act, or who are approved for extended disability retirement eligibility under this subsection, are eligible for consideration for disability retirement pursuant to this article.  A member may be approved by the board for extended disability retirement eligibility only:\n(1)  if that member applies in writing to the board for extended eligibility on a date not earlier than the 30th day before and not later than the 30th day after the date of becoming an Active-Noncontributory member, setting forth the reason why the member should be granted the extended eligibility;\n(2)  if the board, in its sole discretion, approves the application for extended eligibility; and\n(3)  on the terms the board determines to be appropriate.\n(b)(1) If a member with less than 10 years of creditable service has become mentally or physically incapacitated for the performance of the employment duties the member had immediately before incapacitation as a direct result of injuries sustained subsequent to the member's effective date of membership in the police retirement system, the member may apply for disability retirement.  Such application made for or on behalf of the injured member shall show that the injury sustained was as a direct or proximate result of the performance of the member's employment duties with the city or with the system and that it is likely to result in the member's inability to perform the duties of a position offered to the member in the system, the police department, or any other department in the city that pays as much or more than the current pay of the position the member was holding on the date of the member's disability.\n(2) On recommendation of physicians or vocational rehabilitation experts appointed or selected by the board that the member's incapacity is likely to result in the member's inability to perform the duties of a position offered to the member in the system, the police department, or any other department in the city that pays as much or more than the current pay of the position the member was holding at the date of the member's disability and after considering any additional evidence which the board deems relevant, the board may award such member disability retirement benefits.  The decision of the board is final.\n(c) If a member with more than 10 years of creditable service has become mentally or physically incapacitated for the performance of the employment duties the member had immediately before incapacitation, the member may apply for disability retirement.  Such application made for or on behalf of the disabled member shall show that the incapacity is likely to result in the member's inability to perform the duties of a position offered to such member in the system, the police department, or any other department in the city that pays as much or more than the current pay of the position the member was holding on the date of the member's disability.  On recommendation of physicians or vocational rehabilitation experts appointed or selected by the board that the member's incapacity is likely to result in the member's inability to perform the duties of a position offered to the member in the system, the police department, or any other department in the city that pays as much or more than the current pay of the position the member was holding on the date of the member's disability and after considering any additional evidence which the board deems relevant, the board may award such member disability retirement benefits.  The decision of the board is final.\nSec. 7.02. COMPUTATION OF DISABILITY BENEFIT.    (a)  On award of disability retirement benefits, the member shall receive a disability retirement benefit computed in the same manner that a service retirement benefit would be computed at the member's normal retirement date, based on average final compensation and creditable service at date of disability retirement without reduction for early retirement.  If the disability is a direct or proximate result of the performance of the member's employment duties with the system or the city, then the disability retirement benefit will be subject to a minimum benefit determined in accordance with Section 6.01(a)(1) or (2) of this Act, as applicable, based on:\n(1)  average final compensation at date of disability retirement; and\n(2)  for:\n(A)  a group A member, 20 years of creditable service; or\n(B)  a group B member, 25 years of creditable service.\n(a-1)  The options allowed under this section are life annuity or its actuarial equivalent payable in the form described as Option I, Option II, Option III, Option IV, or Option V in Section 6.03 of this Act.  The disability benefits paid to the member will be paid from Fund No. 1 until the amount received equals the member's accumulated deposits; thereafter the benefits will be paid from Fund No. 2.\n(b)  Repealed by Acts 2021, 87th Leg., R.S., Ch. 738 (H.B. 4368), Sec. 16, eff. September 1, 2021.\nSec. 7.03. DISABILITY BENEFIT REPORTS.    (a)  (1) A member receiving a disability retirement benefit is required to file a report to the board concerning continued proof of disability one year after the date on which the board originally awarded the member disability retirement.  The report shall include:\n(A) a current statement of the member's physical and/or mental condition, signed by the member's attending physician;  and\n(B) a statement of all employment activities pursued in the preceding one-year period and a copy of federal income tax returns applicable to the one-year period.\n(2) The board may verify all information submitted in this report.  A disabled member shall file an annual report containing this same type of information every year thereafter on the anniversary date of the member's disability retirement;  the annual report shall be filed no later than 60 days following the due date.\n(b) The pension officer is responsible for a yearly report to the board listing those disabled members who should be examined.  The board shall have the right to order an examination of any person on disability retirement after the member has received a disability retirement benefit for a one-year period and continuing on an annual basis thereafter until the member reaches the age of 62 years.  If the member refuses to submit to an examination by physicians or vocational rehabilitation experts appointed or selected by the board or if the member refuses to submit an annual report concerning continued proof of disability, the disability retirement benefit shall be discontinued until such refusal is withdrawn.\n(c)(1) If, during the first 2-1/2 years, the annual medical examination shows that the member is able to perform the duties of a position offered to the member in the system, the police department, or any other department in the city that pays as much or more than the current pay of the position the member was holding on the date of the member's disability, the board may discontinue the disability retirement benefit. If after the disabled member has received disability benefits from the system for at least 2-1/2 years the member is able to perform the duties of any occupation for which the member is reasonably suited by education, training, or experience, the board shall review and modify the disability benefit according to the following provisions:\n(A) if the member is able to earn at least as much money in the member's new job as the member would have in the member's most recent position with the system or the police department, the board may terminate the member's benefit;\n(B) if the member is able to earn between one-half as much money and as much money in the member's new job as the member would have in the member's most recent position with the system or the police department, the board may reduce the monthly disability benefit to one-half of its original amount;  or\n(C) if the member is not able to earn at least one-half as much money in the member's new job as the member would have in the member's most recent position with the system or the police department, the board may continue the benefit unchanged.\n(2) If the member who received a disability benefit pursuant to Subsection (b) of Section 7.01 of this Act has the member's benefit discontinued pursuant to this provision and does not return to the employ of the system or the police department, any remaining balance of Fund No. 1 benefits will be refunded to the member.  If the member who received a disability benefit pursuant to Subsection (c) of Section 7.01 of this Act has the member's benefit discontinued pursuant to this provision and does not return to the employ of the system or the police department, the member's accumulated deposits shall remain in the system, and the member shall be considered a vested noncontributory member unless the member elects a refund of the remaining accumulated deposits.\n(d) If a disabled member returns to employment with the city as a police officer or to employment with the system, the disability retirement benefit shall cease.  Such person shall be reinstated as an active member of the system and shall comply with all requirements.  Creditable service accumulated prior to disability shall be restored to the full amount standing to the member's credit as of the date the board found the member eligible for disability retirement.\n(e) The board may reinstate any disability benefit that has been previously terminated or reduced if the disabled member's condition has worsened due to the same cause for which the member was originally disabled.\nARTICLE VIII\nSec. 8.01.  MEMBER CONTRIBUTIONS.  (a)  Deposits by the members to the police retirement system shall be made at a rate of at least:\n(1)  13 percent of the basic hourly earnings of the member, for each pay period beginning before January 1, 2022; and\n(2)  15 percent of the basic hourly earnings of the member, for each pay period beginning on or after January 1, 2022, unless a different member contribution rate is required in accordance with Section 8.04(b)(4) of this Act, as adjusted, if applicable, under Section 8.065 of this Act, except that the rate may not exceed 17 percent.\n(a-1)  Deposits required to be made by members under Subsection (a) of this section shall be deducted from payroll each pay period.\n(a-2)  On recommendation of the board, the Active--Contributory members may by a majority of those voting increase the rate of member deposits above the minimum rate of deposit established by Subsection (a) of this section to whatever amount the board has recommended.  If the deposit rate for members has been increased to a rate above the rate established by Subsection (a) of this section in accordance with this subsection, the rate may be decreased to a rate not lower than the rate prescribed by Subsection (a)(2) of this section if the board recommends the decrease, the board's actuary approves the decrease, and a majority of the Active--Contributory members voting on the matter approve the decrease.  If an increase in the member contribution rate is made solely as the result of an adjustment under Section 8.065 of this Act, that increase may not be decreased under this subsection.\nSec. 8.02.  CITY CONTRIBUTIONS.  (a)  The city shall contribute amounts equal to 21 percent of the basic hourly earnings of each member employed by the city for all pay periods beginning after September 30, 2012, and before January 1, 2022, subject to additional amounts as provided by Section 8.07 of this Act.  For all pay periods beginning on or after January 1, 2022, the city shall make contributions to the police retirement system in accordance with Subsections (b) and (c) of this section and Sections 8.03, 8.04, 8.05, and 8.06 of this Act, as applicable, and subject to additional amounts as provided by Section 8.07 of this Act. The city council may also authorize the city to make additional contributions to the police retirement system in whatever amount the city council may determine.  Contributions by the city shall be made each pay period.\n(b)  For each pay period that begins on or after January 1, 2022, and before January 1, 2023, the city shall contribute an amount equal to the sum of:\n(1)  the city contribution rate, as determined in the initial risk sharing valuation study conducted under Section 8.03 of this Act, multiplied by the pensionable payroll for the applicable pay period; and\n(2)  1/26 of the city legacy contribution amount for the 2022 calendar year, as determined and adjusted in the initial risk sharing valuation study conducted under Section 8.03 of this Act.\n(c)  For each pay period that begins on or after January 1, 2023, the city shall contribute an amount equal to the sum of:\n(1)  the city contribution rate for the applicable calendar year, as determined in a subsequent risk sharing valuation study conducted under Section 8.04 of this Act and adjusted under Section 8.05 or 8.06 of this Act, as applicable, multiplied by the pensionable payroll for the applicable pay period; and\n(2)  1/26 of the city legacy contribution amount for the applicable calendar year, as determined and adjusted in the initial risk sharing valuation study conducted under Section 8.03 of this Act.\nSec. 8.03.  INITIAL RISK SHARING VALUATION STUDY.  (a)  The police retirement system shall cause the system's actuary to prepare an initial risk sharing valuation study that is dated as of December 31, 2020, in accordance with this section.\n(b)  The initial risk sharing valuation study must:\n(1)  except as otherwise provided by this section, be prepared in accordance with the requirements of Section 8.04 of this Act;\n(2)  be based on the actuarial assumptions that were used by the system's actuary in the valuation completed for the year ended December 31, 2020;\n(3)  project the corridor midpoint for the next 30 calendar years beginning with the calendar year that begins on January 1, 2022; and\n(4)  include a schedule of city legacy contribution amounts for 30 calendar years beginning with the calendar year that begins on January 1, 2022.\n(c)  For purposes of Subsection (b)(4) of this section, the schedule of city legacy contribution amounts must be determined in such a manner that the total annual city legacy contribution amount for the first three calendar years will result in a phase-in of the anticipated increase in the city's contribution rate from the calendar year that begins on January 1, 2021, in accordance with Subsection (a) of this section, to the rate equal to the sum of the estimated contribution rate for the calendar year that begins on January 1, 2022, and the rate of pensionable payroll equal to the city legacy contribution amount for January 1, 2022, determined as if there was no phase-in of the increase to the city legacy contribution amount.  The phase-in must reflect approximately one-third of the increase each year over the three-year phase-in period.  The city's contribution under Section 8.02 of this Act for:\n(1)  the calendar years that begin on January 1, 2022, January 1, 2023, and January 1, 2024, must be adjusted to reflect the impact of the phase-in prescribed by this section; and\n(2)  each calendar year that begins on January 1, 2025, through January 1, 2051, must reflect a city legacy contribution amount that is three percent greater than the city legacy contribution amount for the preceding calendar year.\n(d)  The estimated city contribution rate for the calendar year that begins on January 1, 2022, must be based on the projected pensionable payroll, as determined under the initial risk sharing valuation study required by this section, assuming a payroll growth rate of three percent.\nSec. 8.04.  SUBSEQUENT RISK SHARING VALUATION STUDIES.  (a)  For each calendar year beginning after December 31, 2020, the police retirement system shall cause the system's actuary to prepare a risk sharing valuation study in accordance with this section and actuarial standards of practice.\n(b)  Each risk sharing valuation study must:\n(1)  be dated as of the last day of the calendar year for which the study is required to be prepared;\n(2)  calculate the unfunded actuarial accrued liability of the system as of the last day of the applicable calendar year, including the liability layer, if any, associated with the most recently completed calendar year;\n(3)  calculate the estimated city contribution rate for the following calendar year;\n(4)  determine the city contribution rate and the member contribution rate for the following calendar year, taking into account any adjustments required under Section 8.05, 8.06, or 8.065 of this Act, as applicable; and\n(5)  except as provided by Subsection (d) of this section, be based on the assumptions and methods adopted by the board in accordance with Section 3.091 of this Act, if applicable, and that are consistent with actuarial standards of practice and the following principles:\n(A)  closed layered amortization of liability layers to ensure that the amortization period for each liability layer begins 12 months after the date of the risk sharing valuation study in which the liability layer is first recognized;\n(B)  each liability layer is assigned an amortization period;\n(C)  each liability loss layer will be amortized over a period of 30 years from the first day of the calendar year beginning 12 months after the date of the risk sharing valuation study in which the liability loss layer is first recognized, except that the legacy liability must be amortized over a 30-year period beginning January 1, 2022;\n(D)  each liability gain layer will be amortized over:\n(i)  a period equal to the remaining amortization period on the largest remaining liability loss layer, and the two layers must be treated as one layer such that if the payoff year of the liability loss layer is accelerated or extended, the payoff year of the liability gain layer is also accelerated or extended; or\n(ii)  if there is no liability loss layer, a period of 30 years from the first day of the calendar year beginning 12 months after the date of the risk sharing valuation study in which the liability gain layer is first recognized;\n(E)  liability layers will be funded according to the level percent of payroll method;\n(F)  payroll for purposes of determining the corridor midpoint, city contribution rate, and city legacy contribution amount must be projected using the annual payroll growth rate assumption adopted by the board; and\n(G)  the city contribution rate will be calculated each calendar year without inclusion of the legacy liability.\n(c)  The city and the board may agree on a written transition plan for resetting the corridor midpoint:\n(1)  if at any time the funded ratio of the system is equal to or greater than 100 percent; or\n(2)  for any calendar year after the payoff year of the legacy liability.\n(d)  Subject to Section 3.091 of this Act, the board may by rule adopt actuarial principles other than those required under Subsection (b)(5) of this section, provided the actuarial principles:\n(1)  are consistent with actuarial standards of practice;\n(2)  are approved by the system's actuary; and\n(3)  do not operate to change the city legacy contribution amount.\nSec. 8.05.  ADJUSTMENT TO CITY CONTRIBUTION RATE IF LOWER THAN CORRIDOR MIDPOINT.  (a)  This section governs the determination of the city contribution rate applicable in a calendar year under Section 8.04(b)(4) of this Act if the estimated city contribution rate determined under Section 8.04(b)(3) of this Act is lower than the corridor midpoint.\n(b)  If the estimated city contribution rate is lower than the corridor midpoint and the funded ratio is:\n(1)  less than 90 percent, the city contribution rate for the applicable year equals the corridor midpoint; or\n(2)  equal to or greater than 90 percent and the city contribution rate is:\n(A)  equal to or greater than the minimum city contribution rate, the estimated city contribution rate is the city contribution rate for the calendar year; or\n(B)  less than the minimum city contribution rate for the corresponding calendar year, the city contribution rate for the calendar year equals the minimum city contribution rate.\n(c)  If the funded ratio is equal to or greater than 100 percent:\n(1)  all existing liability layers, including the legacy liability, are considered fully amortized and paid; and\n(2)  the city legacy contribution amount may no longer be included in the city contribution under Section 8.02 of this Act.\nSec. 8.06.  ADJUSTMENT TO CITY CONTRIBUTION RATE IF EQUAL TO OR GREATER THAN CORRIDOR MIDPOINT.  (a)  This section governs the determination of the city contribution rate applicable in a calendar year under Section 8.04(b)(4) of this Act if the estimated city contribution rate determined under Section 8.04(b)(3) of this Act is equal to or greater than the corridor midpoint.\n(b)  If the estimated city contribution rate is equal to or greater than the corridor midpoint and:\n(1)  less than or equal to the maximum city contribution rate for the corresponding calendar year, the estimated city contribution rate is the city contribution rate; or\n(2)  greater than the maximum city contribution rate for the corresponding calendar year, the city contribution rate is the maximum city contribution rate.\nSec. 8.065.  INCREASED MEMBER CONTRIBUTION RATE IF ESTIMATED CITY CONTRIBUTION RATE GREATER THAN MAXIMUM CITY CONTRIBUTION RATE.  (a)  This section governs the determination of the member contribution rate applicable in a calendar year under Section 8.04(b)(4) of this Act if the estimated city contribution rate determined under Section 8.04(b)(3) of this Act is greater than the maximum city contribution rate.\n(b)  Except as provided by Subsection (c) of this section, if the estimated city contribution rate is greater than the corridor maximum, the member contribution rate will increase by an amount equal to the difference between the following:\n(1)  the estimated city contribution rate; and\n(2)  the maximum city contribution rate.\n(c)  The member contribution rate may not be increased by more than two percentage points under this section.\n(d)  If the estimated city contribution rate is more than two percent of pensionable payroll greater than the maximum city contribution rate, the city and the board shall enter into discussions to determine additional funding solutions.\nSec. 8.07.  ADDITIONAL CITY CONTRIBUTIONS FOR PROPORTIONATE RETIREMENT PROGRAM PARTICIPATION.  (a)  The city shall contribute amounts in addition to the amounts described by Section 8.02 of this Act as required by Section 803.101(h), Government Code, to fund the additional liabilities incurred by the police retirement system as a result of participating in the proportionate retirement program.  The rate at which the city shall contribute additional amounts under this section is equal to 0.737 percent of the basic hourly earnings of each member employed by the city for all pay periods commencing on or after October 1, 2020, subject to adjustment under Subsection (b) of this section.\n(b)  The additional contribution rate under Subsection (a) of this section shall increase or decrease as considered necessary by the actuary for the police retirement system after each five-year period of participation by the system in the proportionate retirement program in order to update the amount necessary to fund the additional liabilities incurred by the system as a result of participating in the proportionate retirement program and of the consolidation of the city's public safety and emergency management department with the police department on January 4, 2009.  The system's actuary shall perform an experience study that shall be the basis for a contribution rate adjustment under this subsection.  The effective date of the initial contribution rate adjustment under this subsection is October 1, 2015.  Each later contribution rate adjustment under this subsection takes effect October 1 of every fifth year after the effective date of the initial contribution rate adjustment.  The system's actuary shall present to the police retirement board the experience study on which any contribution rate adjustment under this subsection is based not later than 45 days before the effective date of the adjustment, and the city's actuary shall have the opportunity to review and comment on the study.  An adjustment in the additional contribution rate under this subsection may not cause the additional contribution rate under Subsection (a) of this section to be less than zero.\nSec. 8.08.  PUBLICATION OF CHANGES TO CONTRIBUTION RATES. Any change of the rates of deposit and the rates of contribution shall be published when approved by the board.\nSec. 8.09.  EXPENSES.  (a) Expenses involved in administration and operation of the police retirement system shall be paid from the assets of the police retirement system subject to approval by the board. Such expenses shall include actuarial valuations of the system no less frequently than on a biennial basis, annual audits and/or actuarial studies, preparation of annual reports, and staff assistance.

Contributions made shall be treated as employer contributions in accordance with Section 414(h)(2), Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. Section 414(h)(2)), for the purpose of determining tax treatment of the amounts under the federal Internal Revenue Code.  These contributions are not includible in the gross income of the member until such time as they are distributed or made available to the member.\n(e)  Member contributions made as provided by Subsection (d) of this section shall be deposited to the individual account of each affected member and shall be treated as compensation of members for all other purposes of this Act and for the purpose of determining contributions to the federal Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance System (Social Security).  The provisions of this subsection shall remain in effect as long as the plan covering members is a qualified retirement plan under Section 401(a), Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. Section 401(a)), and its related trust is tax exempt under Section 501(a), Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. Section 501(a)).\nSec. 8.11.  EFFECT OF SYSTEM TERMINATION ON CONTRIBUTIONS. If the police retirement system is terminated, further contributions may not be made by the city or the system, and further deposits may not be made by the members for service after the date of termination.  Members do not accrue any additional benefits after the date of termination.  The benefit accrued by each member on the termination of the plan or the complete discontinuance of contributions under the plan and the benefit of any affected member on the partial termination of the plan, to the extent funded, become nonforfeitable notwithstanding the length of a member's service.  The benefit accrued by a member also becomes nonforfeitable, if not already nonforfeitable, at the normal retirement date.\nSec. 8.12.  EFFECT OF FORFEITURE. A forfeiture from a member terminating employment and withdrawing the member's accumulated deposits may not be applied to increase the benefit that any other member would receive from the system.  The actuary shall anticipate the effect of forfeitures in determining the costs under the system.\nSec. 8.13.  SYSTEM ASSETS. The assets of the police retirement system shall be held in trust for the exclusive benefit of the members and their beneficiaries.  The corpus or income may not be used for or diverted to a purpose other than the exclusive benefit of members or their beneficiaries, whether by operation or natural termination of the system, by power of revocation or amendment, by the happening of a contingency, by collateral arrangement, or by other means.\nARTICLE IX\nSec. 9.01. INVESTMENTS OF THE BOARD.    (a)  The police retirement board shall be the trustee of the funds of the police retirement system and shall have full power in its sole discretion to invest and reinvest, alter, and change such funds.  The board shall invest the funds in whatever instruments or investments the board considers prudent.  In making investments for the system, the board shall discharge its duties:\n(1) for the exclusive purposes of:\n(A) providing benefits to members and their beneficiaries;  and\n(B) defraying reasonable expenses of administering the system;\n(2) with the care, skill, prudence, and diligence under the circumstances then prevailing that a prudent person acting in a like capacity and familiar with such matters would use in the conduct of an enterprise of a like character and with like aims;\n(3) by diversifying the investments of the system to minimize the risk of large losses, unless under the circumstances it is clearly prudent not to do so;  and\n(4) in accordance with the laws, documents, and instruments governing the system.\n(b) No member of the board, except as herein provided, shall have any interest in, directly or indirectly, or receive any pay or emolument for the member's services.  No member of the board shall, directly or indirectly, for himself or as an agent in any manner use the funds or deposits of the police retirement system except to make the current and necessary payments authorized by the board;  nor shall any member of the board become an endorser or surety or in any manner an obligor for money loaned by or borrowed from the board.\n(c) None of the funds or money mentioned in this Act shall be assignable.  None of the funds or money mentioned in this Act shall be subject to execution, levy, attachment, garnishment, or other legal process.\n(d) The right of a member to a retirement benefit, the return of accumulated deposits, the payment of a RETRO DROP lump sum, or any other right accrued or accruing to any person under the provisions of this Act, and the money in the trust created by this Act shall be unassignable except as specifically provided in this Act and shall not be subject to execution, levy, attachment, garnishment, the operation of bankruptcy or insolvency law, or any other process of law whatsoever.\n(e) Service retirement benefits, disability retirement benefits, survivor benefits, death benefits, and withdrawal benefits may be paid to a former spouse or other alternate payee under the terms of a domestic relations order, but only if the board determines that the order constitutes a qualified domestic relations order within the meaning of Chapter 804, Government Code.  Benefit payments may be made to alternate payees only when and to the extent permitted by the qualified domestic relations order.  The amount of any benefit payment under this Act made to an alternate payee under a qualified domestic relations order shall reduce and offset the amount otherwise payable to the member or other beneficiary under this Act.  On the death of an alternate payee under a qualified domestic relations order, the interest of the alternate payee in the benefits under this Act ends, and remaining benefits shall be paid as if the qualified domestic relations order had not existed.\nARTICLE X\nSec. 10.01. FALSE REPORT OR STATEMENT.  Whoever with intent to deceive shall make any statement or report required under this Act which is untrue or shall falsify or permit to be falsified any record or records of the police retirement system shall forfeit any office or rights held by the person under the system, and such deception, falsification, or acquiescence in falsification shall be deemed a misdemeanor and the violation thereof shall be punishable by a fine not to exceed $1,000.\nSec. 10.02. CORRECTION OF ERRORS.  If any change or error in the records of the police retirement system should be discovered or should result in any member, retired member, surviving spouse, or beneficiary receiving from the police retirement system more or less than such member, retired member, surviving spouse, or beneficiary would have been entitled to receive had the records been correct, the police retirement board shall have the power to correct such error.  Except as provided by Section 802.1024, Government Code, the retirement system shall, as far as possible, adjust the payments so that the actuarial equivalent of the benefits to which the member, retired member, surviving spouse, or beneficiary was correctly entitled shall be paid.\nARTICLE XI\nSec. 11.01.  LIMITATION ON PAYMENT OF BENEFITS.  (a)  If the amount of any benefit payment otherwise due under this Act or the total payments due under this Act and any other qualified defined benefit plan maintained by this city would exceed the limitations provided by Section 415(b), Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the regulations adopted under that section, the police retirement system shall reduce the amount of the benefit paid under this Act as required to comply with that section.  If the annual additions that would otherwise be allocated under this Act, or the total annual additions under this Act and any other qualified plan maintained by the city would exceed the limits under Section 415(c), Internal Revenue Code of 1986, the annual additions under this Act shall be reduced to the extent required to comply with Section 415(c), Internal Revenue Code of 1986.\n(b)  For purposes of determining if the benefits or annual additions satisfy the limits provided by Subsection (a) of this section, the compensation to be used is wages within the meaning of Section 3401(a), Internal Revenue Code of 1986, plus amounts deferred at the election of the member that would be included in wages if not deferred under the rules of Section 402(e)(3), 125(a), 132(f)(4), 457(b), 402(h)(1)(B), or 402(k), Internal Revenue Code of 1986.  However, any rules that would limit the remuneration included in wages based on the nature or location of the employment or the services performed are disregarded for purposes of determining compensation.  In addition, any wages paid after a severance from employment are not included as compensation for purposes  of this subsection unless the payment is for regular pay as described in 26 C.F.R. Section 1.415(c)-2(e)(3)(ii) and is made by the later of two and one-half months after the severance from employment or the end of the calendar year that includes the date of severance from employment.  If excess annual additions are made to any member's account despite the efforts of the board of trustees, the amount shall be treated in accordance with 26 C.F.R. Section 1.402(g)-1(e)(2) or (3).\n(c)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, the applicable mortality table for purposes of adjusting a benefit due to the limitations provided under Section 415(b)(2)(B) or (D), Internal Revenue Code of 1986, is the table prescribed by Revenue Ruling 2001-62.\nARTICLE XII\nSec. 12.01. DISTRIBUTION RULES FOR SERVICE RETIREMENT AND DEATH ANNUITY PAYMENTS.    (a)  If a member selects, or if a member's death before retirement results in the payment of, an optional annuity providing for payment of a fixed number of monthly payments to the member's beneficiary or estate if the member dies before the total number of payments has been completed, the option is limited as provided by Subsections (b), (c), (d), and (e) of this section.\n(b) If, according to mortality tables adopted by the Internal Revenue Service, at the time of the member's retirement the joint life expectancy of the member making the selection and of the beneficiary is less than the minimum period that monthly payments would be required under the option selected, the member must select another option so that the minimum period that monthly payments would be required does not exceed the joint life expectancy of the person making the selection and of the beneficiary.\n(c) If, according to mortality tables adopted by the Internal Revenue Service, the life expectancy of a person to whom a benefit will be paid as the result of a member's death before retirement is less at the time of the member's death than the minimum period that monthly payments would be required under the option selected, the system shall adjust the minimum period that monthly payments will be required to a period that is not less than 60 months and that is the greatest multiple of 12 months that does not exceed the life expectancy of the person to whom the benefit will be paid.  The amount of the monthly payment shall be adjusted to the actuarial equivalent of the payments that would be made for the greater number of months.\n(d) If the member making the selection designates the member's estate as beneficiary and if, according to mortality tables adopted by the Internal Revenue Service, the life expectancy of that member is less than the minimum period that monthly payments would be required under the option selected, the member must select another option so that the minimum period that monthly payments would be required does not exceed the member's life expectancy at the time of the member's retirement.\n(e) If an estate will be paid monthly benefits as the result of a member's death before retirement for a period that would exceed 60 months, the period for which the payments will be made shall be reduced to 60 months, and the amount of the monthly payment to the estate is the actuarial equivalent of the payments that would have been made for the greater number of months.\n(f) If a member selects an optional annuity that is payable after the retiree's death throughout the life of a beneficiary who is not the retiree's spouse, payments to the beneficiary after the retiree's death may not exceed the applicable percentage of the annuity payment that would have been payable to the retiree using the following table:\n(g) Unless the member's spouse is the beneficiary of an optional annuity that guarantees a fixed number of monthly payments, the guaranteed number of payments may not exceed the applicable period using the following table:\nSec. 12.02. DISTRIBUTION RULES FOR DISABILITY ANNUITY PAYMENTS.

TRANSFER OF ELIGIBLE ROLLOVER DISTRIBUTIONS.    (a)  Notwithstanding any provision of this Act to the contrary that would otherwise limit a distributee's election under this section, a distributee may elect, at the time and in the manner prescribed by the board, to have any portion of an eligible rollover distribution paid directly to an eligible retirement plan specified by the distributee in a direct rollover.\n(b) In this section:\n(1) \"Eligible rollover distribution\" means any distribution of all or any portion of the balance to the credit of the distributee, except that an eligible rollover distribution does not include:\n(A) any distribution that is one of a series of substantially equal periodic payments made at least annually for the life or life expectancy of the distributee or the joint lives or joint life expectancies of the distributee and distributee's beneficiary, or for a specified period of 10 years or more;\n(B) any distribution to the extent the distribution is required under Section 401(a)(9) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (26 U.S.C.

The board shall set the rate of interest.\n(g) Repealed by Acts 2003, 78th Leg., ch. 513, Sec. 10.\n(h) A municipality to which this Act applies shall double-match payments made to the fund under this section.\nSec. 4.04.

The member's retirement annuity shall be computed in the manner provided by Section 5.01 of this Act, except that the amount of service credit and average total salary used in making that computation shall be determined in accordance with this subsection.  For purposes of this subsection, the member's average total salary shall be computed based on the member's Back DROP retirement date, which is the member's actual retirement date less the amount of time the member elects under Subsection (b)(1) of this section.  For purposes of this subsection, the member's service credit shall be the member's service credit determined in accordance with Section 5.01(g) of this Act less the amount of time for:\n(1)  any service credit in excess of 34 years of service, other than service credit for sick leave unused on the date of actual retirement;\n(2)  any service credit given for sick leave unused on the date of actual retirement; and\n(3)  any service credit in excess of 20 years but not in excess of the amount permitted under Subsection (b)(1) of this section that the member elects for computing the amount of the lump-sum payment.\n(d-1)  The member's retirement annuity as computed under Subsection (d) of this section shall be divided by 12 to compute the member's monthly pension to be used to compute the lump-sum payment.  The member's monthly pension multiplied by the number of full months elected by the member under Subsection (b)(1) of this section is the amount of the lump-sum payment to which the member is entitled.\n(e)  For purposes of computing the monthly pension of a member making a Back DROP election, the member's retirement annuity shall be computed in the manner provided by Section 5.01 of this Act, except that:\n(1)  the amount of service credit used in making that computation shall be the member's service credit determined in accordance with Section 5.01(g) of this Act less:\n(A)  the amount of time the member elects under Subsection (b)(1) of this section; and\n(B)  any service credit in excess of 34 years of service excluding any service credit for sick leave unused on the date of actual retirement; and\n(2)  the member's average total salary shall be computed as if the member's retirement date were the member's actual retirement date less the amount of time the member elects under Subsection (b)(1) of this section.\n(e-1)  The annuity computed under Subsection (e) of this section may not exceed the applicable limitations provided by Section 5.01 of this Act.  The member's retirement annuity shall be divided by 12 to compute the member's monthly pension.\n(f) A member may defer receiving the lump-sum payment under this section for a period of not longer than 12 months after the member's retirement date.

(a)  The board may cause a disability retiree to undergo a medical examination or examinations by any reputable physician or physicians selected by the board.\n(a-1)  A disability retiree who is awarded a catastrophic injury disability annuity under Section 5.03(a-1) of this Act shall undergo a medical examination by any reputable physician or physicians selected by the board:\n(1)  not later than 60 months after the date of the award of the annuity by the board; and\n(2)  thereafter, not later than 60 months following the last required medical examination of the disability retiree under this subsection.\n(a-2)  The board may require one or more medical examinations under Subsection (a) of this section in addition to those required under Subsection (a-1) of this section.\n(a-3)  Subject to Subsection (c) of this section, based on an examination under Subsections (a), (a-1), or (a-2) of this section, the board shall determine whether the disability retirement annuity shall be continued, decreased, restored to the original amount if it had been decreased, or discontinued.\n(b) For those retired because of disability before August 30, 1971, the board may change the disability retirement annuity provided by this Act, in accordance with any change in the degree of disability, except that the percentage used to compute the annuity may not, except in the case of discontinuance, be reduced to less than 2.25 percent of the base pay of a private each month, for each year that the retiree has served and contributed a portion of salary as provided by this Act, based on the greater of:\n(1) the rate of pay at the time of the original granting of the disability retirement annuity;  or\n(2) a minimum base pay of $200 each month.\n(c)  For those retired because of disability on or after August 30, 1971, the disability retirement annuity may not be reduced to an amount that is less than the product of:\n(1)  2.25 percent multiplied by the number of years that the retiree served in the department and contributed a portion of salary as a member of the fund multiplied by the retiree's average total salary, if the retiree served three years or more before the date of retirement;\n(2)  2.25 percent multiplied by the number of years that the retiree served in the department and contributed a portion of salary as a member of the fund multiplied by the retiree's average monthly salary as of the date of retirement multiplied by 12, if the retiree served at least two months and less than three years before the date of retirement; or\n(3)  2.25 percent multiplied by the number of years that the retiree served in the department and contributed a portion of salary as a member of the fund multiplied by the retiree's average daily salary as of the date of retirement multiplied by 360, if the member has served less than two months before the date of retirement.\n(c-1)  In making the computation under Subsection (c) of this section, all fractional years shall be prorated based on full months served in the department as a contributing member of the fund before the date of retirement.\n(d) If a disability retiree, after notice, fails to undergo a medical examination as provided by this section, the board may reduce or entirely discontinue the retiree's disability annuity payments.\nSec. 5.06. REMOVAL OF DISABILITY AND WAIVER ON REINSTATEMENT.    (a)  If a disability retiree applies for reinstatement to the department from which that person retired, the disability retiree, in addition to complying with any applicable civil service laws, shall file a written application with the board for a discontinuance of that person's disability retirement annuity, subject to medical examination, indicating that the person has recovered from the disability for which that person has been receiving disability retirement annuity payments and certifying to the board that the chief of the department from which that person was retired approves that person's reinstatement.\n(b) The applicant must execute a waiver on a form prescribed by the board in which the applicant waives a second disability retirement annuity resulting from the same disability that was the basis of the first disability at a higher rate than the applicant was receiving at the time of the reinstatement for a period of three years after reinstatement.  After three years of reinstated service, any subsequent disability retirement annuity is computed as any other disability retirement annuity.\n(c) If the applicant is required to undergo retraining and is compensated during a period before being officially reinstated, the applicant's monthly disability retirement annuity shall be reduced by the amount of any monthly departmental payroll benefit, to the extent that the latter is greater.\n(d) The board may approve the discontinuance of a disability retirement annuity as provided by this Act.\nSec. 5.07. OUTSIDE INCOME PENSION REDUCTION.    (a)  The board shall require each disability retiree retiring after August 29, 1979, to provide the board annually not later than May 1 of each year with a true and complete copy of the retiree's income tax return for the previous year, except for a retiree who is 65 years of age or older as of December 31 of the previous year.\n(b)  If the retiree received income from other employment, including self-employment, during the preceding year, the board may reduce the retiree's disability retirement annuity by the amount of $1 for each month for each $2 of income earned by the retiree from the other employment during each month of the previous year, except that the disability retirement annuity may not be decreased below the amount determined under Section 5.05(c) of this Act.\nSec. 5.08. REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION.    (a)  A disability retirement annuity may not be granted or continued if the chief of the member's department will provide the member employment within the department commensurate with that person's physical and mental capabilities.\n(b) A determination under this section is solely within the discretion of the department chief and must be reasonably exercised.\nSec. 5.09. COST-OF-LIVING INCREASES.    (a)  At or before its regular meeting in the month of March, the board annually shall review the Consumer's Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U), U.S. City Average or the nearest equivalent published by the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics for the preceding calendar year.  If that index shows an increase during the preceding calendar year in the cost of living as compared with that index at the close of the previous year, the board shall order an increase of all service, disability, and death benefit retirement annuities by a percentage that varies by the date of the member's service or disability retirement, or, in the case of a member who died before retirement, the date on which the member died.  If the member's service retirement, disability retirement, or death before retirement occurred before August 30, 1971, the annuity shall be increased by a percentage equal to the percentage increase in the cost of living index.  If the member's service retirement, disability retirement, or death before retirement occurred on or after August 30, 1971, but before October 1, 1999, the annuity shall be increased as follows:  if the percentage increase in the cost of living index is eight percent or less, the annuity shall be increased by a percentage equal to the percentage increase, and if the percentage increase in the cost of living index is more than eight percent, the annuity shall be increased by eight percent plus a percentage equal to 75 percent of the percentage increase that is more than eight percent.  If the member's service retirement, disability retirement, or death before retirement occurred on or after October 1, 1999, the annuity shall be increased by a percentage equal to 75 percent of the percentage increase in the cost of living index.  A percentage increase in annuities shall be rounded to the nearest one-tenth percentage point for a cost of living increase.\n(a-1)  The cost of living increases described by this section do not apply to an annuity payable under Section 6.02(g-3) of this Act until the annuity becomes effective.\n(b) The annuities to which this section applies shall be computed as of the month of January before that March board meeting and shall continue in effect for at least one full year until there has been an additional increase to that cost-of-living index and the board enters another order as provided by this section.\n(c) The cost-of-living increase paid to any retiree or beneficiary during the first full year after the effective date of the service retirement, disability retirement, or death shall be prorated on the basis of full months from the date of the member's service retirement, disability retirement, or death.\nSec. 5.10. COORDINATION WITH FEDERAL LAW.    (a)  A member or beneficiary of a member of the fund may not accrue a service retirement annuity, disability retirement annuity, death benefit, whether death occurs in the line of duty or otherwise, or any other benefit under this Act in excess of the benefit limits applicable to the fund under Section 415 of the code.  The board shall reduce the amount of any benefit that exceeds those limits by the amount of the excess.  If the total benefits under this fund and the benefits and contributions to which any member is entitled under any other qualified defined benefit plan maintained by the municipality that employs the member would otherwise exceed the applicable limits under Section 415 of the code, the benefits the member would otherwise receive from the fund shall be reduced to the extent necessary to enable the benefits to comply with Section 415 of the code.\n(b) Any member or beneficiary who is entitled to receive any distribution that is an eligible rollover distribution as defined by Section 402(c)(4) of the code is entitled to have that distribution transferred directly to another eligible retirement plan of the member's or beneficiary's choice on providing direction to the fund regarding that transfer in accordance with procedures established by the board.\n(c) The total salary taken into account for any purpose for any member of the fund may not exceed $200,000 per year for an eligible participant or $150,000 per year for an ineligible participant.  These dollar limits shall be periodically adjusted in accordance with guidelines provided by the United States secretary of the treasury.  For purposes of this subsection, an eligible participant is any person who first became a member before 1996, and an ineligible participant is any member who is not an eligible participant.\n(d) Accrued benefits under this Act become 100 percent vested for a member on:\n(1) the date the member has completed 20 years of service;\n(2) the earlier termination or partial termination of the pension plan created by this Act, if it affects the member;  or\n(3) the complete discontinuance of contributions by the municipality to the fund.\n(e) Amounts representing forfeited nonvested benefits of terminated members may not be used to increase benefits payable from the fund but may be used to reduce contributions for future plan years.\n(f) Distribution of benefits must begin not later than April 1 of the year following the calendar year during which the member becomes 70-1/2 years of age and must otherwise conform to Section 401(a)(9) of the code.\n(g) If the amount of any benefit is to be determined on the basis of actuarial assumptions that are not otherwise specifically set forth for that purpose in this Act, the actuarial assumptions to be used are those earnings and mortality assumptions being used on the date of the determination by the fund's actuary and approved by the board.  The actuarial assumptions being used at any particular time shall be attached as an addendum to a copy of this Act and treated for all purposes as a part of this Act.  The actuarial assumptions may be changed by the fund's actuary at any time if approved by the board, but a change in actuarial assumptions may not result in any decrease in benefits accrued as of the effective date of the change.\n(h) This section applies to any benefit regardless of when accrued.\n(i) The board may adopt rules to administer this section.  A rule adopted by the board under this subsection is final and binding.\n(j) To the extent permitted by law, the board may adjust the benefits of retired members and beneficiaries by increasing any retirement benefit that was reduced because of Section 415 of the code.  If Section 415 of the code is amended to permit the payment of amounts previously precluded under Section 415 of the code, the board may adjust the benefits of retired members and beneficiaries, including the restoration of benefits previously denied.  Benefits paid under this subsection are not considered as extra compensation earned after retirement but as the delayed payment of benefits earned before retirement.\n(k) The board by rule shall implement this Act in a manner that preserves the tax qualification of the fund under the code and may revise any provision or program to the extent necessary to retain tax qualification.\n(l) In this section, \"qualified plan\" has the meaning assigned by Section 8.02 of this Act.\nSec. 5.11. 13TH CHECK FOR RETIREES.    (a)  In any fiscal year ending after 1996 for which the board determines that the average annual investment yield on the market value of fund investments for the preceding five fiscal years exceeded the annual investment yield projected by the actuary for that preceding five-fiscal-year period by at least 100 basis points, the board may authorize the disbursement of a 13th pension check.\n(b) The 13th pension check is paid to each retiree who is entitled to receive an annuity in the last month of the fiscal year preceding the fiscal year in which the check is disbursed and is in an amount equal to the amount of the annuity payment made in the last month of the preceding fiscal year, except the amount of any such check shall be prorated for any retiree who has been receiving an annuity for less than one year so that the amount of the check is one-twelfth of the check that would have been paid to the retiree receiving an annuity for a full year times the number of full months an annuity has been paid.\n(c) Authorization of a 13th check for any year is subject to the discretion of the board.  Authorization for one year does not obligate the board to authorize a 13th check for any other year.  The 13th check shall be paid as the board directs.\n(d) In this section, \"annual investment yield\" means the yield on the fund's investment portfolio for a particular year, as a percentage of the portfolio, after reduction for costs of investing the portfolio, but without reduction for the fund's operating expenses.\nSec. 5.12. 14TH CHECK FOR RETIREES.    (a)  In this section, \"annual investment yield\" has the meaning assigned by Section 5.11(d) of this Act.\n(b) In a fiscal year ending after September 1, 2000, for which the board determines that the average annual investment yield on the market value of fund investments for the preceding five fiscal years exceeded the annual investment yield projected by the actuary for that five-fiscal-year period by at least 300 basis points, the board may authorize the disbursement of a 14th pension check.\n(c) The 14th pension check is paid to each retiree who is entitled to receive an annuity in the last month of the fiscal year preceding the fiscal year in which the check is disbursed.  Except as provided by Subsection (d) of this section, the check is in an amount equal to the amount of the annuity payment made in the last month of the preceding fiscal year.\n(d) For a retiree who has received an annuity for less than one year, the amount of the 14th pension check is prorated so that the amount of the check is one-twelfth of the check that would have been paid to a retiree receiving an annuity for a full year times the number of full months an annuity has been paid.\n(e) Authorization of a 14th check for any year is subject to the discretion of the board.  Authorization for one year does not obligate the board to authorize a 14th check for any other year.  The 14th check shall be paid as the board directs.\nARTICLE 6. BENEFICIARY'S BENEFITS\nSec. 6.01. MEMBER'S BENEFICIARY AND DEPENDENT CHILD'S RIGHTS.    (a)  A member of the fund has, in addition to all rights accruing from the person's membership, the same right to receive benefits as a beneficiary that a nonmember who is a beneficiary has in similar circumstances if the member's spouse also is a member of the fund.\n(b) A dependent child is entitled to receive benefits based on the service of any parent who is a member of the fund.\nSec. 6.02. DEATH BENEFIT ANNUITY FOR SURVIVING SPOUSES AND CHILDREN.    (a)  Subject to Section 6.03 of this Act and the provisions of this section, if a member or retiree receiving a disability pension under Section 5.03(a) of this Act dies leaving a surviving spouse or at least one dependent child, the surviving spouse and the children are entitled to receive from the fund an aggregate death benefit annuity, computed and payable from the date of the member's death.  The surviving spouse may elect the annuity in an amount that is equal to either:\n(1)  50 percent of the member's average total salary; or\n(2)  the same percentage of the member's average total salary that the member would have been entitled to receive as a retirement annuity if the member could have retired on the date of death.\n(b) The amount of a death benefit annuity computed under Subsection (a) of this section may not exceed the service retirement annuity to which a member with the same average total salary and with 27 years of service credit would be entitled.\n(c)  Subject to the provisions of this section, if a retiree other than a retiree receiving a disability pension under Section 5.03(a) of this Act dies leaving a surviving spouse or at least one dependent child, the surviving spouse and dependent children are entitled to receive from the fund an aggregate death benefit annuity, computed and payable from the date of the member's death, in an amount that is equal to the lesser of:\n(1)  the retirement annuity to which a member with the same average total salary as the deceased retiree and 27 years of service credit would be entitled if the member retired on the date of the deceased retiree's death; or\n(2)  the retirement annuity the retiree was receiving at the time of the retiree's death.\n(d)  Subject to Subsection (d-2) of this section, if, at the time a death benefit annuity becomes payable under Subsection (a) or (c) of this section, the deceased member or retiree leaves a surviving spouse and at least one dependent child, the board shall award:\n(1)  75 percent of the annuity to the surviving spouse; and\n(2)  25 percent of the annuity:\n(A)  to the dependent child, if there is only one; or\n(B)  if there is more than one dependent child, in equal shares to each child.\n(d-1)  The allocation of an annuity under Subsection (d) of this section is effective as to all annuities payable by the fund as of October 1, 2009, that are payable in part to a surviving spouse and in part to one or more surviving children.  This subsection applies only to benefits payable by the fund after September 30, 2009, and does not affect benefits paid or payable by the fund before October 1, 2009.\n(d-2)  If, at the time a death benefit annuity becomes payable under Subsection (a) or (c) of this section, a deceased member or retiree leaves a surviving spouse who is not entitled to an annuity on the date of death under Subsection (g-1) of this section and one or more dependent children, the dependent child or children shall be awarded 100 percent of the death benefit annuity until the annuity to the surviving spouse becomes effective under Subsection (g-3) of this section.\n(e) If, at the time a death benefit annuity under Subsection (a) or (c) of this section becomes payable, the deceased leaves a surviving spouse and no dependent child, the board shall award the annuity to the surviving spouse.\n(f) If, at the time a death benefit annuity under Subsection (a) or (c) of this section becomes payable, the deceased leaves no surviving spouse and at least one dependent child, the board shall award the annuity:\n(1) to the dependent child, if there is only one;  or\n(2) if there is more than one child, in equal shares to each child.\n(g)  A child who is born after the date of retirement of the member is not entitled to a death benefit annuity under this Act unless the retiree was married to the other parent of the child on the date of retirement.  A surviving spouse of a retiree whose status as a surviving spouse resulted from a marriage after the date of the retirement of the retiree is entitled to receive only the benefits, if any, provided under Subsection (g-1) of this section or Section 6.08 of this Act.\n(g-1)  Subject to Subsection (g-3) of this section, a surviving spouse of a retiree whose status as a surviving spouse resulted from a marriage after the date of the retirement of the retiree is entitled to receive the entire death benefit of a surviving spouse in this section if the surviving spouse was married to the retiree for a period of at least the five consecutive years preceding the date of the retiree's death.  A surviving spouse of a retiree whose status as a surviving spouse resulted from a marriage after the date of the retirement of the retiree and was not married to the retiree for a period of the five consecutive years preceding the date of the retiree's death is entitled to receive only the benefits, if any, provided under Section 6.08 of this Act.  The benefit provided by this subsection applies only with respect to a retiree death that occurs on or after October 1, 2007.\n(g-2)  The surviving spouse of a retiree who made an election under Subsection (m) of this section before October 1, 2007, and who does not cancel that election in accordance with Subsection (m) of this section is not entitled to receive the death benefit annuity provided for under Subsection (g-1) of this section.\n(g-3)  The death benefit to which a surviving spouse is entitled under Subsection (g-1) of this section as a result of a retiree's death that occurs on or after October 1, 2009, is payable by the fund on the date of the retiree's death if the surviving spouse is 55 years of age or older on the date of the retiree's death.  If the surviving spouse is not 55 years of age or older on the date of the retiree's death, the annuity shall be payable by the fund on the date the surviving spouse reaches age 55.  A surviving spouse who is not 55 years of age or older on the date of the retiree's death is not entitled to benefits from the fund during the period beginning on the date of the retiree's death and ending on the date the surviving spouse reaches age 55.\n(h) If a member or retiree dies leaving a surviving spouse and at least one dependent child, the death benefit annuity payable to the surviving spouse shall be increased as of the day no child is entitled to receive benefits to the amount the spouse would have received had there been no dependent child.\n(i) If a member or retiree dies leaving a surviving spouse and at least one dependent child, the death benefit annuity payable to the dependent children shall be increased as of the day the surviving spouse dies to the amount the children would have received had there been no surviving spouse.\n(j) A dependent child as defined by Section 1.02(7)(B) of this Act has the same rights as a dependent child as defined by Section 1.02(7)(A) of this Act, except that any death benefit annuity paid under this subsection to a dependent child as defined by Section 1.02(7)(B) of this Act may, at the discretion of the board, be reduced to the extent of any state pension or aid, including Medicaid, or any state-funded assistance received by the child, regardless of whether the funds were made available to the state by the federal government.  In no other instance under this Act is a child entitled to any benefit after becoming 18 years of age.\n(k) The board shall increase a death benefit annuity payable on October 1, 1999, to a dependent child or children who do not have a living parent on that date to the entire amount of the death benefit annuity that would have been awarded had the retiree or member died leaving no surviving spouse if a surviving spouse of the member or retiree is not entitled to receive benefits from the fund on October 1, 1999.\n(l) A former spouse of a deceased member or retiree who is not the spouse of the member or retiree on the date of death of the member or retiree is not entitled to a benefit under this section.\n(m)  Subject to Subsections (n) and (o) of this section, a service retiree who marries after the date of retirement may elect to receive a reduced annuity during the retiree's lifetime and provide for a death benefit annuity to the retiree's surviving spouse.  The amount of the reduced annuity and spousal death benefit shall be determined by the fund's actuary and shall be actuarially equivalent to the annuity the retiree was receiving immediately before the election under this subsection.  An election made under this subsection may be canceled by the retiree before the retiree's death.  After the election is canceled, the retiree shall be entitled to receive the same annuity to which the retiree would have been entitled if the election had not been made.  A retiree who cancels an election under this subsection is not entitled to any additional benefits for the period of time before the cancellation.  The board shall adopt policies and procedures governing elections and cancellation of elections under this subsection.  An election or cancellation of an election made under this subsection must be made in accordance with the board's policies and procedures.\n(n)  A retiree may not make an election under Subsection (m) of this section at a time in which there are one or more dependent children of the retiree who would be entitled to a death benefit under this section on the death of the retiree.\n(o)  A retiree may not make an election under Subsection (m) of this section after September 30, 2007.  A cancellation of an election by a retiree under Subsection (m) of this section must be made on or before December 31, 2007.\nSec. 6.03. DEATH BENEFIT ANNUITY FOR SPOUSE OF MEMBER KILLED IN LINE OF DUTY.    (a)  The death benefit annuity of a surviving spouse of a member of the fund who is killed in the line of duty is governed by this section.\n(b) The board shall consider the finding of a municipality to which this Act applies that a member was killed in the line of duty as a guideline for its determination in applying this section.  On an application for survivor's benefits by a surviving spouse or dependent child, the fund shall pay the normal benefits payable under Section 6.02 of this Act.  When a benefit is payable under this section, the death benefit annuity shall be recomputed, applying Subsection (c) of this section, and any deficiency payment shall be paid to the eligible beneficiaries.\n(c) Notwithstanding the formulas for computing the total amounts of annuities otherwise provided by this Act, if a member is killed in the line of duty, the member's surviving spouse and dependent children are entitled to a death benefit annuity equal to the total salary of the member at the time of death.  Rules provided by this section relating to qualification and disqualification for and apportionment of benefits apply to a death benefit annuity computed under this subsection.  A death benefit annuity computed under this subsection is divided in the manner described by Section 6.02 of this Act and is subject to the same cost-of-living adjustments that apply to pensions for service retirement.\nSec. 6.04. REMARRIAGE;  BENEFITS AFTER TERMINATION OF MARRIAGE.    (a)  The right of a surviving spouse or dependent child to annuity payments under this Act is not affected by the surviving spouse's remarriage or dependent child's marriage under either statutory or common law if the marriage or remarriage takes place on or after October 1, 1995.\n(b) If after October 1, 1995, there is a termination of the remarriage of a surviving spouse or of the marriage of a dependent child, that person is entitled, on application, to 100 percent of the annuity that was in effect on the date of termination of benefits.\n(c) A surviving spouse or dependent child who is unmarried but receiving reduced benefits because of a prior marriage that caused the benefits to be terminated is entitled to 100 percent of the annuity that was in effect on the original date of termination of benefits.\n(d) The benefit provided under Subsections (b) and (c) of this section shall be provided prospectively beginning October 1, 1995, and the surviving spouse or dependent child is not entitled to receive any benefits or increases in benefits relating to any period before October 1, 1995.\nSec. 6.05. AFFIDAVIT OF MARITAL STATUS.    (a)  A surviving spouse, a dependent child, or the guardian of a surviving spouse or dependent child may be required by the board to file an affidavit concerning the person's marital status or the marital status of the person's wards in any case in which marriage could affect the benefits of the surviving spouse or dependent child.\n(b) If the surviving spouse, dependent child, or guardian fails or refuses to file an affidavit required under Subsection (a) of this section or if an incomplete, incorrect, or false affidavit is filed, the board may suspend annuity payments to that person indefinitely until the person complies with the requests and orders of the board.\nSec. 6.06.  COMMON-LAW MARRIAGES.  Common-law marriages are not recognized under this Act and benefits may not be conferred on common-law spouses as beneficiaries unless a declaration of informal marriage was made and recorded under Sections 2.402 and 2.404, Family Code, and their subsequent amendments, or any successor statutes, before the member's death.\nSec. 6.07. SURVIVING SPOUSE'S RIGHT TO SINGLE ENTITLEMENT.  A surviving spouse, whether or not a member of the fund, is not entitled to more than one death benefit annuity from the fund.  A surviving spouse who has been married to more than one deceased member or retiree is entitled to receive a death benefit annuity with respect to the deceased member or retiree that will provide the highest benefit.\nSec. 6.08. LUMP-SUM DEATH BENEFIT.\n(a)  Except as provided by Subsection (b) of this section, a surviving spouse of a retiree whose status as such resulted from any marriage after the date of the retirement of the retiree and who has been married to the retiree for a period of less than the five consecutive years preceding the date of the retiree's death, is entitled to a lump-sum death benefit because of the retiree's death in the amount of $15,000.\n(b)  A surviving spouse is not entitled to a lump-sum death benefit under this section if a child is entitled to receive death benefits under this Act as a result of the retiree's death.\n(c)  Repealed by Acts 2007, 80th Leg., R.S., Ch. 1416, Sec. 17, eff. October 1, 2007.\nSec. 6.09. DEATH BENEFIT ANNUITIES TO DEPENDENT PARENTS.    (a)  If a contributing member in good standing of the fire or police department or a retiree dies before or after retirement and leaves no surviving spouse or child but leaves surviving a father and mother wholly dependent on that person for support, the dependent father and mother are entitled to receive one-third of the average total salary of the deceased member based on the same number of years of the member's pay as is currently provided for computations of retirement annuities under Section 5.01 of this Act, the annuity to be equally divided between the father and mother as long as they are wholly dependent.  If there is only one dependent, either father or mother, the board shall grant the surviving dependent an annuity not to exceed one-fourth that average total salary as computed under this subsection.\n(b) An application for benefits under Subsection (a) of this section must be accompanied by a copy of the deceased member's or retiree's tax return filed for the last year ending before the member's or retiree's death or an explanation satisfactory to the board of why the tax return cannot be provided.  The board may, on its own initiative, make a thorough investigation, determine the facts as to the dependency with respect to an application for benefits made under Subsection (a) of this section, and at any time, on the request of any beneficiary or any contributor to the fund, reopen any award made to any member or dependent of any member who is receiving annuity payments under this section and discontinue those payments as to all or any of them.  The findings of the board under this section and all annuities granted under this section are final on all parties unless set aside or revoked by a court of competent jurisdiction.\nSec. 6.10. SUSPENSION RIGHTS.  If a member dies who is under suspension at the time of death, including an indefinite suspension that has not become final, the member's beneficiaries have the same rights as the beneficiaries of any other member under this Act.\nSec. 6.11.  DEATH BENEFIT FOR ACTIVE MEMBER'S ESTATE.  If an active member dies and does not leave a beneficiary, the estate of the deceased member is entitled to a death benefit payment from the fund in an amount equal to the greater of:\n(1)  10 times the amount of an annuity computed in accordance with Section 5.01(f-1) of this Act using the deceased member's service credit and average total salary as of the date of death; or\n(2)  the refund of the member's contributions that were picked up by the municipality.\nSec. 6.115.

LUMP-SUM PAYMENT ELECTION FOR SURVIVING SPOUSES.    (a)  A surviving spouse of a member who is entitled to receive a death benefit under Section 6.02 of this Act may elect to receive a portion of the benefit in a lump-sum payment under this section.\n(b) The lump-sum payment may be elected only by a surviving spouse:\n(1) of a member who, on the date of death, is eligible:\n(A) for service retirement;  and\n(B) to elect a Backward Deferred Retirement Option Plan;  and\n(2) who elects to receive a death benefit under Section 6.02(a)(2) of this Act.\n(c) If a member is killed in the line of duty and the deceased member's surviving spouse is entitled to a death benefit annuity under Section 6.03 of this Act, the surviving spouse may not elect a lump-sum payment under this section.\n(d) The lump-sum payment is computed by dividing the annuity determined under Subsection (e) by 12 and multiplying the result by the number of months the surviving spouse elects under Subsection (f) of this section.\n(e)  The annuity used to compute the lump-sum payment is determined in the manner provided by Section 5.01(f-1) of this Act for retired members, using:\n(1)  the deceased member's average total salary for all months, excluding the number of months immediately preceding the member's date of death that equal the number of months elected by the surviving spouse under Subsection (f) of this section; and\n(2)  the amount of service credit as determined by Subsection (g) or (h) of this section.\n(f)  The surviving spouse must elect the number of months used in computing the lump-sum payment.

If the fund owns real estate, it may, at its discretion, establish organizations described by Section 501(c)(2) or (25) of the code to hold title to the real estate.\n(d) The board shall have the ultimate responsibility for the investment of the reserve retirement funds.

Oct. 1, 1997.\nARTICLE 8. EXCESS BENEFIT PLAN FOR FIRE FIGHTERS AND POLICE OFFICERS\nSec. 8.01. CREATION OF PLAN.  A separate, nonqualified, unfunded excess benefit plan containing the provisions of this subchapter is created outside the fund.  The plan is intended to be a \"qualified governmental excess benefit arrangement\" within the meaning of Section 415(m) of the code.\nSec. 8.02. DEFINITIONS.  In this article:\n(1) \"Excess benefit participant\" means any member whose retirement benefits as determined on the basis of all qualified plans, without regard to the limitations of Section 5.10(a) of this Act and comparable provisions of other qualified plans, would exceed the maximum benefit under Section 415 of the code.\n(2) \"Excess benefit plan\" means the excess benefit plan created by this article for the benefit of eligible members.\n(3) \"Maximum benefit\" means the retirement benefit a member or the member's spouse, dependent child, or dependent parent is entitled to receive from all qualified plans in any month after applying Section 5.10(a) of this Act and any similar provisions of any other qualified plans designed to conform to Section 415 of the code.\n(4) \"Qualified plan\" means the fund and any other plan that is maintained by the municipality for the exclusive benefit of some or all of the members of the fund and that has been found by the Internal Revenue Service to be qualified or has been treated by the municipality as a qualified plan under Section 401 of the code.\n(5) \"Unrestricted benefit\" means the monthly retirement benefit a member or the member's spouse, dependent child, or dependent parent would have received under the terms of all qualified plans except for the restrictions of Section 5.10(a) of this Act and any similar provisions of any other qualified plans designed to conform to Section 415 of the code.\nSec. 8.03.

The actuary employed under Section 7.05 of this Act shall advise the board of the amount of benefits that may not be provided from the fund solely by reason of the limitations of Section 415 of the code and the amount of municipal contributions that will be made to the excess benefit plan rather than to the fund.\nSec. 8.05. FUNDING OF BENEFITS.    (a)  Contributions may not be accumulated under the excess benefit plan to pay future retirement benefits.  Instead, each payment of municipal contributions that would otherwise be made to the fund under Section 4.05 of this Act shall be reduced by the amount determined by the board as necessary to meet the requirements for retirement benefits under the excess benefit plan, including reasonable administrative expenses, until the next payment of municipal contributions is expected to be made to the fund.  The municipality shall then pay to the excess benefit plan out of the withheld contributions, not earlier than the 14th day before the date of each distribution of monthly retirement benefits is required to be made from the excess benefit plan, the amount necessary to satisfy the obligation to pay monthly retirement benefits from the excess benefit plan.  The board shall satisfy the obligation of the excess benefit plan to pay retirement benefits out of the municipal contributions transferred for that month.\n(b) Municipal contributions otherwise required to be made to the fund under Section 4.05 of this Act and any other qualified plan shall be divided into contributions required to pay retirement benefits under this article and contributions paid into and accumulated to pay the maximum benefits required under the qualified plan.

Benefits under this article are exempt from garnishment, assignment, attachment, judgment, and other legal process to the same extent as retirement annuities under Section 1.05 of this Act.\nActs 1993, 73rd Leg., ch. 824, Sec. 1.01 to 7.06, eff.
